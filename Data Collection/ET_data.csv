According to Adam Ball, the Vice president of Disney Water Parks and ESPN Wide World of Sports, runDisney, Walt Disney aims to create an enjoyable, memorable experience and a supportive environment. Everybody is there to provide care to each other, right from the cast to the participants.

What is runDisney marathon?
runDisney is the destination race series of Disney. The races taking place at Disneyland and Disney World are very famous and are sold out within a few minutes of the opening of registration.

All through the year, there are six on-field events which are the new Disneyland Halloween Half Marathon, making its debut this fall. Each live event features several races with courses that take the participants through parks and further.

Disney attempts to provide a race appealing to anybody whether they want to be running 26 miles or walking a 5K.

Fans who cannot go to the parks can also avail virtual races. There are two virtual events – the runDisney Virtual 12Ks of Christmas and the runDisney Virtual Series.

How to qualify for the Disney marathon?
Anyone of age 18 years and beyond is qualified for the Disney marathon registration. As per Adam Ball, some people have never run and some come to set a new personal record.

For participation, there are no qualifying time limits, but evidence of time is essential for higher starting placement for participants expecting to complete in below four hours and 30 minutes.

All the participants are required to maintain a speed of 16 minutes per mile for all on-field Disney races. A smaller group of volunteers who are known colloquially as the balloon ladies, keep that speed, carrying the rear with balloons as visual signs. There are pace cyclists as well. The participants unable to maintain pace might be dragged and relocated to the area of family reunion.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/fallout-76-nuke-codes-launch-site-locations-heres-what-you-may-want-to-know/articleshow/106459102.cms,"Fallout 76 allows players to deploy nuclear weapons against adversaries, transforming settlements into radioactive ruins. However, launching nukes involves specific steps, starting with seizing Launch Sites and acquiring weekly-changing Nuke Codes.

Understanding Fallout 76 Nuke Codes
Nuke Codes are essential inputs at Fallout 76 Nuke Sites to authorize missile launches. The aftermath yields high-level enemies and improved loot opportunities, albeit in a hazardous irradiated zone. Strategic preparation is crucial to navigate the dangers of nuclear fallout.

How to Input Nuke Codes in Fallout 76?
Before using Nuke Codes, players must complete main quests, join the Enclave Faction, and finish the ""I am Become Death"" quest. Obtaining Nuclear Keycards, eliminating enemies in silo dungeons, and entering Nuke Codes are subsequent steps. Three launch sites – Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie – await activation.

Current Fallout 76 Nuke Codes - January 1, 2023
Alpha: 44646696
Bravo: 44002093
Charlie: 22098388

Locate the Nuclear Launch Sites in Fallout 76
Each launch site corresponds to an area on the map. Alpha resides in Savage Divide's middle, Bravo is south of the Palace of the Winding Path, and Charlie is near the Savage Divide's bottom.

Weekly Nuke Codes
Given the weekly change in Nuke Codes, players must stay informed to maximize their strategic advantage in Fallout 76. Regularly check for the latest codes to unleash destruction and seize opportunities in the post-nuclear landscape.

FAQs:
How often do Fallout 76 Nuke Codes change, and why is it important for players to stay updated?
Fallout 76 Nuke Codes change weekly. Staying updated is crucial for strategic gameplay as the evolving codes impact missile launch authorization.

What precautions should players take before using Nuke Codes in Fallout 76, considering the aftermath of nuclear blasts?
Players must enter well-equipped, prepared for radiation. Nuclear blasts spawn higher-level enemies and better loot opportunities but transform locations into hazardous danger zones, inflicting intangible damage.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/is-retirement-on-your-list-in-2024-here-are-details-about-taxes-you-should-know/articleshow/106459029.cms,"It is a misconception that retirees do not need to be worried about taxes, whereas taxes can pose a significant burden for senior citizens, as retired people have a fixed income compelling them to spend thoughtfully.

In case your retirement is in the year 2024, it is essential that you become conscious about taxes as well as know the recent rules and regulations on the same.

Here are some important things to consider during your retirement:
Earned income can be contributed to an IRA for a tax break

The fact that you are planning to retire in 2024, does not translate to you not working at all.

Moreover, many retirees work in whichever way possible to stay occupied and get additional income. In case you are opting for this way, you will get a chance to make your contribution towards a traditional IRA.

By taking this method, you can avoid paying taxes on that income. Contributing to an IRA has no age limit but you have to give a part of your earned income.

However, if you are getting benefits from Social Security, this cannot be contributed to an IRA, as Social Security is regarded as income for taxes and not income that is earned.

On the other hand, if you are working in any job which includes a freelance gig, that income becomes eligible for an IRA.

A Roth conversion before retirement could be beneficial
If all of your savings are in a traditional IRA, it should be brought to your awareness that once you start making withdrawals, you will be facing taxes on the money you remove from your account. Not only that but eventually, you'll be forced to take the required minimum distributions.

Before your retirement, it will be beneficial if you convert a part of the traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, as those withdrawals are devoid of tax and also do not compel you to make withdrawals from your balance every year.

You are required to be very mindful while undertaking a conversion as the outcome can be a huge tax bill for you. It's best to talk to a financial adviser and accountant for the same.

Two states will no longer be putting taxes on Social Security
Social Security has the power to be taxed at the federal level and whether you will be paying those taxes on your benefits will depend on your earnings. However, it is taxed by several states.

In 2024, Missouri and Nebraska will no longer be taxing Social Security.

FAQs:
Can earned income be contributed to an IRA?
Many retirees work to keep themselves occupied and get additional income. In case you are opting for this way, you will get a chance to make your contribution towards a traditional IRA. By taking this method, you can avoid paying taxes on that income.

Which are the two states no longer putting taxes on Social Security?

With Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT IFSCA) Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking to recreate a Singapore by the Sabarmati -- Integrate Indian financial markets with international capital flows. A global nerve centre for new-age financial and technology services, as he put it to delegates recently, even when we had a thriving hub in Mumbai, an obvious choice, with both pre-existing infrastructure and talent, that had even allocated space which today sadly is going to be a terminus for the Bullet Train.

The decision to allow serving of inside the City premises, even with multiple fine prints, in a dry state like Gujarat will certainly lift the spirits of everyone who aspires to be work, live and play in this 15-year old free market oasis that already boasts of 580 operational entities, including 3 exchanges like international bullion exchange, 25 banks, with 9 foreign banks, 29 insurance entities, 2 foreign universities, and over 50 professional services providers, consulting, law, CA firms but no night life.

This should ideally be followed up with a relaxed liquor regimen across the state to boost , a cornerstone of the double engine BJP government.

Take a leaf out of Dubai which also an international financial centre like New York, Shanghai, Shenzhen, San Fran, London or Tokyo. It ended its 30% tax on alcohol sales in the sheikhdom on January 1 2023 and made its required liquor licenses free to obtain to further boost tourism. Over the years it has been relaxing rules over booze in the city state to allow sale of liquor even during the day in Ramazan, providing home delivery since Corona lockdown.

Smart businesses in the beginning of the 17th century set sail for London or Amsterdam. Their Asian outposts, Calcutta ( now Kolkata) and Manila were recognised as hubs in a growing network of European commerce, which have since lost its lustre. The 20th century saw the rise of New York City. And at the beginning of the 21st century, both trade and capital found a way to reach the southernmost tip of the Malay Peninsular - to the city state of Singapore, coinciding with the commensurate rise of Asia as the fastest growing economic bloc with thriving new global finance centers like Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore. But Hong Kong has become an Orwellian dystopia under Beijing’s authoritarianism and London’s pull out from the European bloc dulled its deal making prowess making both bustling metropolises but lesser international financial centres.

You can be drawn in by low tax rates, a deep reservoir of private banking talent, credible trust laws that aid inheritance planning and regulatory governance and lends credibility that rival Switzerland and other traditional centres that were the default jurisdictions for the high net worth individuals from around the world and even India but beyond the Singapore sling, penthouses and skyscrapers, jaw dropping rents, swanky airport connectivity, busiest trans-shipment and tax treaties, what really makes the difference is its cosmopolitan ethos and the quality of life. I call it the Dosa doctrine. Global spotlight on Swiss and Dubai banks have further propelled its position as the Switzerland of Asia but without the black money.



Regulators are key to creating an atmosphere where finance can flourish. A deep capital markets and banking services are obvious handmaidens. Both makes it easier to become a hub for wealth created elsewhere in the globe to be managed and invested. The establishment of the International Centres Authority as a unified regulator in 2020 has been a key milestone in ’s evolution. IFSCA has formulated 27 and more than 10 frameworks, opening up new avenues for investment. Within the 886 acres between Ahmedabad, the state’s biggest city and its capital Gandhinagar, bankers have cumulatively handled transactions worth $508 billion till July 2023; with total banking assets stood at $41.20 billion, and cumulative derivative transactions booked by banks were worth $632 billion.

Global think tank Z/Yen partners, which compiles an index of financial centres, looks at five areas of competitiveness: business environment, human capital, infrastructure, financial-sector development and reputation. Each segment is further split into four underlying buckets to deduce a final score for each city. New York tops that list in 2023, Mumbai a dismal 61, GIFT-CITY 67, below Madrid, Wellington, Chendu and even Casablanca.

Gujarat’s Canary Wharf may offer district cooling, an energy-efficient air conditioning system, as well as central waste, water and electricity management but that does not make it liveable. Bank of America, HSBC, JP Morgan, ICICI Bank may occupy glass and chrome skyscrapers that have risen from backwoods. But that will not help in talent migration. Schools would. Chic diners and modern healthcare in close proximity will make the City liveable.

By amending the teetotaller mandate – in place with greater rigidity in the state after it was created out of the erstwhile Bombay state in 1960, as a mark of respect to Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation and a Gujarati and fierce critic of the vice – Gift City will finally be able to woo young talent and ensure the project’s success. Around the world, liquor lubricates many finance deals. It all boils down to the after hours.

Remember the private banker who loves Singapore. He also said: “I cannot think of a vegetarian joint I can go for dinner in Hong Kong's central business district..”"
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-editorial/when-psus-start-to-flex-their-muscles/articleshow/106458665.cms,"Investors have bought enthusiastically in India's public sector and have been rewarded handsomely for their efforts. Public sector enterprises are leading the market capitalisation sweepstakes on specific government policies, and the expectation of policy continuity is fanning the exuberance. NTPC and Coal India have benefited from India's stand at climate talks that coal should not be singled out among fossil fuels for cutback commitments. LIC is in the process of transferring a slice of its profits to investors after listing. IRFC and REC are direct fallouts of GoI's bumped-up capital expenditure in railways and electrification. IOC improved its refining margins on easing crude oil prices, a process aided by New Delhi's decision to buy discounted Russian crude in circumvention of a Western blockade.

Beyond these top wealth creators, the overall performance of the pack of listed in 2023 is a validation of the government's economic management as well as its execution through state-owned enterprises. Alongside, incremental reforms in governance are helping close the valuation gap of PSUs with their private sector rivals. The third factor in play is GoI's stated intention of trimming its ownership in PSUs to promote efficiency. Investor expectations over languid disinvestment are being built up by their reading of the outcome of general elections later this year.

Investor behaviour has changed dramatically from much of India's reform experience since the 1990s when the accepted wisdom was to bet against state enterprise. The private sector led in productivity gains in sectors where state monopolies were being dismantled and built investor wealth. It would, however, be too early to read a turnaround in PSU productivity. Some of the PSU valuation increase is due to self-limiting causes like government capex and credit-funded consumption. The current bout of investor interest can feed a wider divestment pipeline with better exit prices for the government and improved market-led governance of PSUs."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-editorial/india-infrantic-the-faster-roads-ahead/articleshow/106458721.cms,"The time it takes to travel - people or goods - tells its own story. The average travel speed on highways in the US is over 100 kmph. In China, it is 90 kmph. In India, it is a paltry 47 kmph. But plans are afoot to push this figure up to 85 kmph on the national highway (NH) network. The ministry of road transport and highways plans to construct and expand approximately 41,000 km of NHs, including 15,000 km of high-speed, access-controlled corridors, by the fiscal 2031-32. Two critical aspects of the plan: one, decongesting highways in and around cities; two, building high-speed corridors (HSCs). India has 3,900 km of HSCs. This may go up to 11,000 km by 2026-27. GoI will be spending ₹19.5 lakh crore on this much-welcome upgrade.

Other than making travel for all less time-consuming, increased speeds on NHs could bring down the logistics cost to 9-10% of GDP from 13-14%. In countries such as Singapore and the US, the logistics cost is 8% or lower. This new plan also segues well with the planned rollout of 400 semi-high-speed, medium-distance Vande Bharat trains, 220 new airports, and doubling port capacity to 3,000 mtpa. Investments in EVs, solar, wind and hydrogen will pick up.

Overall, India is expected to spend $143 trillion on infrastructure between fiscals 2024 and 2030, more than twice the $67 trillion spent in the past seven financial years from 2017. Crisil expects India's GDP to grow at an average of 6.7% through FY2031, and rise in per-capita income from $2,500 to 4,500 by FY2031, creating a middle-income country. Infrastructure development, with a sharp focus on integrating sustainability, will be the key driver of growth. Yet, infra push is not just about creating megastructures. Watch out for its ripple effects."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/bliss-of-everyday-life/listening-to-imagine/articleshow/106458758.cms,"'You may say I'm a dreamer/ But I'm not the only one.' Listening to these words mixed with the music in John Lennon's 'Imagine' (rb.gy/m8ha3k) melts away much canker and cynicism, even if for the duration of this timeless song. The pleasure of listening to 'Imagine' is that of tasting Utopia - you know it is impossible, unreal, even foolish, and yet....

The song's simplicity creates a strange stitch that resonates with the human spirit even as one realises how ungraspable it is. Which is not a bad thing at all. And that is the very joy you derive out of it.

Barriers between people dissolve, and a world of unity and peace emerges for the duration of the song. Lennon's words evoke a sense of collective yearning for a better world.

The purity of his message and the sincerity in his delivery tug at the heartstrings - which he himself found to be 'too saccharine' at times - fostering a connection that goes beyond mere auditory stimulation. The iconic piano riff and Lennon's distinctive voice linger in the mind well after we return to the real world."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/demonstrating-democracy-the-2024-poll-cycle-is-a-strategic-opportunity-that-can-provide-india-leverage/articleshow/106458689.cms,"The strategic value of an election process has never been higher than now. And the manner in which this process plays out may just prove to be the unique differentiator among democracies as a significant clutch of democratic countries, including India and the US, go into polls this year. But why is this of any strategic consequence?


Democracies have been under stress in most top G20 countries, largely due to deep internal fissures that have polarised the polity. Election results are not easily accepted, margins are getting thinner, and threat of post-election violence, especially after what happened on Capitol Hill in January 2021, remains high. This has adversely affected global standing democratic powers, including the US, as they grapple with domestic challenges.


As a fallout, global institutions are under strain. The churn within democracies has allowed more space to autocratic and communist countries. The China-Russia combine has split the UN Security Council, almost rendering it ineffective. Other financial and multilateral institutions are experiencing a similar strain as the power balance tilts away from democracies.


In this vacuum, new rules of engagement have come into play. The general consensus is not to precipitate matters to a point that it might negatively impact the improving economic growth picture. However, countries are now willing to take risks against rules that structured the order and assert their influence - Russia against Ukraine, China against a UN tribunal award in the Philippines, Turkey in Azerbaijan, and renewed terrorism against Israel and its blowback.

Upheaval within powerful democracies has consequentially altered their hold and sway over international institutions. So, what's working are bilateral deals and informal groupings through which regular transactions occur. And they can prove to be effective, like the way in which the US is seeking to influence the West Asia situation by delivering the hard message to Iran and simultaneously working through formal and informal channels with other Arab nations.

The unwritten understanding is to not let oil prices soar, keep global inflation under check, and the Strait of Hormuz functional. The conflict is not dying down, just like in the Russia-Ukraine theatre, where again management through diplomatic and intelligence channels is just about holding up the bigger global picture within the frame than any real political progress being made on a way out/forward.

In this backdrop, a that is able to conduct a credible, acceptable election process will undoubtedly send out a strong political signal. India, on this score, is on a slightly different footing from other democracies. A lot of this has to do with its switch to EVMs, increasing voter participation, and its Election Commission persisting with the shift despite several challenges over two decades.

Elections alone are not a barometer of democracy. However, for a country once constantly criticised on rigged elections, to boast of turnout percentages in the 65-75% range, with rapidly improving numbers among women, is quite different to the general cynicism elsewhere. Governments have changed hands from Congress to BJP, and in states among regional parties, pointing to the robustness of the process.

That said, a lot more work needs to be done on pre-election violence, transparency in electoral spending and maintaining a higher standard electoral decorum. Given the heft at stake, the Indian election management system is positioned well to make a power statement on this score.

Why is this important? The health of the election process will provide a strong footing to whichever be the next government on the global stage. This is a unique situation. But in the backdrop of how the frittering of this process has weakened mature democracies, its strategic value cannot be overemphasised.

In the current environment, it will allow India better positioning to work on its own calculated risk agenda. The current practice, given the overall political flux, is for better positioned countries to take the risk by pushing the boundaries on a controversial agenda and then backing themselves to deal with the fallout. Barring players like Hamas, most traditional powers like China, Russia and Turkey have sought to move on these lines, though they have differed in intensity and method.

India, arguably, has done the same with the abrogation of Article 370. The international fallout was way more manageable in the prevailing environment than in the past. And, in this context, the holding of elections in Jammu and Kashmir could, by itself, prove to be an even stronger message on the credence of India's electoral process and plans ahead.

Finally, there's the issue of governance. Elections cannot leave societies divided permanently. A fair conduct of the process opens the space for a new government to heal the damage caused by scathing debates and campaigns during the election season.

The inclusion process usually happens through fair, non-discriminatory governance models, which go a long way in sealing the democracy statement within the initial few months. Let's not forget, the season of elections will continue in India beyond the , with special focus on how it evolves in Jammu and Kashmir.

Therefore, the 2024 election cycle is a strategic opportunity that, by itself, could provide significant leverage - an aspect that must remain thoroughly in sight for all stakeholders."

Curfew was reimposed in the three districts of the state.

A senior police officer who does not want to be named said that gunmen arrived in camouflage dress in the Lilong Chingjao area. There was indiscriminate firing. “ There was an altercation over ransom demand.”

The officer said that irate locals set some vehicles on fire. Curfew was reimposed in Thoubal, Imphal East and Imphal West.

Chief Minister N Biren Singh condemned the violence, and appealed to the people, particularly the residents of Lilong, for maintaining peace.

“Police are working to arrest those behind the attack. They will be arrested soon and punished as per the law,” he said.

More than 180 people have been killed and several hundred injured since ethnic violence broke out in Manipur on May 3 when a ‘Tribal Solidarity March’ was organised in the hill districts to protest against the majority Meitei community’s demand for Scheduled Tribe status.

The security forces have initiated a major search operation to nab the suspected militants, who attacked the Manipur Police commandos on Saturday and Sunday injuring five personnel seriously.

Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh also expressed his concern over the attacks on the forces and said that a delegation would soon go to Delhi to apprise the central leaders on the prevailing situation of the state.

Five Manipur Police commandos were injured in clashes with suspected Kuki militants in the state’s Tengnoupal district on Saturday and Sunday.

The injured personnel -- Diliangam Kamson, M.Priyokumar, N.Borjao, M.Sunil and Ponkhalung -- were given first aid at the Assam Rifles camp in Moreh and then brought to Regional Institute of Medical Sciences in Imphal, the official said.

Several tribal organisations alleged that many houses were burnt down by the attackers in Moreh areas since Saturday.

The Manipur Chief Minister, posting his statement on the X, said: “The unprecedented attacks against the state forces in recent times have become a serious national security threat.”

While the state and central security forces are actively engaged in maintaining control over the situation, it is also imperative for the combined security forces to adopt a robust and comprehensive approach to deal with these elements, who are relentlessly attempting to destabilise the state of Manipur, he said.

Singh said: “Joined a high level meeting in presence of Smt A Sharda Devi Ji, President BJP Manipur Pradesh, Hon’ble Ministers, Hon’ble MLAs and party karyakarta to deliberate on a stringent approach to deal with elements who are hell bent on destabilising Manipur.”

A delegation will also be going to Delhi soon to meet the central leaders in this regard, he added.

Moreh is just 4 km to the west of Myanmar’s largest border town Tamu. Moreh, which is 110 km south of Imphal, has been restive as a section of people are opposing the deployment of state forces in the area. The area had witnessed a series of violent incidents since May 3.

The accused planned to commit terror acts in India, said the National Investigation Agency' chargesheet, which was filed on Thursday against six people held in July 2023 during multiple raids in Maharashtra in the ISIS module case.

They have been identified as Tabish Siddiqui, Zulfikar Ali, Sharjeel Shaikh and Aakif Ateeque Nachan, Zubair Shaikh and Adnanali Sarkar.

The 4000-page chargesheet, which was filed in the court of Special NIA Judge A K Lahoti, has 16 protected witnesses.

It is revealed during investigation that the accused planned to commit terror acts to show support to ISIS in India and meetings were held in Borivali (in Thane district).

It is evident from the statement of witness that the accused had several meetings in Chhoti Masjid, Padgha-Borivali, wherein they used to plan the recruitment of gullible Muslim youth for Islamic State (ISIS), furthering the activities of Islamic State, propagating the ideology of Daesh ie. ISIS and to carry out violent jihad, the chargesheet said.

As per the chargesheet it is a terror module with international linkages, whereby the accused have undergone radicalization towards the concept of violent jihad and are willing to undertake 'Hijrat' (migration to land of jihad) for participating in the terror activities of ISIS.

Taking to X (formerly Twitter) on Monday, Anand Mahindra, shared a long note on why 1st January continues to hold such a fascination among the masses across cultures.

According to the tycoon New Year is met with such enthusiasm as it symbolises a new beginning, a new opportunity to start afresh.

“I believe New Year is special because it symbolises a new beginning. No matter how dark the year has gone by, the human spirit has an abiding capacity for hope. 2023 was a year characterised by conflict, climatic change, and a sluggish post-Covid recovery. The year ended with the world crying out for renewal. The first day of the new year opens a new chapter, a fresh opportunity for optimism and renewal.

RPG Enterprises Chairman Harsh Goenka wrote that he hoped that in 2024, people learn to find joy in little things and never run out of Wi-Fi!

“May your dreams be daring, your spirits high, and your Wi-Fi never weak. Here's to creating moments that matter, laughing in the face of challenges, and finding joy in the little things. Cheers to new adventures! “ he wrote.

Harsh Mariwala, the founder and chairman of Marico, had a different take on the significance of the New Year. The entrepreneur wrote that although 1st January symbolises an opportunity for change, we don’t see a set date or timeline to transform ourselves for the better

“While New Year's resolutions are a tradition for many, I personally believe that the right time for change doesn’t just have to be January 1st. True new beginnings spark anytime you're ready for a change. Wishing you all happiness, success, and the courage to embrace new beginnings whenever they call to you,” tweeted the Marico boss.

He said that he is in touch with Baruah.

Sarma said ""As the political head of the state, I will continue to reach out to him. I usually talk to him every three or six months and I plan to speak to him again soon, but I don't expect him to come for talks immediately,"" Sarma said during an interaction with journalists.

He said that it is not easy for Barua to give up the issue of sovereignty, but he must realise that the people of Assam do not want it anymore. ""He is fighting for the people of the state, but people want development and not an independent Assam,"" he said.

""The ULFA charter of demands was prepared several decades ago and if Barua comes and stays in the state for 15 days, he will also change the demands as Assam is now a land of peace and tranquillity. We have kept the channels for discussions open, but we do not see talks happening in the near future. This is a long process which will continue,"" the CM added.

With a peace pact with United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) inked, Assam government is now trying to engage ULFA (independent) in the peace negotiations.

Baruah has remained aloof to peace overtures of the government and has stated on several occasions that it will sit for talks if “restoration of Assam’s sovereignty” is made the agenda of discussion.

Baruah while talking to local news channels on Saturday said that he is not upset or upbeat with the pact. He is not averse to dialogue. “We are open to discussion keeping in history and principles of the state. There is no problem discussing our core issue. Just discussing our core issue will not mean that it is against the constitution of India. Discussion of the issue should not scare anyone as if a tiger has come out.”

Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma in New Delhi on Friday said peace accord will stimulate the anti-talk ULFA faction led by Paresh Baruah to come for talks.

Earlier Sarma had said that balance has to be struck between the core demand of militant ULFA-I and limits of the Constitution of India.

ULFA- which is also known as the anti-talk faction, had unilaterally extended the ceasefire by three months in the past. ULFA had declared a unilateral ceasefire owing to COVID-19 pandemic.

ULFA suffered a split after several top leaders under its chairman, Arbinda Rajkhowa following their arrest in Bangladesh decided to join peace parleys. Those refusing the peace process rechristened themselves as ULFA (independent). The Paresh Baruah led ULFA faction is a banned organisation and manifested itself with a new name in 2012."

An official in Aizawl said that necessary formalities, including biometric processes, are being done and the authorities concerned are in touch with the higher authorities to get clearance to repatriate the Myanmar Army personnel.

""Once the ongoing formalities are completed and clearance from the higher authorities received, the Myanmarese soldiers would be handed over to their authority in Tamu through the Moreh border in Manipur,"" the official, who did not want to be identified said.

According to officials, the on Friday fled to Mizoram’s Lawngtlai district with their arms and ammunition, and approached the Assam Rifles after their camps near the India-Myanmar border were overrun by the Arakan Army fighters.

Some of the fleeing Myanmar soldiers were critically injured in the gun battle and basic medical treatment provided to them by the Assam Rifles.

The soldiers are now in the custody of Assam Rifles at Parva in Lawngtlai.

Fierce gun battles between the Myanmar Army and the armed fighters resumed last week in areas close to the Indian border leading to the fresh influx of soldiers into Indian territory.

In November, a total of 104 Myanmar soldiers, including officers, fled to Mizoram in different phases after their camps near the border were overrun by pro-democracy armed groups.

Since November 13, Myanmar soldiers fled to the Indian territory in different phases after their camps in Chin state were captured by the Chin National Defence Force, the armed wing of the Chin National Organisation. They were airlifted by the Indian Air Force to Moreh, from where they were repatriated to Tamu, the nearest town on the Myanmar side.

Besides soldiers, over several thousand Myanmarese, including women and children, took shelter in Mizoram's Champhai and other districts since last month following the gunfights between Myanmar Army and CNDF cadres.

That means 20 minutes of true meditation can result in eight hours of work effectiveness. One needs to follow five simple steps in daily life to have a fulfilling experience in meditation.

First step is to start your day with a few minutes of close communion with God in meditation. During the early morning hours, when nature is silent and pure, experience yourself as a soul and enter the soul world and float in it, touching and absorbing the pure vibrations of Supreme Soul.

After meditating, read or listen to godly wisdom and feel that the Supreme Teacher is teaching you with immense love. This will inspire you to fill every thought, word and action in the day with love, kindness and contentment.

The third step is to experience God's qualities. You need to add pure and divine vibrations to every action, by remembering God before any action, feeling His presence and taking His guidance during the action, and thanking God after finishing the action.

Fourth, every morning, share with God a quality chart for the day. Depending on the day's timetable, write in your mind or visualise how will you bring the qualities of God in every action.

Last, for a deeper experience of godly wisdom and virtues, recharge your inner self in meditation and share your experience with others to spiritually empower and bring them closer to God."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/india-vs-south-africa-going-into-the-2nd-test-india-should-worry-more-about-their-bowling-stocks/articleshow/106458836.cms,"It’s time for some truths. India put together one of their most insipid performances overseas at Centurion to lose the first Test by an innings and 32 runs. Although the pitch aided a fair amount of seam movement on the first day, it was not one on which this Test team should have been bowled out for 245 and 131. Equally, it was not a surface on which this bowling attack should have conceded 408.

Batting failures always attract plenty of attention because they tend to be dramatic. But, going into the second Test in Cape Town, India should worry more about their bowling stocks.

Aside from Jasprit Bumrah, none of the other quick bowlers acquitted themselves well. Giving Mohammad Siraj some leeway, let’s consider the split in how India bowled in Centurion.

Their three experienced campaigners, Bumrah, Siraj and Ravichandran Ashwin, bowled 69.4 overs for 201 runs and 7 wickets.

That sounds pretty good for this unit on overseas soil, even if Siraj went at 3.79 per over on a seaming track. But, the problem was that Shardul Thakur and Prasidh Krishna had combined returns of 194 for 2 in 39 overs.

Shardul has been a part of the Indian Test team overseas because he ostensibly lends balance as a fast-bowling all-rounder. However, in his 11 Test matches, Shardul averages a shade under 20 with the bat. While he clearly has heart and the ability to do a job, he has not delivered enough to justify selection over another specialist bowler, or even Ashwin, who has four Test hundreds.

The fact that countries such as South Africa prepare pitches that give nothing to spinners, in search of invaluable World Test Championship points, makes it tricky for India to play their best combination, which is Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja plus three quicks.

But, Shardul is virtually at the end of a long rope as the medium pacer who bats a bit. With the ball, his returns are 31 wickets from 11 Tests and he leaks runs and denies his captain control when not at his best. Aside from one spell of 7 for 61 at the Wanderers in Johannesburg when India toured South Africa last, he has given too little.

With Hardik Pandya ruling himself out of contention for red-ball cricket — he has not played a first-class match in five years — there is no allrounder to balance the playing eleven. The upside of Shardul delivering is so huge that he has been given a long rope. But, his failure to live up to expectations means course correction is in order.

The defensive approach would be to play another specialist batsman if India refuse to pick Jadeja and Ashwin together in overseas conditions that do not help slow bowling. But, there is an opportunity to take a risk of a different kind.

Mukesh Kumar, an out-and-out swing bowler, is available, as is Avesh Khan, a strong, hit-the-deck option. Dropping Prasidh after one bad outing would be cruel. He has all the makings of a fast bowler India need in overseas conditions: height, flexibility, release of the ball and accuracy.

Prasidh will be the first to admit that he did not bowl as well as he could have on Test debut, but it’s important to remember he had only played 12 first class matches before he made his Test debut.

Remember what Ishant Sharma or Umesh Yadav or even the great Zaheer Khan were like at the same vantage? It’s worth sticking with Prasidh for the moment because leaving him out after just one opportunity could be crushing. He will learn, and he will bowl better than he did at Centurion, and it’s not about him, it’s about the team getting the right kind of bowler ready in their ranks for the next five-year window.

Mukesh or Avesh coming into the mix in place of Shardul would be an aggressive move. This would place a little more responsibility on the batsmen to do their job, but it will also give Rohit Sharma more options with the ball.

Although locals in Cape Town are doing their best to host five days of Test cricket in the baking heat, the groundsman was quite clear that there would be an even and generous grass covering on the pitch. Pace and good carry are expected.

This means India should think very hard about taking 20 wickets, about putting pressure on the opposition. This is unlikely to be a draw, so they must press forward, being aggressive rather than conservative, 0-1 down in the series.

Two spinners is one way to go, if both are fit because that gives you control and batting depth. Or one and four genuine wicket-taking bowlers, led by Bumrah. In either scenario, Shardul does not fit in. The final call is with Rohit, and it’s not an easy one.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/unlocking-the-secrets-of-five-nights-at-freddys-2-cast-release-and-more/articleshow/106458743.cms,"The horror sensation ""Five Nights at Freddy’s,"" directed by Emma Tammi, shook the box office in 2023, becoming Blumhouse Productions' highest global earner. The live-action adaptation of Scott Cawthon’s renowned video game series garnered immense popularity, leaving fans eager for more frights. Now, the question looms: will ""Five Nights at Freddy’s 2"" emerge to haunt audiences?

The Silent Sequel Speculation
Despite its box office triumph, Universal and Blumhouse have maintained a surprising silence regarding the sequel. While official confirmations are yet to surface, the deafening silence might not spell doom. The success of the first film, produced on a $20 million budget, sets the stage for a potentially lucrative sequel. Forgoing a follow-up would be akin to discarding a treasure trove of earnings.

The delay in sequel confirmation could be attributed to negotiations for a larger stake in the franchise. This likely involves intricate deals with cast, crew, and potential merchandising partners. The studio might be strategically navigating through contractual intricacies to ensure a solid foundation for the sequel.

Release Window: Halloween 2024
Rumors circulate about the release window for ""Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,"" with Halloween 2024 being the prime target. Building on the success of the first film, producers aim for a strategic release, capitalizing on the genre-friendly weekend before Halloween. Considering the swift production-to-release timeline of the inaugural film, a 2024 release appears plausible.

Filming Rumors and Production Scope
Speculations about filming for ""Five Nights at Freddy’s 2"" point to a spring 2024 kick-off. The practical approach to on-screen action in the first film, minimizing CGI, potentially streamlines the filming process. With a reported start in May-June, the production aims to wrap up in time for an October release, promising another dive into Freddy Fazbear’s horrors.

Returning Cast and Character Dynamics
While details about the sequel's cast remain undisclosed, the potential return of key members hinges on the direction the narrative takes. The possibility of revisiting the core group or exploring events around another Fazbear Entertainment property opens avenues for various characters. Matthew Lillard's villainous William Afton, a pivotal figure, could make a return, providing essential lore to the FNAF community.

Lillard, expressing enthusiasm about potential sequels, hinted at a deeper exploration of the franchise's lore. The next movie could delve into prequel territory, shedding light on untold stories within the eerie universe. Whether through flashbacks or spectral apparitions, William Afton's influence is expected to persist, weaving a tapestry of horror.

Directorial Prospects: Emma Tammi’s Return
The success of Emma Tammi's direction in the first film positions her as a likely candidate for helming the sequel. Despite criticisms directed at the story and characters, Tammi's direction and cinematography received commendation. While no official confirmation exists, the prospect of Tammi steering the sequel seems plausible.

In an interview before the first film's release, Tammi expressed hope for sequel opportunities while emphasizing the team's dedication to ensuring the debut film stands on its own merits. The staggering success of ""Five Nights at Freddy’s"" globally and on streaming platforms amplifies the chances of Tammi returning to guide the eerie narrative.

As 2024 unfolds, fans eagerly await official announcements and updates on ""Five Nights at Freddy’s 2."" The franchise, built on a rich gaming legacy, continues to captivate audiences, promising more spine-chilling tales and expanding the lore that fans crave. However, until official confirmations materialize, the anticipation remains tinged with the cautionary adage: don't count your Chicas before they've hatched.

FAQs:
Is Five Nights at Freddy's 1 or 2 better?
Undoubtedly, FNAF 2 stands out as one of the finest games in the FNAF series. With an array of new animatronics and heightened challenges, especially with the absence of doors, it offers an engaging experience. The game also features hidden minigames that delve deeper into the FNAF lore, accessible only upon encountering a game over screen.

What is FNAF 3 based on?
In this game, players take on the persona of an anonymous security guard stationed at Fazbear's Fright, a horror-themed attraction modeled after Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a family restaurant that ceased operations three decades ago. The game's premise involves menacing animatronic characters launching attacks on anyone in their vicinity after the clock strikes midnight.

And, yet, we still haven't been able to tackle, let alone solve, a serious problem plaguing humanity: the deluge of 'Happy New Year' messages that pour into our phones like lava during the first few days of the new year.

We suggest two test-driven options to tackle the menace: (1) Do not reply to any new year felicitations - not even the ones that mention you by your name and are not bulk-sent. (2) Send back a Happy Diwali or Happy Birthday message to utterly confuse the sender, and send across a subtle subtext that wishing someone on a special occasion is so effortless that it really lacks any meaning. The problem usually evaporates by the first week of January. But there are those stubborn wishers who linger till the next phone contact is made, that could very well stretch out till - horror of horrors - February 13. The buffer of Valentine's Day acts as a helpful vaccine to make the viral wish finally stop. So, while we're at it, wishing you a very Happy New Year, regardless of whether you wish us back or not."

The blue-chip NSE Nifty 50 settled 0.05% higher at 21,742 points, while the S&P BSE Sensex added 0.04% to 72,272. Both indices had risen about 0.5% each to record highs in the afternoon session, before surrendering gains in the closing minutes.
Here's how analysts read the market pulse:
""Nifty remained volatile throughout the session as traders remained indecisive. On the hourly chart, the Nifty fell below 20 DMA on an intraday basis before closing on a positive note. Going forward, a decisive fall below 21,650 might call for a directional fall in the market. On the higher end, a close above 21,750 might take the index towards the higher levels,"" said Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities.

Avdhut Bagkar of StoxBox, said, ""To recoup the losing bias, the index must close over 21,800 on a decisive note. Selling pressure may intensify if the support of 21,500 is taken out on an aggressive note. Option data showed a spike in 21,700 PE, with 21,800 CE witnessing writing.""

That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Tuesday's action:

The US remained closed on Monday on New Year’s Day.

Most of the European stock markets were shut on Monday on account of the New Year’s day.

After hitting a fresh record high on the first day of the calendar year, Nifty on Monday ended 11 points up to form a high-wave type candlestick pattern on the daily chart.

The positive chart pattern like higher tops and bottoms is intact on the daily chart and Nifty is currently forming a new higher top of the sequence. A decisive move above 21,850 level is expected to nullify the present bearish effect and that could open more upside for the near term. Immediate support is placed at 21,550 level, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities.

Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence () showed bullish trade on the counters of Sun Pharma Advanced Research, Vodafone Idea, Fortis Healthcare, CESC, LIC, and Ashok Leyland, among others.

The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

The MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of Century Plyboards, SBI Card, Info Edge, Indiamart Intermesh, L&T, and Swan Energy, among others. Bearish crossover on the MACD on these counters indicates that they have just begun their downward journey.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/air-india-derosters-pilot-involved-in-hard-landing-incident-in-dubai-orders-probe/articleshow/106458356.cms,"In what could have been a disastrous landing, an Air India flight was involved in a rough landing incident in Dubai on December 20, but fortunately nothing bad happened. The plane that went through the hard landing was a 5.5-year-old Airbus A320neo (VT CIQ) which did not suffer structural damage when it made the heavy landing (3.5 G) and came to a stop safely, TOI reported.

But the incident didn't go well with the Air India administration, and the pilot who was flying the aircraft has been removed from duties until the completion of the investigation. Meanwhile, the plane will remain grounded in Dubai for a week and undergo extensive checks before it is allowed to fly back to Air India's engineering base in Mumbai.

Flight tracking sites show the plane operated to Mumbai on December 27 with its cruising altitude below 10,000 feet, indicating an unpressurised ferry. This means it came home for repairs after being allowed one landing which aircraft-makers allow after studying the digital flight data recorder (DFDR) to the airline’s engineering base as a ""substandard ferry (without passengers) flight.""

An Air India spokesperson told TOI: ""An investigation has already been initiated, as per DGCA norms. The pilot was appropriately trained and licensed to fly the aircraft. He has been off-rostered till the process of inquiry is on as per norms.""

The heavy landing happened when the aircraft operated as AI 933 from Kochi to Dubai. Flight tracking websites show that the next flight was to Mumbai on December 27. It has not flown since, as per flight tracking sites.

Senior pilots who have operated the A320 for decades told TOI: ""This aircraft made a landing into Dubai exceeding the manufacturer’s landing gear structural limitation. It can cause extensive damage to the landing gear structure. Depending on the age of the aircraft and metal fatigue, a young plane may withstand that particular landing but for subsequent landings the structural integrity can fail leading to structural failure.""

Major engineering investigations have to be carried out before an aircraft that has suffered such a landing is released for further revenue passenger flights so as to ensure its structural integrity is intact. Aircraft-makers often allow airlines to operate a ""substandard ferry back to major engineering base"" on such planes from the place where they might have suffered damage during a hard landing after studying the digital flight data recorder (DFDR), say pilots.

In this case also, the hard landing happened at an airport which was not the airline's (AI) engineering base. So the plane flew to Mumbai with a crushing altitude of less than 10,000 feet at which it does not need a pressurised cabin.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/australian-olympic-cyclist-melissa-hoskins-dies-at-32-in-tragic-accident/articleshow/106458003.cms,"Melissa Hoskins, a revered Australian Olympic track cyclist and former world champion, tragically passed away at the age of 32 in a devastating incident. Confirmation from the South Australian Police revealed that she was struck by a vehicle in Adelaide, Australia, leading to fatal injuries despite immediate care at the Royal Adelaide Hospital.

Known for her remarkable achievements in track cycling, Hoskins secured the world champion title and set a global record in 2015 as an integral part of Australia’s women’s team pursuit quartet. Her dedication shone through in her appearances at the 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games, narrowly missing a medal in the 2012 London Games by a mere 0.181 seconds.

Following this tragic incident, a 33-year-old man faces serious charges including causing death by dangerous driving, driving without due care, and endangering life. While the identity of the individual wasn't disclosed in the police statement, local media identified the person as Rohan Dennis, Hoskins' husband. Dennis, a well-known cyclist with two world time trial champion titles and a Tour de France stage win, has been associated with this unfortunate event.

Despite attempts to confirm details from the South Australian Police and Adelaide Magistrates Court regarding the accused individual and the forthcoming court appearance date, official confirmation remains pending. CNN's attempts to reach out to Dennis for a statement through his website and management team have remained unanswered.

Hoskins, who retired from competitive cycling following the Rio Olympic Games, had tied the knot with Dennis in 2018 and was a devoted mother of two children. Her unexpected demise has triggered an outpouring of condolences from the cycling community, with fellow athletes, including Olympic gold medalist Anna Meares, expressing profound sorrow and extending sympathies to Hoskins' family and friends.

CPA Women, a global association representing female cyclists, conveyed shock and condolences, acknowledging Hoskins’ significant impact within the cycling world and sending heartfelt thoughts to her loved ones.

Formerly associated with Liv AlUla Jayco, Hoskins’ previous cycling team expressed deep sorrow at the loss, emphasizing her enduring legacy and the enduring influence she had on the sport's community.

The passing of Melissa Hoskins marks a significant loss in the world of cycling, leaving behind a legacy of excellence and resilience that will be remembered by many.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/uk/donny-van-de-beek-completes-loan-move-to-eintracht-frankfurt-from-manchester-united/articleshow/106458077.cms,"Manchester United midfielder Donny van de Beek has finalized his temporary transfer to Eintracht Frankfurt, sealing the deal until the culmination of the ongoing season. The move includes an enticing option for the Bundesliga club to transform the loan into a permanent acquisition, extending beyond the current season.

The 26-year-old Dutch international has encountered limited opportunities at Manchester United since his transition from Ajax in September 2020, featuring merely six times as a starter in the Premier League. His sole appearance this season involved a late substitution during a 1-0 loss to Crystal Palace in September.

Acknowledging the need for a shift in Van de Beek's career trajectory, United's manager Erik ten Hag advocated for the midfielder's move to reignite his professional journey. Frankfurt's sports director, Markus Krosche, expressed the club's enthusiasm about acquiring Van de Beek, citing his alignment with their gameplay and crucial role within the team structure.

Throughout his tenure at Manchester United, Van de Beek amassed a total of 62 appearances across various competitions, netting two goals. The loan agreement between Eintracht and United involves financial aspects, with the Bundesliga side expected to cover the majority of Van de Beek's wages during his loan tenure.

The potential permanency of the transfer holds a defined fee structure, amounting to 11 million euros (£9.5 million), supplemented by 3 million euros (£2.6 million) in add-ons, should Eintracht opt for a long-term commitment.

Van de Beek, who previously underwent a loan stint at Everton in 2022, encountered a setback in the previous season due to a severe knee injury, resulting in his absence during the latter half of the season at Manchester United.

At present, Eintracht Frankfurt holds the sixth position in the Bundesliga standings, trailing nine points behind the top four teams, concurrently participating in the Europa Conference League play-offs. The Bundesliga is presently on its winter break, with Eintracht's upcoming fixture scheduled against RB Leipzig on January 13th.

Van de Beek's transition to Eintracht Frankfurt marks a pivotal moment in his career, offering a prospect for rejuvenation and a fresh start within the Bundesliga landscape, while also providing Manchester United with the possibility of reshaping their squad dynamics.

Even as the exchanges have sought clarification on the news report from the company, the stock ended with 6% gains at Rs 16.95.

The story was published today as 'Elon's Starlink Tie-Up Talks In Market Pumps Vodafone Idea To The Skies In India'.

The reply was awaited at the time of filing the story. This was the second straight session of gains for the telecom counter, which has surged up to 26% in the last two sessions.

Monday's price action was supported by strong volumes with over 178 crore shares getting traded on the NSE around the closing time. On the BSE, the spurt in volume was by 1.66 times.

The stock is currently trading above its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs). The price action has pulled the stock into an overbought zone with an RSI at 72, according to Trendlyne. However, MFI for the counter is still at 64 which indicates that a further upside cannot be ruled out. A number above 70 is considered to be overbought while below 30 is oversold.

Vodafone Idea shares have delivered multibagger returns of 124% over the last 12 months and have outperformed the Nifty which itself has given impressive 19% returns during this period.

Despite the rally, the stock has traded with considerable stability with a 1-year beta of 0.7 according to Trendlyne.

The stock has been rallying on favourable triggers. In September, Vodafone Idea made a 50% payment of their licence fees and spectrum usage charge (SUC) dues for the March quarter.

Last year, in April the company also announced the appointment of Kumar Mangalam Birla, as an Additional Director (Non-Executive and Non-Independent). Birla also serves as the chairman of Aditya Birla Group, a conglomerate which has business interests in 14 sectors including cement, insurance and retail.

The company's consolidated net loss widened to Rs 8,738 crore for the quarter ended September 2023. The company had posted a loss of Rs 7,840 crore in the preceding June quarter and Rs 7,595 crore in the year-ago period.

Revenue from operations rose by a marginal 0.9% to Rs 10,716 crore in the second quarter, compared with Rs 10,615 crore in the same quarter of last year. ARPU (average revenue per user) for the reporting quarter stood at Rs 142, compared with Rs 139 in the previous quarter, showing a sequential growth of 2.1%."

While the first season garnered acclaim, the anticipation for the next installment has grown, especially with the introduction of three new characters: Karloff, Wolfgang, and Annie.

Karloff, the first addition to the cast, is described as a young, athletic male teen, adding an element of physicality to the ensemble. The character's distinctive feature is the requirement for the actor to wear prosthetics, hinting at a unique and visually captivating presence.

Wolfgang, the next character in line, is portrayed as a charming and confident male teen. With these characteristics, Wolfgang brings an intriguing dynamic to the Nevermore Academy, where Wednesday's adventures unfold. The charming quality suggests potential for interesting interactions with the existing characters.

Annie, the final addition (for now), introduces a young girl aged between 12 to 14. Described as whip-smart and wise beyond her years, Annie brings intellectual depth to the narrative. Her presence may introduce fresh perspectives and contribute to the overall quirkiness of the Addams universe.

In a video featuring the stars of ""Wednesday,"" including Jenna Ortega, Emma Myers, Hunter Doohan, and Joy Sunday, the cast expressed uncertainty about the upcoming season's storyline, adding an air of mystery to the anticipation. Despite being in the dark about the plot, the cast members, along with the fans, eagerly await the new season's twists and turns.

Jenna Ortega, who assumes the role of Wednesday Addams, continues to be a central figure in the series. With her notable performance and portrayal of the iconic character, Ortega is set to lead the cast into the sophomore season's adventures. The trio of new characters, along with the confirmation of a ""new member of the Addams family,"" promises to enrich the series with fresh dynamics and unexpected developments.

Speculation arises about the identity of this new Addams family member, with Wolfgang being a potential candidate. Drawing on references from the 1992 animated series, where Uncle Wolfgang is mentioned, the character breakdown suggests a familial connection, possibly as a cousin to Wednesday. The secrecy surrounding the new Addams member adds an element of intrigue to the upcoming season.

As production for ""Wednesday"" Season 2 relocates to Ireland, shifting from the first season's Romanian backdrop, fans can anticipate a change in scenery while the essence of the Addams universe remains intact. Filming is slated to commence in April 2024, with much of the original cast returning to reprise their roles, ensuring continuity and familiarity in the macabre and delightful world of Wednesday Addams and Nevermore Academy.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/petition-filed-in-sc-against-new-criminal-laws-passed-by-parliament/articleshow/106458325.cms,"A petition challenging the enactment of three new sets of law that seek to overhaul India's penal codes has been filed in the Supreme Court, claiming they suffered from many ""defects and discrepancies"". The Lok Sabha had on December 21 passed three key legislations -- the Bharatiya Nyaya (Second) Sanhita, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha (Second) Sanhita, and the Bharatiya Sakshya (Second) Bills. President Droupadi Murmu gave her assent to the bills on December 25.

These new laws-the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and the Bharatiya Sakshya Act-will replace the Indian Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Evidence Act.

While seeking a stay on the operation of the three laws, the PIL filed by advocate Vishal Tiwari said they were enacted without any parliamentary debate as most of the opposition members were under suspension.

The plea has sought directions from the court to immediately constitute an expert committee to assess the viability of the three new criminal laws.

""The new criminal laws are far more draconian and establish police state in reality and violate every provision of fundamental rights of the people of India. If the British laws were considered colonial and draconian, then the Indian laws stand now far more draconian as in British period you could keep a person in police custody for a maximum of 15 days. Extending 15 days to 90 days and more, is a shocking provision enabling police torture,"" the plea said.

The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita encompasses offences such as acts of secession, armed rebellion, subversive activities, separatist activities or endangering the sovereignty or unity in a new avatar of the sedition law.

According to the new laws, anyone purposely or knowingly, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or by electronic communication or by use of financial means, or otherwise, excites or attempts to excite secession or armed rebellion or subversive activities, or encourages feelings of separatist activities or endangers sovereignty or unity and integrity of India or indulges in or commits any such act shall be punished with imprisonment for life or with imprisonment which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.

According to IPC Section 124A, which deals with sedition, anyone involved in the crime may be punished with life imprisonment or with a three-year jail term. Under the new laws, 'Rajdroh' has got a new term 'Deshdroh', while doing away with the reference to the British crown. Loosely explained, Rajdroh refers to rebellion or an act against the ruler, while Deshdroh represents such acts against the nation.

Also, for the first time, the word terrorism has been defined in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. It was absent in the IPC. Under the new laws, the magistrate's power to impose fines has been increased as well as the scope of declaring a proclaimed offender.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/planning-to-lose-weight-in-2024-check-out-diet-plans-to-follow-this-year/articleshow/106458312.cms,"“New year, new me” – this New Year resolution is the one we keep on hearing once the date is 1st Jan every year. Among all the New Year resolutions, the most common of them revolve around fitness, weight loss, and hitting the gym. Especially due to the pandemic-induced shock, the majority of people are focussing much on health and fitness and this is a growing category.

Disadvantages of strict diet plans
It is not wrong to wish for a lifestyle that is healthier in 2024, however, it comes with the risk of falling into the trap of emphasizing more on how we look rather than how we feel from the inside. Strict eating and popular dietary plans as well as heavy workout routines are something that appeal to most people in the short run, leading to burnout in the long term. This can eventually take the form of a lack of interest and formation of habits that are detrimental to health.

According to a study which was published by The BMJ, the medical journal in the year 2020, in the long run, weight loss diets are not so effective, and a huge part of the weight that is lost is gained by the participants again within one year.

The study was on 22,000 adults who were overweight and suffering from obesity and were following popular diets such as the Weight Watchers, Atkins diet, the Mediterranean diet, and the Jenny Craig diet for six months on average.

In the initial period of six months, certain health parameters such as cholesterol, blood pressure, and weight, had witnessed improvement in most of the participants. However, the positive impact disappeared after 12 months except the Mediterranean diet which helped in the improvement of cholesterol levels with consistency.

It may be appealing to dedicate ourselves to the fast-acting diet plan for transforming our bodies in 2024, but having a little bit of skepticism can help us differentiate between the short-term ineffective solutions and the long-term effective ones.

Here are details about some of the popular diets to try this new year:
Keto

A ketogenic or keto diet revolves around a diminished intake of carbohydrates supported by a greater intake of protein and fat. In general, the people who follow this diet, derive around 20% of their everyday calories from protein, 70 – 80% from fat, and around 5% from carbohydrates. The dearth of carbs compels the body to go into ‘ketosis’ making fat, the body’s primary fuel to be burned for being utilized as energy.

Professionals have given warnings that a keto diet is not good for improvement in overall health. Putting a limit on carb intake at extreme levels can lead to the body breaking down not only fat but also tissue and muscle.

Its strictness can also lead to a diet that lacks other nutrition sources such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

Mediterranean Diet
The Mediterranean diet has been applauded for being one of the most effective and successful diet plans that exist. It puts a focus on healthy foods that are good for the heart, mostly consumed by people residing in the Mediterranean areas, and include foods like nuts, legumes, plants, veggies, and fruits.

It does not emphasize eradication or restrictions, but instead focuses on healthier alternatives such as the replacement of red meat with poultry and fish, and butter with olive oil.

This diet places more importance on overall health than weight loss without providing many guidelines on quantity, way to eat, and others. People who adopt this diet have to bring a complete change in lifestyle for the long term to see the results

Fasting diets
Intermittent fasting is a diet plan focused not on what we eat but on the time when we eat it, relying on designated periods of eating and fasting, happening within a stipulated time frame. Its benefits are decreased intake of calories, greater flexibility with the different categories of food, and others.

Paleo diet
Paleo is a low-carb diet plan focussing on vegetables, fruits, and protein. The name Paleo has been derived from the Paleolithic era in history, following the theory that those adopting it should have an eating plan like that of hunter-gatherers, 2.6 million years ago.

It puts more emphasis on healthy foods that contain antioxidants, potassium, and important nutrients with less dependence on processed foods.

However, it may lead to eating habits that lack vitamin D and calcium, culminating in health conditions such as heart disease, low blood sugar levels, constipation, bone fractures, kidney stones, and others.

Atkins diet
The Atkins diet is focused on net carbs rather than total carbs, coming in two versions - Atkins 40 and Atkins 20.

WW, Noom and other diet apps
There are many apps to help one on their weight loss journey. These include the Noom app, and the Weight Watchers app (WW). One should consult reliable apps that are run by trusted professionals.

FAQs:
What is the risk of following a strict diet plan in 2024?
Strict eating and popular dietary plans as well as heavy workout routines are something that appeal to most people in the short run, leading to burnout in the long term.

What are some popular diet plans to follow in 2024?
Some of the popular diet plans to follow in 2024 are the Keto diet, the Mediterranean diet, the Fasting diet, the Atkins diet, the Paleo diet, and others.

Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that private madrassas are protected under the constitution as minority run institutions. “The Assam police and Education department are working, and we will be able to reduce private madrassa by 1000 from 3000. We are in negotiation with Madrassa bodies, and we have told them that you are not providing these basic requirements.”

Earlier stated that State-funded Madrassas are minority institutions and were established and administered by the minority is a claim which has no foundation and is hence not acceptable.

Upholding the constitutional validity of the Assam Repealing Act 2020, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia and Justice Soumitra Saikia dismissed a writ petition filed by 13 petitioners and stated, “Consequently, the claim of the petitioners that these Madrasas are minority institutions and were established and administered by the minority is a claim which has no foundation and is hence not acceptable”.

The Assam government brought a law which converted all the government-run Madrassas into Upper primary, high school and higher secondary school

The Assam government earlier stated that the state government annually incurred Rs 500 Crore in running this Madrassa. In 2020 Repeal of the Assam Madrassa Education (Provincialisation) Act 1995 and the Assam Madrassa Education (Provincialisation of services of employees and re-organisation of Madrassa Educational Institutions) Act 2018 was passed by the state assembly."

Meanwhile, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee took to X Handle and thanked people, saying that based on people’s strength and their “unflinching support”, her party will continue to fight for everyone in this “great democratic country”.

""A section of Trinamool Congress has been involved in corruption and they did wrong but that does not mean all are corrupt,” Hakim said. He also slammed BJP for using the Enforcement Directorate and CBI against the ruling party. “A section of Trinamool did wrong and some Trinamool leaders were associated with corruption. But we are all not doing wrong. There are attempts to create false perceptions by Amit Malviya's team. Their main organization is Enforcement Directorate and CBI,” Hakim said, slamming the BJP.

“Corruption is the dirtiest thing and Mamata Banerjee does not want it,” Hakim said, adding, “No one can prove that I have ever taken a single paisa from and if proven, I will resign.”

Congress spokesperson Soumya Aich Roy said, ""After running their government for 12 years, you (Hakim) are saying that there is corruption...There is an attempt of image building ahead of elections...There are people sitting on the road, demanding jobs as school teachers. There is a need for corrective measures…”

Responding sharply, BJP chief spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya said, ""Hakim is telling this to whom- the voters or Trinamool workers? This is a court monitored probe done by ED and CBI and it has been proved in the investigation that corruption and irregularities had happened in the recruitment scam. It is Trinamool's institutional corruption. People have already understood the Trinamool Congress.”

Meanwhile, Trinamool Supremo Mamata Banerjee, wrote in her X Handle, today, ""To serve Maa - Mati Manush, the journey of Trinamool Congress began on January 1, 1998. In this journey, our main objectives have been to honour the motherland, uphold the interests of our state and to work relentlessly for protection of the democratic rights of our people...""

""I humbly honour and respect their dedication and self- sacrifices. Today the Trinamool Congress family is blessed with love and affection of one and all. It is on the strength of your unflinching support that we shall continue to fight for everyone in this great democratic country. No surrender to any evil force: in defiance of all terror we will continue our lifelong struggles for the common people.""

Amid alleged divide between old and the new generation of leaders, Trinamool leadership is trying to mend it. “In the coming election Abhishek Banerjee will fight with Mamata Banerjee as our leader and Trinamool flowers logo,” Subrata Bakshi, party’s National President, said, ruling out any such division. However, senior Trinamool leader & MP Sudip Bandopadhyay said, “Bengal remains topical nationally as Mamata Banerjee is in politics. In Mamata Banerjee’s absence, the identity of the party will be dwindling.”

“Authority of the Chief Minister is being challenged. Her directions are violated…It seems that there are layers in the administration. No one can prevent Trinamool’s defeat in the coming election,” Bhattacharya commented.

CPI-M Rajya Sabha MP Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said, “This is the last leg of the fight within Trinamool Congress before its defeat. It is their internal issue.”

Last Wednesday, New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft over copyright infringement, alleging that millions of its articles were used without consent to train chatbots and AI models, which now compete with it.

""It is certainly a very important case. It is an issue that I have spoken about in the past in the context of social media and big tech platform versus Indian creators of content...

""This is a broader issue of what is the relationship between those who scrape the internet and monetise from that scraping, versus the content that is on the internet that is copyrighted content,"" Chandrasekhar told PTI in a recent interview.

He described the case as an ""interesting"" one. ""We should all stay tuned... watch this space,"" Chandrasekhar, the Minister of State for IT and Electronics, added.

According to experts, the lawsuit opens another frontier and has wide ramifications in a fierce battle over the unauthorised use of copyrighted work to train AI models.

This is the first instance of a large US media house suing companies, which are the big names behind ChatGPT and other viral AI platforms, over copyright infringement related to its written works.

The lawsuit has been filed in the Federal District Court in Manhattan, and claims that millions of its published works were used to train chatbots that now compete with media outlets as a reliable source.

""It is not clear right now on what the balance or asymmetry of power is between those who scrape the internet and use content that is copyrighted to train their models or deliver a service vis-a-vis who actually created the content. That equation and that asymmetry is certainly bothersome, especially because of the power and the almost monopoly like power on the other side of this equation,"" the minister noted.

Chandrasekhar had also penned a post on X last week on this, where he said, ""Am going to track this as it's relevant in India too"".

""This is a very fundamental dispute that's shaping up and will answer the critical question of monetisation relationship between platforms like search, Gen AI, etc, and content creators like media, creative companies, etc,"" he wrote."

Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh also expressed his concern over the attacks on the forces and said that a delegation would soon go to Delhi to apprise the central leaders on the prevailing situation of the state.

Five Manipur Police commandos were injured in clashes with suspected Kuki militants in the state’s Tengnoupal district on Saturday and Sunday.

The injured personnel -- Diliangam Kamson, M.Priyokumar, N.Borjao, M.Sunil and Ponkhalung -- were given first aid at the Assam Rifles camp in Moreh and then brought to Regional Institute of Medical Sciences in Imphal, the official said.

Several tribal organisations alleged that many houses were burnt down by the attackers in Moreh areas since Saturday.

The Manipur Chief Minister, posting his statement on the X, said: “The unprecedented attacks against the state forces in recent times have become a serious national security threat.”

While the state and central security forces are actively engaged in maintaining control over the situation, it is also imperative for the combined security forces to adopt a robust and comprehensive approach to deal with these elements, who are relentlessly attempting to destabilise the state of Manipur, he said.

Singh said: “Joined a high level meeting in presence of Smt A Sharda Devi Ji, President BJP Manipur Pradesh, Hon’ble Ministers, Hon’ble MLAs and party karyakarta to deliberate on a stringent approach to deal with elements who are hell bent on destabilising Manipur.”

A delegation will also be going to Delhi soon to meet the central leaders in this regard, he added.

Moreh is just 4 km to the west of Myanmar’s largest border town Tamu. Moreh, which is 110 km south of Imphal, has been restive as a section of people are opposing the deployment of state forces in the area. The area had witnessed a series of violent incidents since May 3."

With the Asian Olympics Qualifying and World Qualifying tournaments around the corner, the camps will begin almost immediately after the conclusion of the senior National Championships in Jaipur on February 5.

The ad-hoc panel, headed by Wushu Association of India chief Bhupender Singh Bajwa with former hockey player MM Somaya and ex-shuttler Manjusha Kanwar being the other members, is taking all the crucial decisions after the newly-elected Sanjay Singh-led Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) was suspended by the Sports Ministry within three days of the polls.

The national camp will select medallists in 30 weight divisions across senior free-style, Greco-Roman, and women's categories from the senior Nationals in Jaipur, which are being organised by the Railway Sports Promotion Board from February 2-5.

""The camp will extend until the 2024 Paris Olympics and its primary focus would be to train the grapplers or the upcoming Olympic Qualifying tournaments.

Dwivedi retired on Sunday (December 31) after enjoying an extension of six months and BP Gopalika was appointed the new Chief Secretary. Gopalika was the Home Secretary before taking up the charge in the new position.

Dwivedi has huge experience and has efficiently handed financial matters since he was the Additional Chief Secretary in the state’s Finance department for a long duration.

“The Chief Minister was keen to retain him as the Chief Financial Advisor to utilise his experience and expertise in handling the financial affairs of the state,” sources in the state secretariat said.

Dwivedi’s predecessor Alapan Bandyopadhyay was retained by the Chief Minister’s principal advisor following his retirement as the Chief Secretary. This is not the first time the Chief Minister has retained top bureaucrat in advisory positions after their retirement.

Former Finance Minister Amit Mitra has also been retained as Chief minister’s advisor after he decided to retire from his political career due to his ailing health.

Nandini Chakravorty, a 1994-batch IAS officer, took over as West Bengal Home Secretary on Sunday from the incumbent B.P. Gopalika, who was promoted to chief secretary after H.K. Dwivedi’s retirement.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/navigating-the-trade-and-environment-nexus-a-call-for-actionable-equitable-policies/articleshow/106457874.cms,"In the complex web of international trade policies, the intersection with environmental and other considerations has become a pressing concern, particularly for the developing and emerging world. As the global community grapples with climate change, plastic waste, biodiversity loss, and pollution, the need for a balanced approach that fosters sustainable development, meaning the triumvirate of economy, equity, and ecology, is more crucial than ever.

Challenges Faced by the Developing World
For example, navigating the intricate intersection of trade and ecological concerns poses a myriad of challenges to the Global South. With limited capacities, competing priorities, and the relentless pursuit of economic development, striking a delicate balance becomes an intricate tango. The recent influx of new measures, exemplified by the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) championed by developed nations like the European Union, underscores the pressing demand for developing countries to harmonise their policies with environmental imperatives.

Adding complexity to this challenge is the undeniable reality that the developed world not only operates but increasingly shifts its polluting industries to less developed, labour-intensive countries. This trend poses additional hurdles for developing nations committed to reducing their carbon footprint, particularly as they actively attract these industries to boost foreign direct investment (FDI). Furthermore, it benefits the firms in the rich world who can reduce their environmental burden and thus not attract violation of CBAM measures. The intertwined dynamics of industrial relocation and FDI attraction create a multifaceted scenario, necessitating comprehensive strategies to navigate the intricate web of environmental concerns, economic dependencies, and the pursuit of sustainable development.

Furthermore, the Global South nations frequently find themselves ensnared in the conundrum of advancing economic growth to alleviate poverty through trade liberalisation while simultaneously grappling with non-trade issues. The apparent trade-offs between the two objectives create a formidable dilemma, especially when social and environmental regulations are perceived as potential impediments to economic progress. Furthermore, despite prolonged deliberations, international efforts often appear more as lip sympathy rather than actual and substantive help. Consequently, the Global South faces formidable obstacles in converting lofty ideals into tangible and meaningful advantages.

The Current State: Lip Service or Action?
The intersection of trade and the environment stands as a recurring focal point in international forums, where assurances of equitable treatment and a recognition of the developmental hurdles faced by emerging economies echo through the discourse.

Global South passionately advocates for fair representation and substantive involvement in shaping trade and environmental policies. However, the intricate power dynamics that characterise international negotiations persistently tip the scales against them.

Within the World Trade Organisation (WTO) regime, the principles of Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) strive to embed a developmental perspective. Similarly, Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) hinge on the concept of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) to underscore the unique challenges faced by developing nations. This principle is vital in addressing the imbalance between the rich and the poor of the world. Nevertheless, the assurance of support and consideration often falters when it comes to translating these principles into actionable policies.

The persistent calls from developing nations for extended transition periods and a steadfast commitment to principles like CBDR-RC within trade-environment discussions articulate a plea for fairness and equity. Regrettably, the outcomes on the ground remain inconclusive. Despite years of dialogue, the developmental concerns of the Global South continue to be overshadowed by the relentless pursuit of selfish economic interests by the Global North.

Moreover, in the intricate dance between promises made on the global stage and the lived experiences of nations striving for development, a disconcerting gap persists. Bridging this divide necessitates a concerted effort to move beyond rhetoric, translating noble principles into tangible actions that genuinely prioritise the developmental challenges faced by emerging economies. Until this transformation occurs, the nexus between trade and the environment and other non-trade issues will remain fraught with unfulfilled promises and unmet expectations.

Towards Equitable Policies: From Rhetoric to Action
Addressing the intricate challenges faced by the developing world requires a careful negotiation of the complex interplay between development and environmental debate. This goes beyond a mere understanding of the trade-environment dynamic and extends to the formulation of fair and equitable trade policies, ensuring sufficient policy flexibility for developing and least-developed nations.

For equitable trade policies to move beyond rhetoric, several key aspects must be addressed:

Concrete Implementation of SDT: Special and Differential Treatment must transition from a theoretical concept to a practical reality. Policymakers in developing nations, in addressing challenges posed by polluting industries, need to proactively adopt a strategic approach. Emphasizing the necessity for prioritizing special and differential treatment is crucial, especially in discussions about CBAM and its applicability to developing countries. This prioritisation should involve incorporating distinct standards and timelines tailored to developmental needs. The crux of the matter lies in actively implementing differential treatment, enabling developing nations to adeptly balance the imperative of attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) with the overarching goal of promoting environmental sustainability.

Improved technical assistance: Developing nations need not just promise but tangible support mechanisms that acknowledge their developmental challenges. For instance, transfer of technology on reasonable terms and though briefer, developing and least-developed nations to have a two-year transition period under the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies. While it supports development goals, the absence of active technical assistance may hinder achieving them.

Revitalising Trade and Environment Negotiations: The Doha Development Agenda (DDA) set the stage for trade and environment negotiations, but progress has been slow. There is an urgent need to breathe new life into these discussions, with a focus on real outcomes that align with the principles of sustainable development.

Alignment with Climate Change Initiatives: The nexus between trade and climate change is undeniable. Efforts must be made to bridge the gap between the WTO and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), fostering collaboration and information exchange.

Triple-Win Solutions: Identifying issues that offer simultaneous economic, social, and environmental progress is pivotal. The pursuit of policies that benefit all aspects of development is essential for sustainable growth.

Enhancing “Aid-for-Trade”: Greening the “Aid-for-Trade” initiative is a step towards aligning developmental needs with environmental goals. The focus should be on providing support that aids in capacity building and sustainable development outcomes.

Demand-Driven Capacity Building: Developing nations need targeted capacity-building initiatives that address their specific challenges. This may vary from geography to geography and requires not just financial resources but a sincere commitment to inclusive advancement in areas critical to their development.

Breaking the Deadlock: Moving Beyond Impasse
The existing deadlock in global efforts to create equitable trade policies demands a reassessment of prevailing strategies. Closing the enduring divide between commitments and actual implementation is essential for substantial transformation. It is imperative to recognise that the dilemmas encountered by the Global South in reconciling trade and environmental and other non-trade concerns, and considerations are not isolated problems but integral components of the broader global development agenda. As governments proceed with trade and environment discussions in the upcoming year, four key recommendations are put forth for their consideration:

First, Enhanced Participation in Negotiations: Developing countries should actively engage in trade and environment talks, ensuring strategic measures for enhancement. Advocate inclusive participation in WTO negotiations, establish dedicated working groups, and strengthen South-South cooperation for collective bargaining power.

Second, Reinforcing Developmental Frameworks: Utilise frameworks like SDT and CBDR-RC to support a developmental perspective. Integrate flexibility mechanisms in trade agreements with differentiated timelines, commitments, and frameworks for temporary exemptions, aligning trade policies with environmental and other goals. Ensure transfer of technology on reasonable terms to enable green production by incentivising the IPR holders in the rich world.

Third, Tackling Non-Tariff Barriers: Address non-tariff barriers through concerted efforts. Advocate within WTO for elimination or reduction, implement transparent guidelines for assessment, and resolve non-tariff barriers to ensure fair access and promote environmentally sustainable trade practices.

Fourth, Checking of Polluting Industries Shifting to Global South: To keep a track of polluting industries which are shifting from rich countries to poor countries and assess their impact on the host countries for being used in bargains for concessions under SDT.

The DGCA had issued 1,165 CPLs during the year ended December 31, 2022, as per the release.

It also said the number of CPLs issued in 2023 was the highest in a decade.

""The record issue of 1,622 CPLs for 2023 has surpassed the previous milestone of 1,165 licences issued in 2022, witnessing a 39.22 increase,"" the statement said.

This is the second consecutive year where the number of licences issued has witnessed a decade-high, the DGCA release said.

Besides, of the 1,622 CPLs during 2023, as much as 18.12 per cent were issued to women pilots, the release said, adding, ""India is considered to be one of the leading nations with women pilot licences.""

The significant percentage increase upholds the government's vision of women empowerment in the civil aviation sector, it stated.

An estimated 14 per cent of the workforce employed with scheduled airlines consists of women pilots, as per the release.

The issuance of 1,622 CPLs in a year comes at a time when the country's civil aviation sector is recovering at a fast pace after the coronavirus pandemic, and several major operators like Air India and IndiGo have announced placing huge orders for aircraft, the release said.

Additionally, to cater to the long time demand of small business and helicopter operators, the regulator has granted approval for a new helicopter flying training organisation to enable aspirants to undertake training and acquire commercial licences for helicopters, it said.

With this, it is expected that the helicopter industry -- largely engaged in regional connectivity services (RCS), pilgrimage, air-ambulance, among others -- will shore up in terms of crew strength by receiving an additional pool other than ex-military pilots, the statement added.

Allegations of sexual assault, harassment, gender violence, and negligence form the basis of a lawsuit filed recently in Los Angeles County Superior Court, as reported by CNN.

The lawsuit, made public on Saturday, delineates two distinct incidents involving Abdul, occurring in the early 2000s and in 2015, respectively. The complaint details the events, where Abdul accuses Lythgoe of forceful physical advances.

The first incident reportedly took place during regional auditions for “American Idol,” where Abdul asserts that Lythgoe physically restrained her, groped her, and attempted to kiss her against her will. Abdul resisted, expressing her disapproval of his behavior.

The second alleged incident transpired in 2015 during a business dinner at Lythgoe’s residence. Abdul claims Lythgoe made unwanted advances, trying to force himself on her while she was seated on a couch. Again, Abdul rebuffed his actions, clarifying her lack of interest in his advances and emphasizing the professional nature of their meeting.

Abdul refrained from reporting these incidents at the time, citing fear of potential professional repercussions. She further contends witnessing Lythgoe assaulting her assistant in another incident in 2015.

In response to these allegations, Lythgoe vehemently denies the claims, labeling them as ""false"" and ""deeply offensive"" in a statement to TMZ. He asserts his determination to counter these accusations.

Abdul’s lawsuit targets not only Lythgoe but also involves 19 Entertainment Inc., FremantleMedia North America Inc., American Idol Productions Inc., and Dance Nation Productions Inc. as co-defendants. She accuses these entities of gender violence, sexual harassment, and negligence, holding them accountable for allegedly condoning Lythgoe’s actions by failing to oversee his conduct. Abdul seeks unspecified punitive damages through the legal action.

Seeking comments from Lythgoe and the mentioned companies, CNN has reached out for their response to these allegations.

The lawsuit additionally claims that Abdul faced discriminatory treatment while working on “American Idol,” comparing her treatment unfavorably to that of her male counterparts. Allegations of constant taunting, bullying, humiliation, and harassment directed at Abdul during her tenure on the show are outlined in the complaint.

Abdul asserts that these incidents have caused severe emotional distress, anxiety, humiliation, and other physical and emotional injuries. Her legal team, represented by Douglas L. Johnson, emphasizes Abdul's determination to seek justice and stand in solidarity with other survivors.

Filed under California’s Sexual Abuse and Cover Up Accountability Act, Abdul’s lawsuit leverages provisions that allow claims of damages resulting from sexual assault outside the statute of limitations to be filed within a specified period.

The company has received a demand order for an aggregate amount of Rs 129.79 crore, including a penalty of Rs 11.8 crore and applicable interest from the office of the Principal Commissioner of CGST and Central Excise, Chennai, Eicher Motors said in a regulatory filing.

The officer has disallowed certain GST credit and raised GST demand, largely on account of the difference in GST credit mismatch between the company's GST availment and details reported by suppliers in their GST returns, it added.

Besides, the turnover difference as declared in GSTR-3B with GSTR-1 return and non-reversal of input tax credit on material returned instead of output tax liability paid by the company have also been cited as reasons.

Eicher Motors further said a demand order for Rs 70.9 lakh, including a penalty of Rs 3.2 lakh, has been served by the Office of Excise And Taxation Officer cum State Tax Officer, Punjab over ""turnover difference as declared in GSTR-3B, GSTR-1 and GSTR-9 for FY 2017-18"".

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/ketone-supplements-may-impact-performance-of-athletes-on-field/articleshow/106457218.cms,"New Delhi: Ketone supplements, intended to boost athletic performance, may actually reduce it, as evidenced by slower cycling speeds in athletes, a study suggests. The research, published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, analysed contradictory findings related to the effectiveness of ketone supplements, which have gained popularity among athletes seeking a competitive advantage.

Some previously published studies had shown the supplements improve performance, while others have reported they had no effect or even worsened performance, the researchers said.

Natural ketones can serve as fuels for the brain and muscles. A ketogenic diet - characterised by very low carbohydrate and typically high fat intake - causes the body to produce more organic ketone compounds and increase their use for energy, they said.

""One of the main perceived benefits is that ketones may serve as an alternative fuel source during exercise or potentially alter the utilisation of other major fuel such as carbohydrates and fats, and in turn enhance endurance capacity,"" said Martin Gibala, a professor at McMaster University in the UK.

""But our findings suggest that is not the case,"" Gibala said.

The researchers recruited well-trained endurance athletes who cycled five or more hours per week, selecting them because their athletic performance is consistent from day to day.

The experiment was conducted in a lab but simulated race conditions and the participants prepared as they normally would for a cycling competition.

Each participant completed two trials that differed only in the drink provided before they completed a 20-minute cycling time trial that closely predicts 40-km race performance.

The drinks contained either a ketone supplement or a similar-tasting placebo.

The research was structured as a double-blind study, meaning neither the researchers nor the athletes knew whether the ketone supplement or the placebo was provided.

""The main observation from this study was that the speed that the cyclists could sustain during the test was lower after drinking the ketone supplement compared to the placebo,"" said Devin McCarthy, lead author of the study and graduate student at McMaster.

Researchers said the findings align with their previous work which found ketone supplements increased cardiorespiratory stress during exercise.

They are currently investigating responses to varying doses of the supplements at different exercise intensities to better understand how ketones may affect performance, and the potential underlying mechanisms."

As the skies sparkled with New Year's fireworks globally, disquieting events marked the commencement. From Gaza, rockets launched towards Israel at midnight prompted defensive measures, compelling Israeli revelers to seek refuge. In response, Israel's retaliatory actions resulted in casualties and extensive devastation in Gaza, worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis.

Simultaneously, Ukraine grappled with escalating tensions, with authorities successfully thwarting numerous Russian drones, fueling fears amid escalating conflicts with Russian forces. President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed a forceful reply, while Russian President Vladimir Putin hinted at escalated offensives, heightening concerns of a spiraling situation.

Meanwhile, Japan was rocked by a powerful earthquake on New Year's Day, registering a magnitude of 7.6, triggering tsunami alerts. The seismic activity caused widespread damage, igniting fires and compelling coastal residents to evacuate to higher ground, bracing for potential tsunami surges.

Amid the chaos, customary New Year celebrations unfolded worldwide. Festivities in Sydney kicked off with exuberance, while New York City witnessed the iconic ball drop in Times Square. However, incidents disrupted merrymaking elsewhere, including injuries from fireworks in Italy, clashes leading to arrests in Berlin, and injured police officers amidst revelry.

In the midst of these global events, Pope Francis extended prayers for conflict victims globally, urging contemplation on the toll of armed conflicts and climate-driven disasters that marred 2023, recorded as the hottest year on record.

As 2024 progresses, elections loom in several nations, including pivotal ones in Russia, Britain, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, Venezuela, and the United States. The latter anticipates a contentious presidential contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, stirring both concern and anticipation among supporters on either side.

The world embarks on 2024 amidst a complex tapestry of challenges, aspirations, and uncertainties, where geopolitical tensions, environmental crises, and political transitions shape the global narrative.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/rbi-simplifies-reactivation-of-dormant-accounts-tightens-norms-to-curb-frauds/articleshow/106457652.cms,"The Reserve Bank of India has eased the process to reactivate the dormant accounts and at the same time tightened norms to ensure that frauds are limited in the inoperative accounts where funds remain unclaimed.

The central bank said that activation of such accounts can simply be done by re-submission of know your customer (KYC) details across branches including non-home branches. The process can also be done through video-customer identification process (V-CIP) on account holders' request, if the facility is being provided by the bank.

Banks are not allowed to charge a fee for activation of inoperative accounts. There should also not be any penal charge for non-maintenance of minimum balances in any account that is classified as inoperative.

Banks are liable to pay irrespective of the fact that the account is in operation or not.

RBI told banks to conduct annual reviews in respect of accounts, where there are no customer induced transactions for more than a year.

""The segregation of inoperative accounts is required to be done to reduce the risk of frauds. The transactions in inoperative accounts, which have been reactivated, shall be monitored regularly, for at least six months, at higher levels without the knowledge and notice of the customers and the dealing staff,"" RBI said.

The revised instructions will be effective from April 1. All commercial banks including regional rural banks and all co-operative banks would need to follow this.

RBI said that in cases where there is no explicit mandate to renew the term deposit, the banks should review such accounts if the customers have not withdrawn the proceeds after maturity or transferred these to their savings/current account in order to prevent such deposits from becoming unclaimed.

If there are no operations in accounts/deposits for a year, banks would need to inform the account holders. ""For the purpose of classifying an account as ‘inoperative’, only customer induced transactions and not bank induced transactions shall be considered,"" RBI said.

It said that if communication from banks elicit no response, its banks' duty to undertake an enquiry to find out the whereabouts of account holder or his/her nominee/legal heirs in case the account holder is deceased.

The regulator has also underscored a need to treat zero-balance accounts a little differently. Banks open zero balance accounts for beneficiaries of central and state government schemes and for students who receive scholarships.

""The banks shall, based on the purpose of opening of the account, segregate the aforementioned accounts in their CBS, so that the stipulation of ‘inoperative’ account is not applicable to these accounts due to their non-operation for a period of more than two years,"" RBI said."

The Nifty50 continues to trade at 19.8 times its 1-year forward P/E based on the consensus earnings. On a 10-year basis, the index is still trading 10% above its 10-year mean valuation, says HSBC Mutual Fund.

Valuations in the midcap and smallcap space are much more elevated. They are trading 33% above their 10-year mean valuations.

“We would, therefore, caution against high return expectations. However, we remain constructive on Indian equities supported by the more robust medium-term growth outlook,” the fund house said. Sectors/Themes To Play

The fund house expects India’s manufacturing sector to maintain a strong medium-term growth trajectory as the underlying drivers continue to strengthen.

Localisation thrust and global supply chain re-adjustments are driving capacity addition in manufacturing across verticals, it said. It also expects the government’s thrust on infrastructure to continue.

“Rising power demand, buoyant capital markets and need to reduce carbon footprint are likely to drive growth in private investments into renewable energy,” the fund house said.

The government’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme is helping manufacturing capacity in areas like renewable energy, electronics and other new technology areas.

The other sector that is expected to do well according to the fund house is real estate.

The sector remains another strong medium-term growth driver having weathered the impact of higher interest rates.

With a pickup in the investment cycle, credit growth is expected to get further support in 2024.

“We believe the banking system is now well prepared to support this as asset quality is now strong and has continued to improve,” the fund house said.

Finally, it also expects an improvement in consumption once the impact of high inflation fades and real income starts to grow again.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/nobel-laureate-dr-muhammad-yunus-sentenced-to-six-months-in-jail-by-bangladesh-court/articleshow/106456744.cms,"Bangladesh's Nobel laureate economist Dr Muhammad Yunus was on Monday sentenced to six months in jail by a court for violating the labour laws, a verdict termed as ""politically motivated"" by his supporters ahead of the January 7 general elections. The 83-year-old economist, who was present in court, sought bail after the ruling, which Third Labour Court Judge Sheikh Merina Sultana granted immediately for a month in exchange for a Taka 5,000 (USD 45) bond. The court gave the defence 30 days to appeal.

Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his anti-poverty campaign, earning Bangladesh the reputation of being the home of microcredit through his Grameen Bank, which he founded in 1983.

Yunus and three of his colleagues in Grameen Telecom-- one of the firms he founded-- were accused of violating labour laws when they failed to create a workers' welfare fund in the company.

Judge Sultana ordered Yunus to serve six months of simple or non-rigorous imprisonment for violating the law as the Grameen Telecom chairman, along with three other executives of the social business company.

""The allegation of violating the Labour Law against him has been proved. It appears that the allegation has not been barred by limitation (either),"" the judge said, pronouncing the judgment while Yunus was in the dock.

She also slapped a Taka 25,000 fine (USD 227.82) on each of them, adding that they would have to serve 10 more days in jail in case of a default.

Under the law, all four can appeal against the verdict in the High Court.

The verdict comes just days ahead of the January 7 general election in Bangladesh.

Describing the judgment as ""politically motivated"", his supporters said the charges were filed to harass him.

Last month, after a court appearance for the hearing, Yunus rejected claims of profiting from Grameen Telecom or any of the more than 50 social business firms he founded in Bangladesh. ""They were not for my personal benefit,"" he told reporters.

Grameen Telecom owns 34 per cent of Bangladesh's largest mobile phone company, Grameenphone.

Yunus' lawyers called the case ""meritless, false and ill-motivated"" and claimed it was only aimed to harass and humiliate Yunus before the global community.

The Nobel laureate is also facing a series of charges relating to labour law and misappropriation of money.

The economist was on a protracted row with the incumbent government due to obscure reasons. The Sheikh Hasina-led administration began a series of investigations against him after coming to power in 2008.

Bangladesh authorities began a review of the statutory Grameen Bank's activities in 2011 and fired Yunus as its founding managing director on charges of violating the government retirement regulations.

Many people believe that Hasina became enraged when Yunus announced he would form a political party in 2007 when the country was run by a military-backed government, and she was in prison.

However, Yunus did not follow through on the plan but criticised politicians in the country, alleging they were only interested in making money.

Hasina's government began a review of the Grameen Bank's activities in 2011 and fired Yunus as its founding managing director on charges of violating government retirement regulations.

He was put on trial in 2013 on charges of receiving money without government permission, including his Nobel Prize award and royalties from a book.

Hasina called Yunus a ""bloodsucker"" and accused him of using force and other means to recover loans from poor rural women as head of Grameen Bank.

He was later granted bail after his court appearance.

After his prolonged efforts to settle disputes with the government, Yunus blasted the government for paving the way for the ""destruction"" of the pioneering micro-lending bank he founded.

In August 2023, 18 former Grameen Telecom workers filed a case against Yunus, accusing him of siphoning off their job benefits.

Separately, Yunus went on trial in August 2022 on charges of violating labour laws.

The economist and 13 others were also named in a case brought by the Anti-Corruption Commission accusing them of embezzling funds from Grameen Telecom.

In August last year, more than 170 global leaders and Nobel laureates sent an open letter to Prime Minister Hasina urging her to suspend legal proceedings against Yunus.

The signatories included former US President Barack Obama, former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and more than 100 Nobel laureates.

These papers, set for public disclosure this week, have notably mentioned Clinton, prompting inquiries into his involvement in the Epstein saga.

The documents, pivotal in legal disputes involving Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's associate, and Virginia Giuffre, bring to light allegations of Maxwell facilitating sexual abuse. Giuffre's claims of being directed by Epstein and Maxwell to engage in sexual encounters with high-profile individuals, including Prince Andrew of Britain, have sparked interest in Clinton's association.

Judge Loretta Preska's decision to reveal these long-secret papers has heightened anticipation, as they may unveil the identities of over 150 individuals referred to as ""John and Jane Does.""

While Clinton's name recurs more than fifty times in the papers, Giuffre hasn't accused the 77-year-old former president of any wrongdoing. Her account mentions meeting Clinton on Epstein's private Caribbean island but does not implicate him in illegal activities.

Despite these repeated references to Clinton, the documents are not anticipated to directly incriminate him. Instead, his frequent appearances within the papers seem aimed at compelling his testimony against Epstein, the deceased sex offender, and Maxwell, his former associate.

Both Maxwell and Giuffre have made attempts involving Clinton to push Epstein to disclose information in 2016, as Epstein repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment rights during a deposition in the lawsuit.

Numerous individuals previously connected to Epstein or associated with his abhorrent sex-trafficking network have already been identified within these documents.

Regarding his ties with Epstein, Clinton, who was photographed with Epstein and traveled on his private jet multiple times, has staunchly denied any inappropriate connections with sex offenders. However, the recurring mentions of his name within these confidential papers have spurred questions and further scrutiny into his association with the Epstein case.

""This decision has been made after receiving the approval of the Empowered Group of Secretaries (EGoS),"" the ministry said in a release.

As part of the amendments to the scheme, the incentive will be applicable for a total of five consecutive financial years, which commence from the FY24.

""The disbursement of the incentive will take place in the following financial year 2024-25. The scheme also specifies that an approved applicant will be eligible for benefits for five consecutive financial years, but not beyond the financial year ending on March 31, 2028,"" the government explained.

In other words, the extension of the five-year scheme, originally in place from 2022-23 to 2026-27, will be active until 2027-28.

Moreover, the government has also said that if an approved company fails to meet the threshold for an increase in Determined Sales Value over the first year's threshold, it will not receive any incentive for that year.

""However, it will still be eligible for benefits in the next year if it meets the threshold calculated on the basis of a 10 per cent YoY growth over the first year's threshold,"" it said.

As per the government, this provision ensures a level playing field for all approved companies and safeguards those who preferred to front-load their investments.

The table showing the incentive outlay has also been modified as part of the amendment; the indicative incentive totals Rs. 25,938 crore.

The PLI-Auto Scheme offers financial incentives to encourage investments in the automotive manufacturing value chain and to increase domestic production of Advanced Automotive Technology (AAT) products.

The two components of the programme are Component Champions, which produces high-end, high-tech components, and Champion OEM, which produces electric or hydrogen-powered vehicles.

The heavy industries ministry announced on November 9, 2021, the 19 AAT vehicle categories and 103 AAT component categories fall under the scope of the scheme.

These parts are either cutting-edge or high-tech automotive parts, or they are those for which India lacks an Indian supply chain. According to the statement, India will be able to grow its proportion of the global supply chains for advanced technology and automobiles thanks to this scheme.

Mohapatra said 2023 was the second warmest year since 1901 as the annual mean air temperature for the country was 0.65 degree Celsius above normal. The warmest year since 1901 was 2016 when the annual mean air temperature for the country was 0.710 degrees celsius above normal.

Mohapatra said most parts of the country were expected to witness relatively warmer mornings with central and northwestern parts set to experience cooler days as the weather office has forecast below normal monthly maximum temperatures over the region.

However, south peninsular and north-east India could experience warmer days as above normal monthly maximum temperatures were expected to prevail over the region in January.

It has also forecast dense to very dense fog over some parts of the plains of northwest India and East India, extending into parts of Bangladesh, and gradually decreasing thereafter.

The weather office also said that cold day to severe cold day conditions were likely to continue over some parts of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and north Rajasthan during next two days and decrease thereafter.

Mohapatra said the country as a whole, at 25.5 mm, received 60 per cent excess rains in December against the normal of 15.9 mm for the month.

South peninsular regions received 72.2 mm rainfall in December, which was 126 per cent excess than the normal 32 mm for the month, he said.

The rainfall was 191 per cent more in Central India, which received 14.8 mm rains against the normal of 5.1 mm for December.

However, in wheat growing northwest India, the rainfall was 65 per cent deficit than the normal rains of 18.9 mm, Mohapatra said.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/indias-economy-burns-bright-but-watch-out-for-these-4-risks-in-2024/articleshow/106456662.cms,"Amid gloomy global prospects, India's economy is upbeat and is expected to remain the world's fastest-growing major economy in 2024 for the third straight year. Inflation is moderating, demand is growing and economic activity is strengthening. The finance ministry expects the GDP growth rate in 2023-24 to ""comfortably"" exceed its forecast of 6.5 per cent following the blockbuster data for July-September.

On the inflation front, the ministry has stated that with the stable downward movement in core inflation and continuing deflation in fuel inflation, the headline inflation outlook is on a declining trend, notwithstanding temporary disruptions from food prices. The RBI has projected inflation to average at 5.4 per cent in FY24. High-frequency indicators including vehicle sales and power consumption, for October and November 2023 reflect robust economic activity in the third quarter of FY24, which is likely to continue in the fourth quarter as well, the Finance Ministry said.

India recorded a GDP expansion of 6.1 per cent in the March quarter. The growth moved up to 7.8 per cent in the June quarter and was 7.6 per cent in the September quarter. For the first six months of this fiscal, the growth was 7.7 per cent.

Yet, there are risks to the economic growth and stability in 2024, mainly emanating from outside the country. Below are four factors that can impede growth and threaten stability in 2024.

A change of government
In the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the ruling BJP is widely expected to come back to power and continue with its economic agenda. However, if a coalition government is formed by the opposition parties, there are chances it may not bode well for the economy. Coalition governments in themselves are not bad for the economy; they could even be better given the need for a wide consensus in a coalition government on economic matters and thus fewer chances of radical measures that upset the economy.

But in the current circumstances, a possible threat can emerge from policy rupture, especially given the thrust of the opposition parties on populist and welfare politics as against the aggressive growth agenda pursued by the incumbent government. A win for the incumbent government will be seen as a vote for the government's policies which will give the government more confidence to stick to its agenda.

However, a coalition government could be just a temporary shock to the economy in case of a radical change in the policies and agendas.

Worsening of geopolitical crises
The Israel-Palestine war broke out last year while the Russia-Ukraine war was still lingering on. Either of these two geopolitical crises can worsen, especially with the growing chances of the Israel war spilling over as the Houthi rebels of Yemen and Hezbollah militant group based in Lebanon acting more aggressively. Already, the Iran-backed Houthis are striking at naval transport in the Red Sea, a vital shipping route for the world.

Maersk, one of the world's major cargo shippers, said on Sunday it was pausing all sailing through the Red Sea for 48 hours after the Houthis attacked a Maersk container vessel with missiles and small boats.

The Red Sea is the entry point for ships using the Suez Canal, which handles about 12% of global trade and vital for the movement of goods between Asia and Europe. A wider war erupting in the region will jeopardise supply chains once again after the disruptions caused by the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, spiking commodity prices, including of oil.

That will be bad for India's fiscal stability as the country relies largely on imports for its energy needs. A wider war will also create pressures on food supply. Higher oil and food prices might spike India's inflation, which now seems to be calming down. The RBI is expected to cut interest rates in the second half of the year mainly due to a lowering inflation. But a flared-up war might force its hand to hike rates. It had paused its rate-hike cycle in April last year. Higher rates will impede economic growth.

Food supply shocks
Food inflation remained at an elevated level throughout the year after touching a low of 2.96 per cent in May. In November, it stood at 8.7 per cent.

The agriculture ministry has come out with its initial estimates which do not give a positive picture due to the projection of a likely slight drop in the 2023 kharif food grain output at 148.56 million tonnes as against 155.7 million tonnes in the year-ago period due to ""below average"" rainfall in the four-month (June-September) monsoon season amid strengthening of El Nino conditions. However, ministry officials are of the view that the kharif food grain production estimates will be revised positively by the time the fourth and final estimates are prepared.

Last year too, the country faced erratic weather conditions and yet could achieve a record food grain production of 329.68 million tonnes in the 2022-23 crop year (July-June) as per the ministry's final estimates. However, a sudden temperature rise sparked concern about last year's wheat output leading to an export ban in May 2022 to check high domestic prices.

The fact remains that India's foodgrain output remains vulnerable to shocks.

In the minutes of the latest MPC meeting, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das held reservations about inflation, which has receded from highs, but remains volatile. ""The overall inflation outlook is expected to be clouded by volatile and uncertain food prices and intermittent weather shocks. In the immediate months of November and December, a resurgence of vegetable price inflation is likely to push up food and headline inflation,"" Das said.

In the midst of uncertainties, monetary policy has to remain ""actively disinflationary"" to ensure a durable alignment of headline inflation to the target rate of 4% while supporting growth, Das has said.

Foodgrain and vegetable supply shocks can push inflation up, since food inflation accounts for nearly half of the overall consumer price basket. The RBI keeps a keen eye on inflation and any spike will make it averse to cutting rates or, in a worse case, even hike rates once again.

The RBI, in its December bulletin, stated that the real-time inflation is adversely impacting discretionary consumer spending. This, in turn, is impeding the overall growth of manufacturing companies, including their capital expenditure, it said. In its December policy meeting, the central bank left its inflation forecast for this fiscal year unchanged at 5.4 per cent, despite food price rise concerns, uncertainty around crude costs even amidst a recent slump and chances of domestic growth momentum creating demand pressure on inflation.

The pandemic scare
The recent surge in Covid cases and the prevalence of subvariant JN.1 have triggered fears of the return of the pandemic days even though experts say the new subvariant is high in transmission but less virulent. India has logged 841 new cases of Covid, the highest in 227 days, while the number of active cases of the infection have been recorded at 4,309, the health ministry said on Sunday.

The unpredictability of new Covid variants always looms as a threat. The economic devastation wreaked by the pandemic that brought the world to a halt for nearly two years will remain a concern even though by now most experts do not consider the possibility of such a large-scale disruption happening again even as new Covid strains come and go. Yet, another possible outbreak will remain a risk for years to come.

Finally, at present, it appears the biggest possible risk to India's economy in 2024 is global geopolitical flashpoints, mainly the Israel war spilling over and drawing in more actors. But given the robustness of India's economy, India is expected to be well-poised to tackle such a risk.

The Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas (CAQM), a statutory body responsible for formulating strategies to combat pollution in the region, met on January 1 following improvement in air quality.

The sub-committee of CAQM revoked the Stage-III of GRAP in view of the forecasts by the IMD/IITM for meteorological conditions and air quality index of Delhi, officials said.

According to the forecast, the AQI of Delhi has been progressively improving and has been recorded as 346 at 4:O0 PM which is about 55 AQI points below the threshold for invoking the GRAP Stage-III actions (Delhi AQI 401-450) and there is a likelihood of sustaining the improvement in AQI.

Furthermore, the forecast does not indicate any deterioration further and there is a likelihood of the AQI improving while remaining in Very Poor/Poor category in next few days, an official statement by the CAQM said.

However, actions under Stage-I to Stage-II of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) shall remain invoked and be implemented, monitored and reviewed by all agencies concerned in the entire NCR, it added.

The commission has asked agencies to keep strict vigil and especially intensify measures under Stage-I and II of GRAP in order to obviate the implementation of Stage-III of GITAP actions.

The C and D project sites and industrial units that have been issued specific closure orders on account of violations/ non-compliances of various statutory directions, rules, and guidelines will not be allowed to resume their operations without any specific order to this effect from the Commission.

The CAQM invoked actions under GRAP Stage-III last year on December 22 amid deteriorating air quality in Delhi as the AQI level slipped into the 'Severe' category for several days.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/anticipating-springs-arrival-mark-your-calendar-for-the-first-day-of-spring-in-2024/articleshow/106456770.cms,"Winter has arrived some time back and the cold winds have started to make people long for the spring. The year 2023 has been marked by some considerable transitions in weather conditions such as the shift from rainfall to drought. It has been a year of “weather weirding”.

The warmer an atmosphere is, the more it permits the atmosphere to hold onto a greater amount of water and aggravate events of precipitation such as snow or rainfall.

According to reports, we may not witness much snow as we are experiencing El Niño, which indicates that heavy snow and cold periods are not likely to occur till January.

Coming to spring, let's know more about what spring has in store for us in 2024
First day of spring, 2024
The first day of spring in the northern hemisphere will fall on March 19, 2024, marking the beginning of the vernal equinox.

Every year comes with two solstices and two equinoxes dictating the seasons. The vernal equinox happens when we witness a transition from winter to spring, and the autumnal equinox marks a transition from summer to fall in the Northern Hemisphere.

In the Southern and Northern Hemispheres, the equinoxes have the opposite dates – the autumnal equinox in the Southern Hemisphere and the vernal equinox of March in the Northern Hemisphere and the other way round.

As per National Geographic, equinoxes occur when the subsolar point of the Earth ( at the time of the sun rays falling perpendicular to the surface of the Earth) is passing through the Equator. Post the March vernal equinox, the Northern Hemisphere leans towards the sun, till the time of the June solstice when it shifts towards the South.

Spring months of 2024
Spring is from March end to mid-June, summer solstice.

Is spring arriving early in 2024?
It was predicted by Punxsutawney Phil that winter would last longer this year. He forecasted this after seeing his shadow on Groundhog Day.

However, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there’s no estimated ability for Phil. The groundhog has been correct only around 40% of the time.

An American tradition, Groundhog Day dates back to the year 1887, originating in the Candlemas European celebration, which is the interval between the time of the winter solstice and the spring equinox.

As per the seasonal temperature outlook by NOAA, the northernmost states will be observing temperatures above the normal in February, March, and April, especially in the Pacific Northwest and New England. The majority of Texas will be witnessing temperatures under the average.

Because of El Niño, there can be warm weather conditions. El Niño is a natural climate trend making temperatures soar.

Dates for four seasons in 2024
March 19, 2024: First day of spring
June 20, 2024: First day of summer
Sept. 22, 2024: First day of fall
Dec. 21, 2024: First day of winter

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/they-dont-care-ex-australia-skipper-steve-waugh-lambasts-icc-and-south-africa-for-ignoring-test-cricket/articleshow/106456616.cms,"One of the finest cricketers of all time and legendary Australia skipper Steve Waugh has vehemenly criticized the International Cricket Council (ICC) and other top cricket boards, including the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), for not giving importance to the ultimate form of cricket, Test cricket. He also slammed Cricket South Africa (CSA) for naming a depleted red-ball squad for the upcoming tour of New Zealand, prioritising its T20 league over the longest format.

For their two-Test series against New Zealand next month, Cricket South Africa (CSA) have announced a second-string Test squad that includes seven uncapped players, including a new captain.

The obvious reason behind this development is that the top South African cricketers are contracted to play in the second season of the SA20, the T20 league, which was launched by CSA and Indian Premier League investors. And the Test Tour clashes with the league. Hence, T20 cricket has been given priority over Tests.

According to a CSA ruling, players who are contracted to SA20 franchises are not eligible for selection for the Tests.

""Obviously, they don't care. It's going to happen if the South African cricket board are any indication of the future, keeping their best players at home,"" Waugh told the Sydney Morning Hearld.

""If I was New Zealand, I wouldn't even play the series. I don't know why they're even playing. Why would you when it shows a lack of respect for New Zealand cricket?""

Earlier, Waugh also shared his thoughts on the issue on Instagram.

""Is this a defining moment in the death of Test cricket? Surely the ICC along (with) the cricket boards of India, England and Australia must step in to protect the purest form of the game.

""History and tradition must count for something. If we stand by and allow profits to be the defining criteria, the legacy of (Sir Don) Bradman, (WG) Grace and (Sir Garfield) Sobers will be irrelevant,"" he wrote.

It's not the first time South Africa has prioritised its domestic T20 league over international cricket. Last year, they forfeited an ODI series in Australia to have their best players feature in that league.

""If the ICC or someone doesn't step in shortly then Test cricket doesn't become Test cricket because you're not testing yourself against the best players.

""I understand why players don't come. They're not getting paid properly.

""I don't understand why ICC or the top countries, who are making a lot of money, don't just have a regulation set fee for Test matches which is a premium, so people are incentivised to play Test cricket.

""Otherwise, they just play T10 or T20. The public are the ones who are going to suffers because it's not the full side playing, so it's not Test cricket,"" Waugh said.

With neither Pakistan nor the West Indies sending their full-strength teams to Australia for the Test series, Waugh fears the trend will continue.

""It's pretty obvious what the problem is. The West Indies aren't sending their full-strength side (to Australia this summer). They haven't picked a full-strength Test team for a couple of years now.

""Someone like Nicholas Pooran is really a Test batsman who doesn't play Test cricket. Jason Holder, probably their best player, is not playing now. Even Pakistan didn't send a full side (to Australia),"" he added.

In an exclusive interview with PTI, the CJI also spoke candidly about the five-judge constitution bench verdict refusing to legalise same sex marriages and said the outcome of a case is never personal to a judge.

The 50th Chief Justice of India, however, acknowledged the ""long and hard battle"" queer couples fought for realisation of their rights.

On October 17, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court refused to grant legal recognition to same-sex marriage but recognised equal rights for queer people and their protection.

""Once you decide a case you kind of distance yourself from the outcome. Outcomes are never personal to us as a judge. I never have any regrets. Yes, I have been in a majority in many cases and minority in many cases. But the important part of the life of a judge is never to associate yourself with a cause. Having decided a case, I leave it at that,"" he said.

On the Supreme Court verdict on Article 370 and its criticism, he said, the judges speak their mind through their judgement which becomes a public property after the pronouncement and people in a free society can always make their opinion about it.

""So far as we are concerned we decide according to the Constitution and the law. I don't think it will be appropriate for me either to respond to the criticism or mount a defence to my judgement. What we have said in my judgement is reflected in the reason present in the signed judgement and I must leave it at that,"" the CJI said. PTI SJK ADS MNL MNR SJK SK SK SK

Three days after the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) held its polls, the ministry suspended the sports body citing several violations of rules on December 24.

On the request of the government, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) then formed a three-member panel, headed by Bhupender Singh Bajwa, to manage the day-to-day affairs of the body.

The other members of the committee are former hockey player M M Somaya and ex-shuttler Manjusha Kanwar.

The ad-hoc panel announced that it will host the senior national championships in Jaipur from February 2-5.

Sanjay, though, remained combative and said they will not co-operate with the ad-hoc panel and will organise the Nationals.

""We got elected democratically. The Returning Officer had signed the papers, how do they ignore that. We do not recognise this ad-hoc panel,"" Sanjay told PTI.

Asked how will they organise they Nationals, he said, ""We do not recognise this suspension. The WFI is working smoothly, we are on the job.""

""How will they (ad-hoc panel) organise Nationals if our state associations will not send the teams. We will organise our National Championship soon. We are soon calling the Executive Committee meeting. The notice of the EC meeting will be sent in a day or two and we will have the Nationals organised before they do it.""

If the WFI goes on to organise its own Nationals the crisis will take a turn for the worst.

""We had sent our explanation to the ministry that we have not flouted any rules. We are still awaiting a reply. We will wait for a day or two. If they do not want to engage with us, we are not also not interested then.

""Our federation does not recognise this suspension.""

Indian wrestling has witnessed unprecedented power struggle in the last one year. In protest against Sanjay, who is a close aide of sexual harassment accused Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, becoming WFI president Bajrang Punia returned his Padma Shri and Vinesh Phogat returned her Arjuna Award and Khel Ratna.

Sakshi Malik had quit wrestling the day Sanjay won the WFI president's election.

As per industry estimates about 4.1 million passenger vehicles were sold in the local market in the last calendar year, which is an increase of around 8.2% over 3.79 million units sold in the same period the year before.

Carmakers reporter a growth of 4.4% to dispatch 287,904 units from factories to dealerships last month, highest-ever reported for the month of December, historically.

Shashank Srivastava, senior executive officer (marketing and sales) at the country’s largest carmaker said last year was a “phenomenal year” for the industry with sales breaching the best-ever mark for every month through December. “Sales were driven by a strong increase in demand for SUVs, which now accounts for nearly half of all vehicles sold in the domestic market”, Srivastava informed.

Maruti Suzuki - which registered cumulative sales (domestic and exports) of more than 2 million units for the first time in 2023 - has a share of over 20% in this fast-evolving segment.

Shailesh Chandra, Managing Director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility said, “The PV industry is expected to (have) posted its highest ever sales in the calendar year 2023 (CY23), crossing the significant 4 million mark, supported by a strong supply situation, new nameplates launched in the SUV segment, and a robust demand during the longer festive period. Coming off a high base, the industry recorded a single digit growth overall with the key highlight of this moderate rise being the sharp growth registered in emission-friendly product categories. Both EV and CNG segments posted growth greater than 90% and 25% respectively, signaling a growing preference for green and smart technologies by Indian customers.”

Overall, carmakers expect demand momentum in the market to remain healthy and sales to go up in single-digits, on a high base, in 2024. Srivastava added, “The economy is expected to continue to grow. (Car sales) volumes will be high, but the growth rate is expected to come down because of the high base.”

Yuichi Murata, Director (Marketing and Sales), Cars India, too is optimistic, “With strong sales momentum and growing market potential, backed by a robust business plan, we look forward to usher in 2024 with tremendous positivity and optimism.”

Honda Cars India sold 7,902 units last month, an increase of 12% over Dec 2022. Meanwhile, at Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) sales last month went up by 24% to 35,171 units.

For the full calendar year, Japanese auto major Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) too reported best-ever domestic sales of 221,356 units. At MG Motor India, retails grew 18% to 56,902 units in the same period.

In the two-wheeler segment, sales remained healthy last month. Chennai-based grew volumes by a third to sell 214,988 units in the local market in December. Sales of commercial vehicles remained subdued, declining by 1% at market leader Tata Motors to 32,668 units. “Going forward, we expect demand to improve in Q4FY24 across most segments of the CV industry due to the Government’s continuing thrust on infrastructure development, the promising growth outlook of the economy and our demand-pull initiatives”, Girish Wagh, executive director at Tata Motors said.

In the farm equipment segment too, retails slowed down due to seasonal factors. Mahindra Tractors sold 18,028 tractors last month, which is a decline of 17% over the year-ago period. Hemant Sikka, President (FES), M&M, said, “Retail momentum slowed down on account of tapering of agricultural activities, which is the norm in the month of December. Announcement of higher horticulture production and continued Government support to the agri sector are expected to support tractor demand.”"

Kelce and his teammates secured a remarkable 25-17 victory, claiming the prestigious title of AFC West Champions for an unprecedented eighth consecutive year.

Swift, amongst the fervent crowd, passionately cheered on her partner Kelce alongside the families of Chiefs players, notably sharing moments with the tight end's mother, Donna, from their customary suite at the stadium.

Sporting a vintage white and black Chiefs jacket paired with a black shirt, Swift donned her signature red lipstick, drawing attention from enthusiastic fans. Notably, Kelce, arriving separately, was spotted wearing the same distinctive Chiefs jacket previously seen during his December 25 game.

This New Year's Eve appearance marked Swift's fifth game-day attendance following her return from the South American leg of her Eras Tour. Previously, she was seen on December 25 donning a Santa hat embellished with Kelce's jersey number, showing her consistent support.

Since publicly acknowledging their relationship in September, Swift has attended nearly half of Kelce's games, emphasizing her commitment to supporting her beau. Despite the Chiefs' loss on Christmas Day, where some attributed the defeat to Swift's presence, the couple demonstrated unity during the holiday season, spending quality time with their respective families.

During the holiday, Swift's parents, Scott and Andrea, were observed engaging with Kelce's father in the stands and sharing moments at Travis' residence. Reflecting on this occasion, a source conveyed to the Daily Mail that witnessing their families unite on such a special day was an extraordinary gift for Taylor, marking a profoundly meaningful holiday for her.

However, Donna Kelce, busy supporting her son Jason, who plays for the Philadelphia Eagles, wasn't present at the family gathering. Despite Swift bonding extensively with Travis' parents, there hasn't been an opportunity for her to meet Kelce's brother, his wife Kylie, or their three young children: Wyatt (3), Elliotte (2), and the youngest, Bennett, who is nearly a year old.

Taylor Swift's continual support for Travis Kelce underscores their strong bond, evident through her active involvement in his professional and personal life, despite some attributing football results to her presence. As their relationship evolves, Swift remains engaged in fostering connections with Kelce's loved ones, cherishing every moment shared amidst their busy schedules.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/dot-readying-over-30-rules-based-on-new-telecom-act/articleshow/106429411.cms,"New Delhi: The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is working on more than 30 rules based on the newly enacted Telecommunications Act for implementation in the coming months. As per officials aware of the matter, the rules will be related to spectrum allotment, interception of calls, collection of biometric data, etc., for which the processes need to be defined.

“We are already working on the rules. The intent is to notify the rules in a few months,” an official told ET.

The rules will define for administrative allocation to services like satellite communication, a lawful interception mechanism for carriers and the conditions for spectrum trading, sharing and surrender, among other things.

Another official said while the department is rushing to place the rules in Parliament in the budget session, if that does not happen, it will be done after the Lok Sabha elections. The DoT has yet to take a call on doing stakeholder consultations on the proposed rules.

“The Act has been notified after a wide stakeholder consultation and most of the concerned people/industry are aware of the finer details. The rules are defined for implementation of the Act, so we will see if another consultation is needed or not,” said the official.

Since the rules will be placed on the floor of the House, it needs to be seen if any member of Parliament raises objections. The Bill was passed when a majority of the opposition MPs were under suspension.

With the notification of the new Act, the three old laws — the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933, and the Telegraph Wires (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1950 — have been repealed. It means that virtually every rule governing the telecom sector needs to be defined afresh.

As per an industry executive, it needs to be seen what modalities are defined for the administrative allocation of satellite spectrum. “We have to see what charges need to be paid for satellite spectrum and if the DoT will ask the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) for pricing and other modalities, etc.,” said the executive.

As per government officials, spectrum allotted administratively for satellite services is meant only for point-to-point connection and not for direct transmission of services to retail consumers. The rules are expected to define the exact conditions for satellite spectrum usage.

Companies like Bharti Oneweb, Starlink, Amazon Kuiper and Reliance Jio Satellite are to be given spectrum administratively as part of their global mobile personal communication by satellite services licences.

Similarly, though surrender of airwaves is allowed, the rules would make it clear as to how companies can relinquish spectrum and what charges need to be paid.

Another key aspect is around the biometric identification of a user, which has been made mandatory. As per experts, the rules should clearly specify details so that data of customers are not misused as multiple intermediaries may be involved in the collection and processing of this kind of sensitive information."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/ayodhya-case-judges-unanimously-decided-to-keep-verdict-anonymous-cji-chandrachud/articleshow/106456440.cms,"New Delhi, More than four years after the historic Ayodhya verdict of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud on Monday said the five-judges, who ruled in favour of construction of a Ram temple by a trust at the disputed site, had unanimously decided there will be no authorship ascribed to the judgement. On November 9, 2019, settling a fractious issue that went back more than a century, a five-judge bench headed by the then CJI Ranjan Gogoi had paved the way for construction of the temple and ruled that an alternative five-acre plot will be found for a mosque in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh.

In an exclusive interview with PTI, CJI Chandrachud, who was part of the constitution bench, candidly spoke on the issue of anonymity and said, when the judges sat together, as they do before a pronouncement, it was unanimously decided that this will be a ""judgement of the court"".

He was replying to the query as to why the name of the author judge was not made public.

""When the five-judge bench sat to deliberate on the judgement as we all do before a Judgement is pronounced, we all decided unanimously that this will be a judgement of the court. And, therefore, there was no authorship ascribed to any individual judge,"" the CJI said.

""The case has a long history of conflict, of diverse viewpoints based on the history of the nation and all those who were part of the bench decided that this will be a judgement of the court. The court will speak through one voice and the idea of doing so was to send a clear message that all of us stood together not only in the ultimate outcome but in the reasons indicated in the judgement,"" he said, adding ""I will close my answer with that.""

Delivering a unanimous verdict on the case that long polarised the country and frayed the secular tapestry of Indian society, the apex court bench had said in 2019 that the faith of Hindus that Lord Ram was born at the site was undisputed, and he was symbolically the owner of the land.

Yet, it is also clear that the destruction of the 16th century three-domed structure by Hindu kar sevaks, who want to build a Ram temple there, was a wrong that ""must be remedied,"" the court had said.

It said it is not concerned with faith and belief and instead treated the case as a title dispute over land between three parties -- the Sunni Muslim Waqf Board, the Nirmohi Akhara, a Hindu group, and the symbolic Lord Rama designated as Ram Lalla Virajman (the deity).

The judgement, running into 1,045 pages, was widely welcomed by Hindu politicians and groups, while the Muslim leadership said they will accept the verdict, even though they described it as flawed. Still, they called for peace and calm, and leaders across the political spectrum had noted that it was now time to move on. PTI MNL SJK ADS MNR MNL SK SK

The Prime Minister’s vision to build a Viksit Bharat through a far-reaching paradigm of sustainable and inclusive growth, the government’s multidimensional interventions including policies to accelerate physical and digital infrastructure hold the promise to transform India into a global manufacturing hub even as it strengthens its leadership in climate action, services growth and prowess in technology. An aspirational society and young demographics are contributing to a growing consumer market. FMCG therefore represents an area of immense potential.

The market size of the FMCG segment by 2030 is estimated at over Rs 21 trillion. Experts indicate that consumption rises at a much faster pace when per capita incomes cross $4,000, as is expected in India by 2030. There is today an increasing consumer preference for trusted brands, convenience, offerings in health and wellness as well as premium products. In 2024, a rising Bharat with unbounded aspirations, the massification of digital access and democratisation of premiumisation will further broaden opportunities for the FMCG sector.

The key driver to unleashing FMCG growth through a virtuous cycle of consumption, investment and income lies in creating gainful livelihood opportunities. It is here that the transformation of the agri sector gains critical importance given its predominant role in livelihood creation. This sector also bears the challenge of providing food security to India’s projected population of 1.5 billion by 2030 even as extreme weather events continue to multiply and make farmers vulnerable. It is mission critical to focus on adaptation measures to build climate resilience to secure livelihoods.

ITC has therefore launched an extensive Climate Smart Agriculture programme that is demonstrating encouraging results. ITC’s Mission Millets is also promoting this planet friendly crop through nutritious and innovative products, sustainable agriculture and consumer awareness. Adoption of digital technology by farmers to enhance productivity and access to gainful markets will create newer opportunities, an area that ITCMAARS is spearheading with an aspiration to reach 10 million farmers. Unleashing India’s tourism potential will also add to supporting largescale livelihoods. These concerted efforts to secure and raise incomes will not only fuel growth in FMCG but contribute to our shared aspiration of a developed India.

She expressed gratitude for the privilege to modify her appearance but stressed that her transformation did not stem from conventional methods like diet and exercise.

Addressing her insecurities, Sia articulated how being in the public eye triggers anxiety, prompting her to make choices aimed at enhancing her confidence. She urged support, stating, ""Pray for me please!"" This revelation echoed her prior openness about cosmetic procedures, as she previously brought her plastic surgeon onstage during the Daytime Beauty Awards in October.

The government is procuring onion to maintain a buffer stock and use it for market intervention to boost domestic availability and keep prices in check.

The government has raised the buffer stock target to 7 lakh tonnes for the 2023-24 fiscal, against the actual stock of 3 lakh tonnes last year.

Ishikawa and nearby areas felt the tremors, resulting in collapsed buildings, power outages for tens of thousands of homes, and reports of individuals trapped in rubble.

Urgent Calls for Elevation as Tsunami Threat Looms

The Japan Meteorological Agency has cautioned residents in Ishikawa and neighboring prefectures to seek higher ground immediately. Waves exceeding 1.2 meters struck Noto in Ishikawa, with forecasts predicting waves up to 3 meters. Concerns about fires, building collapses, and landslides have spurred advisories to steer clear of danger zones for at least a week.

If they did so, they would lose an election even for town dogcatcher. Nonetheless it doesn’t seem too much to suggest, in this season of hope, that 2024 might go significantly better than 2023 if more of our leaders around the world acknowledged realities about some of the troubles that beset us.

Topping the list is immigration, an issue that will play a critical role in the US presidential election and in the evolving politics of most European nations. The influx of foreigners, especially from the Southern Hemisphere, is widely perceived as posing an unacceptable threat to the traditional makeup — the ethnic composition — of American and European societies.

Donald Trump represents the incomers as parasites, wastrels, freeloaders and even criminals. He recently declared that immigrants “are poisoning the blood of our country.” His followers agree. They believe that America’s cultural identity stands imperiled.

In Europe, Italy received 150,000 unauthorized immigrants last year, an increase of more than 50% over 2022. Nearly 2.3 million migrants have arrived in Britain over the past two years, and 1.3 million have stayed.

Some Irish parliamentarians are demanding a national referendum on the government’s relatively open migration policy, whereby one-fifth of Ireland’s 5.1 million-person population was born elsewhere. They demand a cap on entries after a series of high-profile crimes committed by migrants. An asylum seekers’ hotel was recently the object of an arson attack.

Immigration Wrap 2023: The world wants more foreign workers, but only the highly skilled ones

The surge of right-wing parties on both sides of the Atlantic suggests that hundreds of millions of voters are furiously angry about this. Politicians who appear incapable of checking migration, or worse still, are unwilling to do so are being punished at the ballot box, a fate that could befall Joe Biden in 2024.

The cash incentives for people to move North from the South are huge. In Morocco, an unskilled worker makes around €8 ($9) a day, while in Spain they could earn five or six times that amount. Manual workers’ salaries in France and the Netherlands are 10 times higher than in North Africa.

In Mexico, the average farm worker earns $196 a month, while in California he or she could pull in nearer $2,500, albeit with much higher living costs. An estimated 11 million undocumented illegal immigrants currently live in the US, and it’s possible for them to secure employment without tough questions being asked or labor regulations enforced. If they are deported, as Trump promises will happen if he is elected, the US economy will feel pain.

Economic benefit is one of the arguments advanced by those who say that mass migration shouldn’t frighten us. One such is the Dutch academic Hein de Haas, author of the new book How Migration Really Works, to which I referred briefly in a November column. He claims that the historic statistics show that there is today no global “crisis”; that the main driver for population movement is our chronic need for cheap labor to perform jobs we are too rich and spoiled to do ourselves; and that attempts to seal our borders will fail.

International migrants amount to about 3% of the world population, which means 97% stay at home: “There is no evidence that global migration is accelerating,” de Haas writes. In the US, immigrants constitute about the same proportion of the total population, 14%, as they did a century ago.

He admits, however, that there is a historic change in the nature of mass movement, which for centuries was dominated by Europeans going west, to North America. Today Europe has instead become a key destination for arrivals from the Southern Hemisphere.

Moreover, de Haas’s book ignores the huge reality that whereas in the 19th century much of the US was relatively empty, today people are fighting for space, albeit amid a density much lower than that prevailing in, for instance, Britain.

The US population of 340 million has increased faster than that of most European nations, more than doubling from 1950’s 148 million. During the Christmas period, an estimated 10,000 illegal migrants a day were arriving at the Mexican border.

De Haas seems on stronger ground, however, when he asserts that in Britain, right-wing rage is mistaken to focus upon illegal entrants — people crossing the Channel in rubber boats. Their numbers are tiny compared with those who arrive with visas.

Since 2018, roughly 100,000 so-called small-boat crossers have entered Britain, almost one-third of them in 2023. The right-wing immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, resigned in protest at his own government’s failure to check this movement, declaring it “a national emergency that is doing untold damage to our country.” Sacked Home Secretary Suella Braverman used even more extreme language.

But during the same period our population has increased by more than 1 million, around 0.34% a year. The British Brexit government has authorized most of these arrivals because the economy and health and welfare services need them. I was thinking of such people as Braverman and Jenrick, very poor people’s Trumps, when I suggested at the outset that our societies might fare better if our leaders told us even a little of the truth, and abandoned fallacious rhetoric.

It’s a towering irony of Brexit that exiting the European Union was supposed to reduce migration. Yet, as many anti-Brexiters, including me, predicted at the time, quitting Europe did nothing to halt the inflow of migrants from the South. It merely stopped Poles, Romanians and the like coming and going freely, much to our cost, and made it more difficult for British people and goods to move freely to and from our biggest trading partners.

The overwhelming majority of new entrants into Britain since 2021 have been authorized by the anti-Europe governments of Boris Johnson and his successors, because they’ve been found indispensable to perform farm work and staff the health service and elder-care facilities — jobs which British people increasingly spurn. Each new worker can bring at least one dependent and further family members often follow.

Between 2017 and 2022, the share of non-UK born nurses in the health service rose to 45% from 20%, half from India or the Philippines. Almost one-third of UK general-practice doctors earned their degrees abroad — 54% of foreign qualified in Asia, 28% in Africa.

Throughout the developed world, female migrant workers — especially from the Philippines, Indonesia, Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador — play an important role as domestic servants. An Italian study found that almost 2 million migrants are working in private households. In Germany, a quarter of a million such people help to care for the elderly. A further factor in British migrant numbers is the huge influx of foreign students: Education revenue is critical to the British economy.

A common cry of the right in many countries is that border controls must be toughened. Yet in an age of cheap travel and vast international movement, it’s hard to make these stick, even if political will exists. Neither Mexican border walls nor Mediterranean and cross-Channel naval patrols are likely to achieve their purposes.

There is even evidence that allowing free movement makes people more willing to return to their homelands after studying or working. A researcher on migration issues, Simona Vezzoli, has made a case study of three Caribbean communities: Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. The first gained independence from Britain in 1960 and the second was set free by the Dutch in 1975, while the third remains a department of France — part of the EU in South America. Although all three started from roughly the same place in terms of history, location and economics, their 21st century experiences are very different.

French Guiana today has very low emigration because its people enjoy free movement to and from the EU, which many of them visit to work. Meanwhile a staggering 50% of the populations of Guyana and Suriname have permanently migrated abroad, most of the Guyanans to the US and the Surinamese to the Netherlands. Researchers who have studied their rival experiences suggest that these mass exoduses have been accelerated by fear of being trapped in their own impoverished societies by ever-more stringent entry restrictions imposed by richer nations.

Between 1986 and 2008, the underground migrant population in the US rose to 12 million from 3 million despite a fivefold increase in number of patrol officers and a 20-fold increase in funding for border enforcement. Hein de Haas argues from the US example: “Border enforcement drove migration underground.”

Many of the same American and European nationalists who are haunted by the threat posed by migration are also fierce opponents of foreign aid. This seems bizarre. The only credible long-term response to the prospect of ever-larger movements from the Southern Hemisphere — which Hein de Haas doesn’t believe will happen, but many of us are convinced pose a huge challenge — is to assist people to stay where they are.

Remittances sent home by workers abroad are an especially effective form of aid, because they reach the people for whom they are intended. In 2022, half a trillion dollars was dispatched back to developing countries by migrants.

The difficulties of preventing state aid from being stolen by the kleptocrats of Africa and Latin America remain formidable. But even greater hazards will face us if the world’s impoverished peoples, threatened by war, persecution and climate change, continue to quit their homelands. On present projections, this peril is real, and very large. I can’t share the complacency with which some liberals, including de Haas, view this prospect.

Most of us who adhere to the center of politics in our respective nations adopt a middle view about immigration. Our societies need some of it to support our economies. But uncontrolled population movements pose a huge political and social threat, fueling right-wing extremism.

It’s striking that autocrats, notably including Russian President Vladimir Putin, incite immigration to the West, because they perceive it as a disruptive force that aids their relentlessly hostile foreign-policy agenda. Putin applauds, for instance, the flight into Western Europe of 5 million Ukrainians who have escaped his assault on their homeland.

China’s President Xi Jinping is probably delighted that 150,000 of his critics and foes in Hong Kong have moved to Britain, the former colonial power. A further 5 million — 5 million — have a right, granted by Boris Johnson, to follow these if they choose, which is expected to be exercised by about 300,000.

Amid popular fury about the scale of migration, both the US and Europe are threatened with a resurgence of what we must call fascism. I can never forget the words of my old hero, British history Professor Michael Howard. He said to me, a year or two before his death in 2019: “Communism has been always an ideology of elites. But we should never forget that fascism was popular.”

A century ago, the German variation — Nazism — branded Jews as the source of the world’s perceived woes. Today, demagogues on both sides of the Atlantic focus their anger more widely upon foreigners, newcomers, outsiders of all hues.

In the years ahead, our rulers must convince voters that they understand their fears, and discover how to manage and limit immigration. The difficulties remain very great. If democratic governments fail, however, fascism much influenced by this perceived threat poses a real menace to our societies."

Originally planned as a limited series, the show has chosen Ireland as its new backdrop, shifting away from Australia. The protagonist, Elliot Stanley, portrayed by Jamie Dornan, wakes up in the Outback with severe memory loss, setting the stage for a thrilling narrative.

Dornan, speaking on Sky's Backstage podcast, revealed his influence in choosing to film the second series closer to home, leveraging the success of the first season where he served as an executive producer. Familiar with playing characters with memory loss, notably portraying Paul Spector in The Fall, Dornan emphasized the uniqueness of approaching his role in The Tourist.

The move to Ireland for the second season meant an entirely new ensemble of actors and crew, with Danielle MacDonald, known for her role in Dumplin', joining the cast. She described the series as ""genre-bending,"" blending dark themes with moments of levity.

The lead actor, Jamie Dornan, recently honored with a doctorate from Queen's University Belfast, humorously plans to display it in his office to assure people it's legitimate. Reflecting on his favorite shows and films of 2023, he highlighted Slow Horses and The Morning Show while praising the quality of films received as a member of the Academy.

The much-anticipated second season of The Tourist kicks off on BBC One at 9 pm on January 1, with all episodes available for streaming on BBC iPlayer from the same date.

Hackers have developed sophisticated Android malware that can disable biometric security and steal PINs and data. Known as Chameleon, it is an Android banking trojan that was first detected last year. The trojan malware can mimic legitimate apps and trick users into granting them permission. Once it has access to any device, it can monitor its activity and intercept credentials. BleepingComputer has reported it.

Malware bypasses security measures

The trojan malware can also bypass the security measures introduced in Android 13. This security measure, called the 'restricted setting feature' allows the users to control which apps can access certain settings and features on your device. This feature was supposed to prevent hackers from using the restricted setting feature to take over your device.

Malware tricks users

According to BleepingComputer, the malware can use a clever technique to trick the users into granting it permission to use the restricted setting feature without their consent. This means that the malware can control his device and even disable his fingerprint or face scan.

Chameleon displays a fake lock screen

After this, the malware displays a fake lock screen and asks the user to enter his PIN. If he does so, the malware will capture his PIN and unlock the device. It can then access his banking apps and other sensitive information. It can also go one step ahead and send money to the hackers’ accounts or purchase online goods without the user's knowledge.

If reports are to be believed, Chameleon uses a platform called Zombinder to attach the malware to innocent apps. Once a hacker learns a user's schedule, he can run the trojan when the phone is normally inactive.

How to protect

The easiest way to protect from the malware is only using legitimate app stores, like the Google Play Store, Amazon App Store, or Samsung Galaxy Store. Loading apps straight from the web, or sideloading, makes one vulnerable to security risks. A good antivirus software is installed. A good antivirus software actively running on devices will alert the user of any malware in his system, warn him against clicking on any malicious links in phishing emails and ultimately protect him from being hacked.

FAQs:

How does trojan malware Chameleon work?
The trojan malware Chameleon can mimic legitimate apps and trick users into granting it permissions. Once it has access to any device, it can monitor its activity and intercept credentials.

How can a device be protected from Android malware Chameleon?
A device can be protected from Android malware Chameleon by taking it only from legitimate app stores, like the Google Play Store, Amazon App Store, or Samsung Galaxy Store. Loading apps straight from the web, or sideloading, makes one vulnerable to security risks. A good antivirus software is installed.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/printing-date-of-manufacturing-unit-sale-price-on-packaged-items-becomes-mandatory-from-january-1/articleshow/106455875.cms,"New Delhi: Printing the 'date of manufacturing' and 'unit sale price' has become mandatory on all packaged commodities effective from Monday, according to Consumer Affairs Secretary Rohit Kumar Singh. Earlier, companies were given the option to either print the 'date of manufacturing' or 'date of import' or date of packaging on the packaged commodities.

Now, companies have been mandated to print only the 'date of manufacturing', along with the 'unit sale price', as per the latest notification issued by the Consumer Affairs Ministry.

""Since packaged items are sold in different quantities, it is important that consumers are aware about the 'unit sale price' of what is packed and make an informed purchase decision,"" the consumer affairs secretary told PTI.

Printing the date of manufacturing will help consumers know how old the packaged item is and help them make conscious purchase decisions.

Similarly, the printing of unit sale price will make it easy for consumers to ascertain the cost in unit terms.

For example, a packaged wheat flour of 2.5 kg will have a unit sale price per kg, along with the Maximum Retail Price (MRP).

Similarly, a packaged commodity of less than one kg quantity will have a sale price per gram, along with the total MRP of the product.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/2023-flashback-17-cooperative-banks-closed-down-highest-in-nine-years/articleshow/106456512.cms,"Concerns over financial health of the cooperative banking sector continued to haunt stakeholders with as many as 17 banks shutting shops in the year gone by, with the highest number of annual licence cancellations by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Of these, half a dozen banks were urban cooperative banks (UCBs), which otherwise fare better than their rural counterparts.

After 2014, a total of 60 cooperative banks -- both urban and rural -- were closed due to failure while three banks were revived including the Punjab & Maharashtra Cooperative Bank, which was merged with Unity Small Finance Bank. In 2022, a total of 12 cooperative banks shut shop.

The numbers of these banks coming under regulatory radar highlights the fact that the RBI tightened its scrutiny and supervisory role on cooperative banks over the years.

According to official documents, 39 UCBs at present are facing insolvency under 35A of Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as these banks either faced negative net worth or serious financial irregularities.

In general, the RBI remained anxious over the elevated non-performing assets at UCBs, although their stronger capital buffers and higher profitability provide them support. UCBs, 1,502 in number, have 8.8% gross NPA of their total advances of Rs 3.30 lakh crore. The scheduled UCBs have 6.6% gross NPA of their cumulative advances of Rs 1.52 lakh crore.

""A further strengthening of the quality of governance, based on the three pillars of compliance, risk management, and internal audit, warrants priority. The introduction of the four-tiered regulatory framework is a step forward in this direction. The flexibility allowed to financially sound and well managed UCBs in

opening branches will open new vistas of growth,"" the RBI said in its Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India, released last week.

In FY23, RBI brought the regulation of the co-operative banking sector at par with other banking entities including the prudential framework for stressed assets. In parallel, the regulated cooperative banks are now allowed to enter into outsourcing arrangements with lending service providers and digital lending platforms to enjoy more flexibility in doing business.

""Going forward, robust internal governance practices and continuous technological upgradation and innovations will help co-operative banks to expand their operations and improve their financial health,"" the RBI said.

Incredible stories from across India, connectivity and access like never before, innovation in filmmaking— there hasn’t been a more perfect time for storytellers and the audience.

Today, India stands only second to China in the volume of digital media consumption, as per the EY-Ficci 2023 report. Fans have never had more choice to enjoy great stories, whether that’s through the spike in smart TV penetration or the prevalence of fast, low-cost, internet-enabled devices.

Streaming services are reaching a wide range of audiences, with Netflix leading a cultural exchange that is changing the way we engage with the world. An unforgettable reminder of this impact, for me, will always be from a few years ago, when I heard a familiar tune play out at a local pandal: it was Bella Ciao (from Money Heist) featuring dhol!

This truly is the golden era of entertainment — and I firmly believe streaming will accelerate towards
solidifying itself as the ubiquitous medium of storytelling. There are so many stories to be told, across languages and from every village, town and city of our vibrant country. 2023 showed us that a powerful story can come from anywhere, and excite audiences everywhere.

The victory of RRR and The Elephant Whisperers at the Oscars, or Vir Das: Landing winning an International Emmy, are proof of this.

In 2024, I foresee a greater emphasis on programming that embraces the unique and the authentic. India
is a treasure trove of stories — and at Netflix, we are committed to celebrating it, across a variety of genres, with the best creators — from Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Yash Raj Films, Neeraj Pandey and Imtiaz Ali, to Abhishek Chaubey, Kanika Dhillon and Kapil Sharma.

It’s the classic thali — something for every taste and mood, and that’s what we want to serve to our members both in India and across the world.

Sarma while talking to media persons said, “The exercise of delimitation of assembly constituencies and parliamentary seats was done by Election Commission of India and the outcome was 96 seats were secured for Assamese people. In these seats only those residing in Assam for ages can win these seats.”

He said, “In 12 seats of Barak valley of Assam in around eight seats only the indigenous people of Barak valley will be able to win. If put together we have secured 106 seats for indigenous people. In the peace accords with ULFA it is incorporated that the main principles of delimitation exercise of assemblies and parliamentary constituencies will remain in future. This is done so that demography of the constituencies does not change, and political power remains with Assamese people.”

The chief minister said that this will secure Assam politically for another 30 to 40 years.” In the accord there is incorporated that a voter before changing his constituencies must fulfil several conditions. A person cannot encroach on the forest land and become a voter of a new constituency . One can change his voting area if he is the permanent resident by purchasing land or other substantial interest. The ordinary residency must be acquired, like someone is a government servant and moved due to services.”

The chief minister elaborated that there will be more discussion as to what more will be added. “ULFA accord has achieved what we tried to achieve through different ways. This accord has ensured the highest level of protection within the constitution of India.”

He added, “We will bring bills in assembly to enable various provisions of this clause of the accord. The government of India when it brings a legislation for delimitation in the country, there will be separate provisions of Assam, we will bring laws to the voters conditionality”.

He said that by Assamese we mean those staying in Assam for ages. Those who live in Assam for 200 to 300 years are Assamese. “

The political landscape of Assam stands changed after almost 27 years as the Election commission of India has published the Delimitation of assembly and parliamentary constituencies last year.

On December 29, the government of India and ULFA inked a peace accord.

""This (2023) has been good year for the steel sector in India, even though it was a challenging period globally,"" Narendran said here.

""The recovery of the steel industry is still continuing post the global pandemic. In fact, we recovered well due to good handling of micro-economy by the RBI, and the investment that has been made for infrastructure development,"" he said at a New Year programme.

Companies like Smartworks, Awfis, IndiQube, Urban Vault and EFC I Ltd. currently derive 5% to 25% of their revenue from non-rental sources, with plans to increase this.

""We have established a comprehensive ecosystem within our spaces to enhance convenience for our members, offering such as on-site gyms, sports areas, laundry services, recreational zones, convenience stores, amphitheatres and more,"" said Harsh Binani, cofounder of Smartworks.

Currently, only 5–8% of Smartworks’ revenue is non-rental, and it continues to grow. Some of the services that generate revenue for Smartworks include F&B, grocery, creche, laundry, meeting rooms and transportation.

IndiQube’s co-founder Rishi Das said, “During FY22–23, the rental income received from the companies accounted for 80% of the total collections. The remaining 20% constituted non-rental revenue that included electricity, maintenance, and other allied services.”

Typically, flexible office space operators generate incidental revenues through booking of meeting rooms, canteen charges, and fees for client-specific services.

“In our case, there is an additional source of revenue that is quite significant, which is revenue from interior fit-out,” said EFC founder and CEO Umeash Sahhaaii. “EFC I Ltd. has developed the skill set over a period of a decade to fit out commercial spaces, not just in the office space sector but also in the sectors of hospitality, healthcare, R&D and education.”

Under the fit-out division, EFC I Ltd. not only does the interior and furniture but also works on contracts for others to fit out office spaces and other types of facilities.

Revenue from rental is about 77% for the company, while the rest comes from other services. The company wants to take non-rental revenue to 40% in the near future.

“Non-rental revenue is expected to account for 4% of the total revenue in FY 23–24,” said Mishra, cofounder of Urban Vault, a Bengaluru-based managed co-working space provider that also provides fit-out as a service. “We plan to elevate this percentage to double digits in the next fiscal year.”

India’s top flexible workspace providers are expected to post 30–60% growth in revenue this financial year.

Pre-Covid, there were around 400 operators across 1,500 locations in about 55 cities in India. This has increased to around 965 operators spanning 2,320 locations in about 90 cities, indicating a noticeable increase in the utilisation of commercial real estate spaces."

""The total value of Rs 2,000 bank notes in circulation, which amounted to Rs 3.56 lakh crore as at the close of business on May 19, 2023, when the withdrawal of Rs 2,000 bank notes was announced, has declined to Rs 9,330 crore as at the close of business on December 29, 2023,"" the RBI said in a statement.

Thus, 97.38 per cent of the high-value currency in circulation as of May 19, 2023, has since been returned to the banking system, it added.

""The Rs 2,000 bank notes continue to be legal tender,"" the RBI added.

People can deposit and/or exchange Rs 2,000 bank notes at the 19 RBI offices across the country. People can also send Rs 2,000 bank notes through India Post from any post office to any of the RBI Issue Offices for credit to their bank accounts in India.

Public and entities holding such notes were initially asked to either exchange or deposit them in bank accounts by September 30. The deadline was later extended to October 7. Deposit and exchange services at bank branches were discontinued on October 7.

Starting October 8, individuals have been provided with the choice of either exchanging the currency or having the equivalent sum credited to their bank accounts at the 19 offices of the RBI.

Meanwhile, queues are being witnessed during working hours at the RBI offices for exchange/deposit of Rs 2,000 notes.

The 19 RBI offices depositing/exchanging the bank notes are in Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Belapur, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh, Chennai, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Jammu, Kanpur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Nagpur, New Delhi, Patna and Thiruvananthapuram.

The Rs 2,000 bank notes were introduced in November 2016 following the demonetisation of the then-prevailing Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 bank notes.

In his New Year message, Mahindra also said all signs point to the Indian economy achieving ""the mythical lift-off that we have been awaiting, for decades"" and predicted that in 2024 ""companies that are able to create a portfolio of desirable products both in features and price will face the happy challenge of raising their production to meet demand"".

Stressing that ""a New Year is special because it always symbolises a new beginning"", he said, ""No matter how dark the year has gone by, the human spirit has an abiding capacity for hope. 2023 was a year characterised by conflict, climate change and a sluggish post-Covid recovery. The year ended with the world crying out for renewal.""

The first day of the new year opens a new chapter, a fresh opportunity for optimism and renewal, he added.

""Globally, the world needs India to become a reliable challenger to China's supply-chain dominance. That is the great opportunity of 2024. That is what will fuel the lift-off. Investment is going to flow into India in unprecedented volumes,"" Mahindra said.

He further said, ""The opportunity for India's manufacturing to achieve a quantum leap is within our grasp or ours to lose. Let's seize it with both hands because growth in manufacturing and exports will, in turn, enhance the consumption story, setting into motion a virtuous cycle that could endure for years.""

In the long run, however, what will keep India's economy on the ascent is a capacity for disruptive innovation, Mahindra said adding ""that aspiration is showing up in many of the newer startups. More power to this tribe!""

In 2023, he said the Mahindra group also faced the challenges first-hand in the communities its work with around the world being a transnational business.

""We also experienced the joy of overcoming those challenges, and in most situations, achieved extraordinary success. Our great advantage and opportunity in 2024 comes from our deeply embedded Indian roots. Because all signs point to the Indian economy achieving the mythical 'lift-off' that we have been awaiting, for decades!,"" he said.

While the rest of the world faced increasing turbulence over the last few years, India kept the engine of the economy chugging along through doses of government capital and infrastructure investment, Mahindra noted.

""Now, the good news is that the consumption story is about to kick in. Companies that are able to create a portfolio of desirable products both in features and price will face the happy challenge of raising their production to meet demand,"" he said.

As the sun rises in 2024, Mahindra asserted. ""It's time for Carpe Diem - it's time to seize the day. Our destiny lies in our own hands.""

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/uk/colorado-mother-suspected-of-child-murders-arrested-in-uk-police/articleshow/106455210.cms,"A Colorado woman suspected of the murder of two of her children was arrested in the United Kingdom, as confirmed by the Colorado Springs police. Kimberlee Singler, 35, was taken into custody without any reported incident, as detailed by the local authorities on Sunday. Specifics regarding the location of the arrest and possible extradition were yet to be disclosed by the police department.

The arrest warrant against Singler includes charges of murder, attempted murder, child abuse, and assault, as per the police statement. Singler was last seen on December 23, and her apprehension abroad raised questions about the circumstances and potential legal proceedings related to her extradition.

The tragic incident unfolded on December 19 when law enforcement responded to a 911 call reporting a burglary at Singler's condominium unit. Upon arrival, authorities found the lifeless bodies of a 9-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy at the scene. Singler, along with her 11-year-old daughter, was found and subsequently hospitalized.

Initially treated as a victim following the reported burglary, Singler’s status transitioned to a suspect as the investigation progressed, revealed the Colorado police to CNN. While Singler initially cooperated with authorities, her level of cooperation diminished over time, leading to challenges in maintaining contact with her.

The unraveling details indicate that the reported burglary may have been a misrepresentation, prompting law enforcement to obtain the arrest warrant for Singler. Additionally, court records suggest a history of a contentious, years-long divorce case between Singler and her estranged husband.

The Colorado Springs Police Department’s homicide unit continues its collaborative efforts with multiple law enforcement agencies in the ongoing investigation. Further details regarding the arrest and potential developments in the case are anticipated to be unveiled in subsequent news conferences.

Singler, now facing charges that include four counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, is expected to navigate the legal processes for potential extradition back to the United States to face trial.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/new-year-top-6-make-or-break-events-for-stock-investors-in-2024/articleshow/106431885.cms,"NEW DELHI: Equity markets have a tendency to surprise investors just when everything is looking either picture perfect or too gloomy. The event-heavy calendar of 2024 has enough major triggers that can make the new year a roller-coaster ride for both bulls and bears.

While no one is yet expecting Nifty to repeat 2023-like 20% annual return, the consensus target seems to be hovering around the 23,000-mark as most of the positives expected in the new year are already priced in.

""2024 will be an interesting year as developed economies are likely to slow down, but challenges of rate hikes are unlikely. The year could see the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by mid-year, which will help the equity markets. However, elections in India and the US elections are likely to result in higher volatility, which means reduced market breadth and focus shifting to liquidity and quality management within the portfolio,"" said Naveen Kulkarni, Chief Investment Officer, Axis Securities PMS.

Here are the top 6 events to track in 2024:

1) Interim Budget
In the Interim Budget to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, some minor sops may be offered to the salaried class by likely tweaking of tax slabs. ""The twin objective of minor relief to the taxpayers coupled with encouraging taxpayers to shift to a new tax regime is likely to be achieved by tweaking the tax slabs,"" Sunny Agrawal, Head of Fundamental Equity Research, SBI Securities, said.


2) Lok Sabha election
Dalal Street has already discounted the Modi government's victory in the Lok Sabha election. Any negative surprise can, therefore, result in shocks while the positives are already priced in.

The months preceding the elections are, however, filled with investor optimism. An analysis of the last 5 Lok Sabha polls shows that in the preceding 6-month period Nifty rose an average of 13%.

""The market has discounted the outcome of the general election and we don't see any major volatility during the budget and election period,"" said Siddarth Bhamre of Religare Broking.


3) Fed meetings
Investors are expecting the US Fed to start reducing interest rates as early as March after Jerome Powell indicated at 3 rate cuts in 2024. A delay in the beginning of the rate cut cycle has the capacity to add stress to capital inflows.

The first meeting of the Fed's rate cutting panel in 2023 would be held from January 30-31 while the second one is from March 19-20.

4) Full year Budget
After the formation of the new government post Lok Sabha election, a full-year Budget would be presented in the Parliament. While the present government may not take bold decisions in the Interim Budget, the full year Budget may have a different story to tell.

5) RBI MPC
Investors would also expect the RBI to cut interest rates in 2024 in sync with global rate cuts. RBI is expected to continue its stance of “withdrawal of accommodation” till FY24 and change stance in H2CY24 with estimated rate cuts of overall 50 bps in CY2024, HDFC Securities said.

6) US Elections
The year 2024 is an election year not just in India but also in the USA, UK, Russia, EU and South Korea. Altogether there are at least 64 countries that will go to the polls this year, the impact of which will be felt in geopolitics in the coming years. Ahead of the US election in November 2024, there is an expectation of subdued oil prices.

What should investors do?
With most of the positives already priced in, Nifty is expected to give single digit returns in 2024.

""Risk-reward ratios favour large-caps over mid & small-caps currently, and PSUs still have potential for outperformance, in our view. We remain constructive on banks, select NBFCs, real estate, and pharma. Investors with a long-term horizon can start accumulating chemicals and IT stocks on dips,"" said Jitendra Gohil of Kotak Alternate Asset Managers.

Experts suggest a multi-asset investment strategy as both equity and non-equity can provide a moderate return.

The company said revenues tripled this year driven by new products such as Nero and building channel partners to boost sales. It expects sales to grow four times in 2024.

""We have a strong product market fit with 100% customer retention. While 80% of farmers have purchased additional devices, word of mouth has played a huge role in getting the new customers. Farmers are consistently getting 25% better yield and 45% more income,"" said Sudhanshu Rai, cofounder of Fyllo that works with more than 5000 farmers.

India's agritech market is US$204 million but has a significantly low market penetration of 1 percent of the overall agritech market potential, according to a Deloitte CII report. With the penetration of technology, this sector can unleash massive opportunities for new agritech start-ups and expansion opportunities for existing ones.

""The government is making an effort to build an interoperable, open-source agricultural DPI for creating farmer-centric solutions and supporting the agritech industry and start-ups. Technology will transform the entire farming production cycle, from sowing to production to distribution, thereby reshaping the future of the industry. Figure 6 depicts a few digital solutions that may revolutionise every stage of farming,"" the report said.

During the year, the company also launched multiple services including precise fertilizer schedule, a pesticide schedule based on climate conditions adhering to the norms of global GAP, rolled out prediction models covering the challenges of poor flowering, flower dropping, fruit cracking.

Climate change has brought a lot of uncertainties with un-timely onset of diseases and pests, poor flowering etc. and hence farmers are in need of climate-resilient practices. For instance, the production of cotton reduced to 50% due to untimely attack of pink ball worms while the production of pomegranate reduced in Kutch and grapes in Maharashtra due to unseasonal rains.

""This made Fyllo a one stop solution, solving all kinds of uncertainties due to climate change and gut-based decisions for farmers,"" said Rai adding that the overall market in upcoming years will grow exponentially.

Growing area of horticulture fruits, vegetables has grown to 28 million hectares and overall, 15 million hectares of irrigated area is under micro irrigation which means that farmers are already at the level of using the latest technology. At present, India is adding 1.2 million hectares under micro irrigation every year, highest globally. Export of fruits and vegetables from India is at an all time high currently at $4 billion including processed and the local consumption has increased."

The strongest quake measured 7.6, leading to tsunami warnings and advisories, prompting authorities to urge residents to move to higher ground. The series of strong quakes on Japan's western coastline triggered tsunami alerts, with a major warning for Ishikawa and lower-level warnings for the rest of Honshu's western coast.

Authorities called for immediate evacuation in affected areas, emphasizing the potential for more major quakes in the coming days. The quakes caused damages at some places. Bullet trains were halted while highways were closed in affected places. Japanese media captured scenes of people standing near large pavement cracks, and the Meteorological Agency warned of the possibility of additional major quakes over the next week.

A video shared by BNO News the moments the captured by a train passenger when the region was hit by a 7.6-magnitude earthquake. The video shows both the train and signboards on the platform shaking intensely.

Tsunami warnings were issued for Hokkaido, North Korea, and Russia, with Sakhalin placed on alert. South Korea's weather agency advised coastal residents to monitor sea level changes.

Another video shared by BNO News shows people at a restaurant ducking for cover under tables during the powerful earthquake.

A special emergency center was established by the Japanese government to rapidly relay quake and tsunami information for public safety. Japan, prone to earthquakes, previously faced a major quake and tsunami disaster in March 2011, resulting in nuclear plant meltdowns.

Meanwhile, tsunami warnings have been sounded in North Korea, South Korea and Russia.

A Japanese official said that 7.6 magnitude quake to hit the Noto peninsula region in Ishikawa was the highest ever recorded since 1885 when data became available.

Meanwhile, Japan nuclear regulation authorities have said that there is no risk of radio activity leaking from nuclear plants in areas affected by earthquake and tsunami.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/high-import-duties-resisting-pressure-to-open-agri-sector-imp-to-ensure-indias-food-security-gtri/articleshow/106455324.cms,"Maintaining high import duties on sensitive agri commodities like rice and resisting pressure to open up the domestic sector to low tariffs will be crucial for preserving India's self-sufficiency and ensuring food security for its population, a report said on Monday. Economic think tank GTRI (Global Trade Research Initiative) in its report said that India needs to cut its reliance on imported vegetable oils to promote better health outcomes and also reduce the import bill.

This will need educating consumers about the health benefits of using locally produced oils like mustard, groundnut, and rice bran in lieu of imported oils.

India is the world's largest importer of vegetable oils, with imports estimated to double to USD 20.8 billion in 2023-24 from USD 10.8 billion in 2017-18.

It added that the US and EU currently support agriculture by using the latest technology to maximise output, high tariffs (or import duties) to discourage imports and massive subsidies to push exports.

Developed and agri-exporting countries like Australia always push developing countries like India to cut duties and subsidies on agri commodities to push their exports.

India has built a high import tariff wall (30-100 per cent on sensitive items) to check subsided imports. India also does not cut tariffs on sensitive items for even its FTA (free trade agreement) partners.

The report said that this has paid India with self-sufficiency in almost all products.

""India needs to continue with its current approach to not open the domestic agriculture sector to low tariff subsidised imports. Upholding high import tariffs on sensitive items and resisting pressure to open up the domestic agriculture sector to low-tariff subsidised imports will be crucial for preserving India's hard-earned self-sufficiency and ensuring food security for its burgeoning population,"" it said.

According to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, net cereal imports by developing countries will almost triple over the next 30 years while their net meat imports might even increase by a factor of almost five.

While most countries will be dependent on food imports, India is lucky to be self-sufficient in all agriculture and food items except vegetable oils.

India's agricultural imports are estimated to touch USD 33 billion in 2023 which will be just 4.9 per cent of total merchandise imports.

""This has become possible due to focus on policies like the green and white revolution, high import tariffs and active negotiations at the WTO (World Trade Organisation) to protect food security concerns for the 1.4 billion people over developed country pressure to open Indian agriculture to subsidised imports,"" GTRI Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava said.

On the sugar sector, the report said that India is the world's largest sugar exporter after Brazil, but this year, it will import sugar in vast quantities as the sugar imports are estimated to grow steeply by 385.4 per cent, from USD 252 million in 2022 to USD 1,223.4 million in 2023.

Imports have increased in 2023 due to a decline in domestic production caused by weak rains.

India dominates the global sugar scene as the largest producer, consumer, and second-largest exporter. Its sugar industry, ranking second in agro-based sectors, employs millions.

""Despite this, the industry faces competitiveness challenges, relying heavily on subsidies, free power, and water, leading many times to overproduction and market volatility. Water scarcity compounds issues, threatening industry sustainability,"" Srivastava said.

To thrive, the Indian sugar sector must aim to boost sugarcane yield from 55 to the global average of 70 tonnes per hectare, free from subsidies.

""Production uncertainties force frequent policy changes to keep local prices in control, but dissuading long-term investments and hindering strategic planning for future businesses,"" he added.

Vegetable oil, pulses, and fresh and dry fruits account for 72.1 per cent of agriculture imports of India in 2023. Vegetable oil is the largest import constituent, accounting for 51.9 per cent of total agriculture imports of India.

India imports 4 types of oils: Crude Palm Oil (CPO), Soya Bean Crude Oil, Crude Sunflower Seed Oil, and Refined Bleached Deodorized (RBD) Palmolein.

The report said that imports in 2023 are set to decline by 18.6 per cent to USD 17.1 billion compared to 2022, primarily due to a fall in import prices, not in quantities.

Further, it said that India's pulses imports are expected to rise by 44 per cent to surpass USD 2.7 billion in 2023 as compared to 2022.

The major pulses and import values in 2023 are Masoor (lentil) at USD 1.13 billion, Arhar/Tuar (pigeon peas) at USD 766 million, Urad (beans of vigna mungo) at USD 536 million, Rajma (kidney beans) at USD 120 million, and Kabuli Chana at USD 76 million.

India is the world's largest producer and consumer of pulses. It aims to enhance domestic production and cut imports by introducing high-yielding, disease-resistant pulse varieties.

The key challenges include addressing water scarcity and mitigating market volatility issues.

""Major efforts extend to reclaiming fallow land, promoting intercropping, and focusing on rainfed areas. Also, the market and infrastructure support involve ensuring fair prices through Minimum Support Price (MSP), investing in storage and processing, and establishing direct marketing channels,"" he said.

Her release from a Missouri prison following her involvement in the tragic demise of Claudine “Dee Dee” Blanchard shed light on a harrowing narrative of enduring medical manipulation.

Taking to social media, particularly TikTok, Gypsy Rose jubilantly exclaimed, ""I'm finally free,"" expressing profound gratitude for the overwhelming support pouring in from well-wishers. Her videos radiated happiness as she savored the serene surroundings of her return to Louisiana.

Dee Dee Blanchard's sinister actions subjected her daughter to a fabricated life of debilitating illnesses, coercing her into a wheelchair and maintaining a façade of severe health conditions that Gypsy didn't actually suffer from. Dee Dee's psychological disorder, Munchausen syndrome by proxy, led to substantial charity gains and even manipulated medical professionals by exploiting tragic events like Hurricane Katrina.

Misled by her mother about her own well-being, Gypsy Rose sought emancipation from the stifling environment orchestrated by Dee Dee, ultimately involving her then-boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, in a tragic turn of events resulting in Dee Dee's death.

Post-release, Gypsy Rose actively engaged her social media followers, promoting an upcoming docuseries titled ""The Prison Confession of Gypsy Rose Blanchard,"" set to air on Lifetime. Additionally, she introduced her e-book, ""Released: Conversations on the Eve of Freedom,"" sharing her reflections and learnings from the past eight and a half years.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/venture-highway-sells-part-of-stake-in-meesho-to-westbridge-capital/articleshow/104403392.cms,"Venture Highway, one of the early investors in Meesho, said it has sold a portion of its stake in the ecommerce startup to India-focused investment fund WestBridge Capital signalling investor interest in the Indian startup ecosystem despite the ongoing funding winter.

Venture Highway did not disclose the size of its stake sale or the proceeds from the transaction. The firm, however, said it made more than 50 times returns on its investment in Meesho from its first “vintage” fund.

ET reported on September 29 that WestBridge Capital was looking to buy about 2% stake in Meesho at $3 billion valuation through a secondary transaction. Venture Highway held about 3% in Meesho prior to the stake sale, said a person in the know.

“Having firmly believed in Meesho’s culture and founding principles, it has been a pleasure to be part of its journey since inception. We have closely witnessed how the company disrupted and transformed India’s online e-commerce landscape with its unparalleled vision. We continue to remain excited for the company’s success, especially, on its mission to democratise internet commerce for everyone,” said Neeraj Arora, founding partner at Venture Highway.

Venture Highway first invested in Meesho in 2015. The exit comes just days after Venture Highway cofounder Samir Sood stepped down as a partner of the firm. At the same time, it appointed Priya Mohan as the managing partner.

Meanwhile, WestBridge has been active in funding technology startups such as listed SaaS firm Freshworks, ecommerce firm Dealshare, edtech PhysicsWallah and Lead, among others.

SoftBank-backed Meesho was last valued at nearly $5 billion in 2021 following its $570 million funding led by US-based Fidelity and B Capital. Typically, secondary transactions take place at a discount to the previous primary valuation.

On August 7, Meesho said it posted a profit on a consolidated basis after tax for July, without disclosing specific numbers. ET had reported in April that Meesho was trying to reduce its cash burn to save capital and had readjusted growth expectations accordingly. It is said to be on an annualised revenue run-rate of around $750 million.

The secondary stake sales come at a time when big-ticket, growth stage deals continue to be rare in the Indian startup sector. However, late-stage startups are seeing secondary transactions between investors. FirstCry and Lenskart are among companies that recently closed secondary sale of shares, onboarding new investors."

After a reign spanning more than five decades, she revealed her intentions to pass the throne to her son, Crown Prince Frederik, citing personal reflections prompted by a back surgery she underwent in February 2023.

""In two weeks' time, I have been Queen of Denmark for 52 years,"" the Queen expressed, acknowledging the significant duration of her reign. ""The time takes its toll, and the number of 'ailments' increases. One cannot undertake as much as one managed in the past.""

Describing her surgery experience, she commended the skilled healthcare professionals who facilitated her recovery. The operation, she disclosed, prompted contemplation about the future and the appropriateness of transitioning responsibility to the next generation. Consequently, she determined that the moment was right to step down.

Detailing her abdication plans, Queen Margrethe II specified the date of transition, January 14, 2024, marking precisely 52 years since she assumed the throne following the passing of King Frederik IX. Her son, Crown Prince Frederik, will ascend as His Majesty King Frederik X, according to the Danish Prime Minister's office, with his wife, Princess Mary, becoming the Queen Consort—a significant milestone as the first Australian to hold this esteemed position in Denmark's history.

The impending royal transition has garnered widespread attention, particularly given Princess Mary's roots in Australia, where she previously worked as a real estate sales executive in Hobart, Tasmania. The couple's notable meeting during the 2000 Sydney Olympics and subsequent journey into Danish royalty have captured the public's imagination, ensuring heightened interest in the impending ceremony, especially from Princess Mary's former home.

The official proclamation of this historic change in the throne will occur on January 14 at Christiansborg Castle, following a meeting in the Council of State. Despite relinquishing her role as monarch, Queen Margrethe II will retain her title as Her Majesty, maintaining a symbolic connection to her legacy and contribution to Denmark.

Denmark's constitutional framework limits the role of its royals, with parliamentary authority prevailing. However, the monarchy continues to serve as a crucial diplomatic conduit and holds the responsibility of approving new legislation. Queen Margrethe II has consistently enjoyed widespread support from the Danish populace throughout her life, solidifying her legacy as a revered and respected figurehead.

The Congress maintained that the conviction had been handed down in a case involving the minister’s personal business, and the case has nothing to do with his official position.

The minister, who hails from Shivamogga district, has not misused taxpayers’ money, committed any irregularity or a scam or has caused financial loss to the government, the ruling party said, dismissing the demands for his sacking from the ministry.

The Congress, instead, sought to turn tables on the BJP, seeking an answer on the charges levelled by its own MLA (Basanagouda Patil Yatnal) that the previous government was involved in a Rs 40,000 crore scam. BJP state unit president BY Vijayendra must answer these allegations instead of diverting to Bangarappa’s case.

A special court, last week, convicted the education minister in a cheque bounce case and ordered him to pay a fine of Rs 6.96 crore failing which he was ordered to undergo a sentence of six months. The court held Akash Audio-Video and its director Madhu Bangarappa guilty under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act.

Soon after the verdict was out, Vijayendra and the BJP called the development a `black mark’ on the government and sought Bangarappa Jr’s resignation to uphold moral values. He urged chief minister Siddaramaiah to fire the minister if he does not resign on his own.

The positive chart pattern like higher tops and bottoms is intact on the daily chart and the Nifty is currently forming a new higher top of the sequence. A decisive move above 21,850 level is expected to nullify the present bearish effect and that could open more upside for the near term. Immediate support is placed at 21,550 level, Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said.

OI data showed that on the call side, the highest OI was observed at 22,000 followed by 21,800 strike prices while on the put side, the highest OI was at 21,700 strike price.




Nifty remained volatile throughout the session as traders remained indecisive. On the hourly chart, the Nifty fell below 20 DMA on an intraday basis before closing on a positive note. Going forward, a decisive fall below 21,650 might call for a directional fall in the market. On the higher end, a close above 21,750 might take the index towards the higher levels.


To recoup the losing bias, the index must close over 21,800 on a decisive note. Selling pressure may intensify if the support of 21,500 is taken out on an aggressive note. Option data showed a spike in 21,700 PE, with 21,800 CE witnessing writing.

The Nifty Bank rose over 8% in December 2023 and more than 11% in a year, Trendlyne data showed. The level of 48,000 will now act as a crucial support for the index, suggest experts.

The Nifty Bank underperformed the Nifty50 as it closed 57 points lower at 48,234. The Nifty50 hit a fresh record high of 21,834 on Monday but failed to hold on to the momentum. The last 30-minute sell-off pushed the index to close flat.

""The fall in the index was led by losses in IDFC First Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and SBI. Some buying was seen in PNB, Bank of Baroda, Bandhan Bank, ICICI Bank and Federal Bank,"" he said.

The index is trading above most of the crucial short and long-term moving averages such as 5, 10, 30, 50, 100, and 200-DMA on the daily charts which is a positive sign for the bulls.

The Nifty Bank index opened marginally lower, but managed to hold 48,150 zones and gradually moved higher towards 48,450 zones in the latter part of the day.

The index witnessed selling pressure in the last 30 minutes of trade, which was largely in line with the trend seen in the benchmark index. It formed a Doji kind of candle on the daily charts, which signifies indecisiveness among bulls and bears.

“Some cool-off was seen from higher zones in the last hour of the session and the Nifty Bank index formed a Doji candle on the daily scale. The index has got stuck in a wider range in between 47,800 to 48,500 zones from the past few sessions and momentum is missing on either side,” said Chandan Taparia, Senior Vice President and Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

“Till it holds above 48,000 zones it can witness an up move towards 48,500 then its recent life high of 48,636 zones, while on the downside support is seen at 48,000 then 47,750 levels,” he said.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/environment/global-warming/ongc-seeks-partners-to-cut-gas-flaring-zero-methane-emission-by-2030/articleshow/106453860.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's top oil and gas producer ONGC is seeking global technology partners to cut gas flaring and achieve zero methane emission by 2030 as part of its ambitious decarbonisation plan, its chairman Arun Kumar Singh said on Monday. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has substantially cut gas flaring -- burning of methane gas that is produced when oil is extracted from below surface -- and would look to bring it down to nil as part of its environmental commitments.

In a post on LinkedIn, Singh said India's role in the global energy landscape is progressively becoming pivotal, and is likely to account for 25 per cent of global energy demand growth over the next two decades.

According to the International Energy Agency, India's share in global primary energy consumption is expected to rise to 9.8 per cent by 2050.

""India's share in cumulative global green-house-gas (GHG) emissions has been only 4 per cent, and current emission is 7 per cent, despite its population share of 16-17 per cent,"" he said. ""As a responsible corporate citizen of the world, we are fully aware of our obligation towards the mother planet, which is shared by developing and developed world alike. Accordingly, our nation is chasing a paradigm shift in energy consumption, with a focus on cleaner, greener, and sustainable alternatives.""

With increasing energy demand, the commitment to decarbonisation is stronger than ever.

""ONGC has made significant contributions in reducing gas flaring in our exploration and production (E&P) operations, aligning with our environmental commitments; we have consistently worked to bring it lower and lower, and we aim to bring avoidable flaring down to zero by 2030.

""Similarly, substantive reduction has been achieved in the area of methane emission, and we aim to bring it down to zero level by 2030,"" he said.

Singh said ONGC uses a lot of gas to generate electricity as well as meet compression and other process needs of an oil and gas field. By 2028, this gas is intended to be replaced with green power wheeled to installations as far as 160 km from the west coast. The gas thus freed will be sold to industries like fertiliser and power plants.

""We envisage to wheel green electricity to our Mumbai Offshore fields on the Arabian Sea, replacing natural gas, currently being used to drive power devices at process platforms,"" he said.

Companies around the globe have pledged to slash down methane emissions by 30 per cent from 2020 levels by 2030. Methane, which is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, tends to leak into the atmosphere.

This is sometimes deliberate when companies flare the gas that comes alongside crude oil, due to lack of consumption markets. It also can leak undetected from drill sites, gas pipelines and other oil and gas equipment.

Controlling methane, which has been rising in atmospheric concentration for decades, is seen as one of the easiest and cheapest ways to make an immediate impact on global greenhouse gas emissions.

""Collaboration and innovation are the key here. Realising this need, we extend an invitation to all the innovators offering superior technology and are ahead on the learning curve relating to this goal of nil methane emission and zero avoidable flaring,"" he said.

He went on to ask technology innovators to write to ONGC on possible solutions to the flaring and methane emission problem.

Flaring, which used to be done in the past because of lack of customers for gas, has been reduced by almost 80 per cent, he said.

Crude oil pumped out of ground can easily be transported in trucks but to take gas from remote well locations to industries requires pipelines.

Sometimes, the amount of gas coming out with oil is so low that laying a pipeline becomes uneconomical.

ONGC used to flare 14-15 million standard cubic metres per day, but this has now come down to around 2 per cent.

Gas flaring reduction and zero methane emissions are part of ONGC's decarbonisation drive which will also see the company putting up 10 gigawatt of plants to generate electricity from solar and wind, and constructing a 1 million tonnes per annum green ammonia plant on the west coast.

ONGC is also looking at setting pump storage projects at river dams to meet electricity demand at night when solar power cannot be generated. It will also set up compressed biogas plants to convert agri waste into gas that can be used to generate electricity, make fertiliser or turned into CNG to run automobiles.

The company, which accounts for about two-thirds of India's oil production and about 58 per cent of gas, plans to invest Rs 2 lakh crore on clean energy projects to meet its 2038 net-zero carbon emissions goal.

High pressure gas valued at Rs 816.08 crore was flared in Mumbai High field -- the mainstay fields of ONGC -- during 2012-20, according to a CAG report released in December 2021.

During 2012-13 to 2019-20, a total of 1,227.343 million metric standard cubic metres of high pressure gas valued at Rs 1,021.08 crore was flared, according to the CAG report.

On December 23, 2023, the Tata Group-owned Air India had received India's first ever Airbus A350, registered as VT-JRA.

""This moment marks a red-letter day for all of us at Air India. The A350 is not just metal and engines; it’s the flying embodiment of the relentless efforts of all Air India employees towards our airline’s continuing transformation and of our commitment to setting new benchmarks. It is also, in many ways, a declaration of Indian aviation’s resurgence on the world stage,"" Campbell Wilson, Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director, Air India had said in a statement.

The A350-900 aircraft of Air India boasts a three-class cabin layout, accommodating 316 seats.

And of course, the public sector enterprises and utilities and banks are also doing well. So those are the ones that one should ride on and we will probably make some good money this first half of 2024.”

Is there any specific thing that you are looking at overall in the auto sector that you would find attractive? We are seeing the numbers coming in, not much of an excitement, but anything that you would find attractive there right now?
Pashupati Advani: I am actually not so wild about the auto sector as most others. It is a question of December numbers not being so great. And it looks like dealers now are promising new cars in February, March, which means there is stock and there is stock coming. And so they are going to be able to deliver, whereas a little while ago you were waiting six months for a car. So that is probably not so great for the autos and the auto ancillaries.

Market leaders are actually taking it up. ITC has not been doing very much and it is an index heavyweight. So it is good if you are going to be finally moving again. I am not as bullish on the IT sector and Infosys in particular. But, you know, I guess it is being pulled along as one of the index heavyweights. So those are my brief thoughts about big caps and the New Year.

What is the sense that you get for 2024? Does one need to be extra cautious this year? Given that the fundamentals of the economy are so strong, should one not get too worried?
Pashupati Advani: I have always been a little bit behind the curve and a little bit on the conservative side, simply because I believe there is still a lot of doom and gloom happening outside India. I am sure that some of it is going to come on to us. So far, it has been rosy and people have been enjoying it. Movies are doing well, everything, all leisure is doing well.

But, overseas, what I am hearing is that people are going out but the spending is lower. People are holidaying less, air flights are coming down. So, some of that has to come to us. And it may take three, four months or five months, but then again, we have our elections, and we are all presuming that Modi ji will come back and then it will be off to the races again. But I am cautiously optimistic.

Could 2024 be a year of big reversal for private sector banks? Sunil Subramaniam answers

We definitely need to be in the strong sectors, which are things like infrastructure, where the government is really focusing. And of course, the public sector enterprises and utilities and banks are also doing well. So those are the ones that one should ride on and we will probably make some good money this first half of 2024.

What is your take on the public sector space because, of course, 2023 was a rerating year of sorts, time to take some profits off the table here or do you see this as just the beginning of the cycle?
Pashupati Advani: Well, two things I am seeing with public sector companies. One is that the ones that are doing well are going to be good dividend payers. I think that we will see them declaring interim dividends in February and March for this year. That is good. We have seen it in the past with good performers like REC. And the other thing about public sector companies is, obviously, the government is investing in infrastructure and they are giving that business to public sector companies so that they keep it within the family, as they say.

It is a trend that the public sector is driving the boost in the economy so that it can create jobs and things like that. One should be bullish on those enterprises. Plus, the government will probably sell some off in the secondary markets. Some of them are even looking interesting to buy at these levels because I am presuming the government will want to sell at higher levels. In the same breath, you can look at Vodafone Idea, which is also a quasi-public sector company because the government has about 30% odd, which they took in lieu of the debt, around Rs 10. That is now worth Rs 17. I would not be surprised if we see some of those shares also in the market sooner rather than later.

Two months after the woman student was allegedly gang-raped inside the IIT-BHU campus, police arrested three men on Sunday and opposition parties alleged that they were BJP functionaries. The three accused claimed themselves to be the BJP's IT cell members on their Facebook page.

""Women and children are being raped in Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. To tell the general public how incidents like rape are being carried out under their patronage, our Banaras district and city unit will gherao the prime minister's Varanasi office on Tuesday,"" Rai said on Monday.

He claimed that Kunal Pandey, the convenor of BJP's IT cell in Varanasi, its working committee member Abhishek Chauhan and co-convenor Saksham Patel were sent to the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections so that they could not be arrested.

""Had they been arrested before the elections, the message would have gone to the entire country that these three BJP officials are rapists,"" the Congess' Uttar Pradesh unit chief said, adding that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath should tell when bulldozers will run on the houses of these accused.

He alleged, ""The BJP is a party of rapists. In this, there are rapist leaders like Kuldeep Sengar and Swami Chinmayanand. The BJP is working to save rapists.""

The gang rape took place on the night of November 1. Following the incident, hundreds of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) students held a protest on the campus and demanded that the entry of outsiders be banned.

According to the complainant, she had gone out of her hostel with a friend on the night of November 1. They were near the Karman Baba temple when three men came there on a motorcycle, forcibly took her to a corner and gagged her after separating her from her friend.

The accused then allegedly stripped the woman, made a video of her and clicked photos. They let her go after about 15 minutes and took her phone number, the complainant stated.

Based on the complaint, an FIR was registered under IPC Section 354 (assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and under provisions of the Information Technology Act at Lanka police station.

Subsequently, the charge of gang rape was added to the FIR, police said. Three people -- Kunal Pandey, Anand alias Abhishek Chauhan, and Saksham Patel -- have been arrested in the case.

Opposition parties targeted the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath-led government over the law and order situation in the state and alleged that those arrested in the case have links with the ruling BJP.

Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said in a post on X that those arrested for gang-raping the woman student are part of a new crop of BJP workers thriving under the patronage of senior leaders.

ABVP state media coordinator Abhinav Mishra, in a statement however, demanded that police file a charge sheet in the case at the earliest and also take action against those who protected the accused for two months. The ABVP also called on the BHU administration to take appropriate steps to ensure the safety of everyone on the campus.

A tsunami around 1 meter high hit parts of the Sea of Japan's west coast, with a larger wave anticipated, according to NHK. Japan faced a series of 21 earthquakes, each registering a magnitude of more than 4, within a brief 90-minute period.

The Japan Meteorological Agency issued tsunami warnings for Ishikawa, Niigata, and Toyama prefectures. Top government spokesperson Hayashi Yoshimasa urged residents to prepare for potential further quakes as authorities assessed the damage.

The strong earthquake tsunami in central and western Japan on Monday, prompted evacuation warnings, power outages, and transportation disruptions. Tsunami warnings were issued for Ishikawa, Niigata, and Toyama prefectures, and Russia issued warnings for Vladivostok and Nakhodka. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida urged residents to stay alert for possible aftershocks and evacuate where tsunamis were expected. The earthquake disrupted power, high-speed rail, and telecom services in affected regions. No irregularities were reported at nuclear power plants.

NHK footage showed buildings collapsing in Ishikawa, and tremors were felt in Tokyo. Over 36,000 households lost power in Ishikawa and Toyama. Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority reported no irregularities at nuclear plants along the Sea of Japan. The 2011 earthquake and tsunami in northeastern Japan resulted in significant casualties, town devastation, and nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima.

A government spokesperson said there were reports of destruction of some houses due to the earthquake and authorities are still in the process of assessing the full extent of the damage. Some roads in the affected region were reported to have developed major cracks.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishid urged the residents to remain alert and prepare for possible aftershocks.

The widespread impact of the earthquake extended to utilities and transportation. Over 36,000 households lost power in Ishikawa and Toyama prefectures, with utility provider Hokuriku Electric Power reporting the disruptions. High-speed rail services to Ishikawa were suspended, and telecom operators Softbank and KDDI reported service disruptions in Ishikawa and Niigata.

Airlines have cancelled many flights to the affected region due to airport closure. Despite the seismic activity, Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority provided assurance that no irregularities had been observed at nuclear power plants in the region. (With Agency Inputs)

Walmart and Target will maintain regular hours, welcoming customers on January 1st. However, Costco warehouses will remain closed throughout the day.

CVS Pharmacy outlets typically operate with standard hours on New Year’s Day, although certain non-24 locations might have reduced timings. Walgreens will be open, yet pharmacy hours might vary across locations. Starbucks may also have fluctuating hours based on business requirements.

Numerous other prominent chains are expected to operate on New Year’s Day, including Albertsons, Home Depot, IKEA, Jewel-Osco, Kroger, Lowe’s, Macy’s, Meijer, Rite Aid, Safeway, Sheetz, and 7-Eleven. While most stores will maintain regular hours, specific services such as pharmacy operations might experience variations in select outlets.

Bong Joon-ho's 'Parasite' was a stinging satire on class divides in South Korea and etched history in 2020 when it became the first non-English film to win an Academy Award for best picture. It also bagged three more Oscars, including best director trophy for Bong.

Cho played Choi Yeon-gyo, the Park family matriarch, opposite Lee, who essayed the role of Park Dong-ik, the Park family head, in the genre-defying movie.

The actress shared a throwback selfie on Instagram on Monday with Lee and other 'Parasite' co-stars Choi Woo-shik and Park Myung-hoon from an awards show.

""I will never forget the honour of being together (with you). I will never forget (your) cheerfulness of always making everyone smile. I will be a warm and good actor like you. I'll embrace a new year that is not pleasant. I'll try to do well,"" she wrote in the caption.

Lee, 48, was found dead last Wednesday in Seoul by South Korean authorities following up a report that he had gone missing.

The actor had faced investigation over accusations of illegal drug use amid a government crackdown in which police questioned him three times, with one session running 19 hours over the weekend.

Lee had said he was tricked into taking drugs by a bar hostess trying to blackmail him, the Yonhap news agency reported.

The actor is also known for Koreans films such as 'Helpless' and 'All About My Wife' as well as K-dramas 'Coffee Prince' and 'My Mister'. Lee was nominated for best actor International Emmy for his titular role in Apple TV+'s first Korean-language original series 'Mr Brain'.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/2023-as-india-gasps-for-breath-ngt-cracks-whip-to-spur-authorities-strive-for-cleaner-air-water/articleshow/106453856.cms,"New Delhi: As large swathes of India gasped for breath, choking on air laden with contaminants, the National Green Tribunal grappled with a wide range of environmental issues, including pollution of the Ganga and quality and quantity of groundwater and air pollution in 2023. It went to the extent of imposing huge penalties on states like Delhi and Bihar for poor liquid and solid waste management. In February, the tribunal directed the Delhi government to pay Rs 2,232 crore as environmental compensation for improper management of solid and liquid waste, while in May it imposed a staggering Rs 4,000 crore compensation on Bihar.

The green panel also passed orders to check over-exploitation of natural resources.

It took suo motu (on its own) cognisance of industrial and environmental disasters, and awarded compensation to the victims.

A highlight of the tribunal's directions involved restoring the pristine sanctity of rivers, many of which are venerated entities like the Ganga and Yamuna. Express orders were passed for not discharging sewage into the rivers and for protecting the floodplains.

Acknowledging the pressing issue of pollution of the Ganga and its tributaries in West Bengal, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand, the NGT sought a report from each district from the District Ganga Protection Committees headed by the District Magistrate across the five states.

While dealing with complaints about encroachment and pollution of water bodies, the tribunal directed the authorities concerned to restore them to their original form.

The tribunal observed that nearly all states and Union Territories (UTs) were yet to bridge the gap between sewage generation and treatment. It noted the estimates which said around 30,000 million litres per day (MLD) of sewage was still left untreated.

The reasons for improper liquid waste management included non-utilisation of the installed capacity of Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs), lack of household sewage connections and treated sewage getting mixed with untreated sewage in drains, the tribunal noted.

Underscoring that legacy waste dumped across cities was like a ""ticking time bomb"", the tribunal ordered their remediation through biomining and other measures. Biomining involves an environmentally friendly technique to separate soil and recyclable material like plastic, metal, paper, textile, construction and demolition waste from legacy waste.

A major initiative of the tribunal launched during the year was monitoring the gaps in solid and liquid waste across states and UTs, and imposing environmental compensation on deficient stakeholders.

On May 21, the green panel concluded its proceedings on solid and liquid waste management by all states and UTs, and said the way forward is to accord high priority to the subject and ensure strict monitoring.

The tribunal determined a total compensation of Rs 79,234.36 crore and asked the states and UTs concerned to keep the amount in a separate ring-fenced account which was to be used for restoration measures.

It adjudicated matters on the use of groundwater by stadiums and groundwater contamination in Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur and Sangrur in Punjab, noting their quality and falling levels across 27 states, and the need for replenishment by rainwater harvesting.

The tribunal flagged natural disasters, as reported in Joshimath (Uttarakhand), and heard matters relating to cracks in houses, roads and other infrastructure in the state, besides those in Jammu and Kashmir's Doda. It also took note of such damage caused in Uttarakand's Mussoorie and ordered measures for prevention of environmental damage in the wider Himalayan region.

It asked the authorities concerned to assess the carrying capacity of pilgrim centres in Uttarakhand, including the famous 'Chardham'-Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri- to sustain tourism load and evolve an environment management plan.

In ecological terms, the phrase carrying capacity means the number of people, animals, or crops which a region can support without environmental degradation.

The tribunal also gave impetus to wildlife protection and directed sanctuaries to notify their boundaries to prevent encroachment.

During the year, it passed directions for protecting the Soor Sarovar bird sanctuary in Agra and Dhanauri Saras sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh.

The tribunal, on its own, took up the Air Quality Index (AQI) management issues in the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) and across several states.

It directed the chief secretaries of the states where the AQI had dipped to poor, very poor and severe categories to take immediate remedial action.

The tribunal emphasised the need for having an advance action plan to curb stubble burning.

Underscoring that the ""psychological aspect"" of the dip in the air quality in the national capital required to be examined, the NGT sought replies from government authorities, including the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi.

According to data available on the NGT website, the tribunal, across all its benches, settled 27,115 matters.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/ongc-seeks-partners-to-cut-gas-flaring-zero-methane-emission-by-2030/articleshow/106453997.cms,"New Delhi, India's top oil and gas producer ONGC is seeking global technology partners to cut gas flaring and achieve zero methane emission by 2030 as part of its ambitious decarbonisation plan, its chairman Arun Kumar Singh said on Monday.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has substantially cut gas flaring -- burning of methane gas that is produced when oil is extracted from below surface -- and would look to bring it down to nil as part of its environmental commitments.

In a post on LinkedIn, Singh said India's role in the global energy landscape is progressively becoming pivotal, and is likely to account for 25 per cent of global energy demand growth over the next two decades.

According to the International Energy Agency, India's share in global primary energy consumption is expected to rise to 9.8 per cent by 2050.

""India's share in cumulative global green-house-gas (GHG) emissions has been only 4 per cent, and current emission is 7 per cent, despite its population share of 16-17 per cent,"" he said. ""As a responsible corporate citizen of the world, we are fully aware of our obligation towards the mother planet, which is shared by developing and developed world alike. Accordingly, our nation is chasing a paradigm shift in energy consumption, with a focus on cleaner, greener, and sustainable alternatives.""

With increasing energy demand, the commitment to decarbonisation is stronger than ever.

""ONGC has made significant contributions in reducing gas flaring in our exploration and production (E&P) operations, aligning with our environmental commitments; we have consistently worked to bring it lower and lower, and we aim to bring avoidable flaring down to zero by 2030.

""Similarly, substantive reduction has been achieved in the area of methane emission, and we aim to bring it down to zero level by 2030,"" he said.

Singh said ONGC uses a lot of gas to generate electricity as well as meet compression and other process needs of an oil and gas field. By 2028, this gas is intended to be replaced with green power wheeled to installations as far as 160 km from the west coast. The gas thus freed will be sold to industries like fertiliser and power plants.

""We envisage to wheel green electricity to our Mumbai Offshore fields on the Arabian Sea, replacing natural gas, currently being used to drive power devices at process platforms,"" he said.

Companies around the globe have pledged to slash down methane emissions by 30 per cent from 2020 levels by 2030. Methane, which is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, tends to leak into the atmosphere.

This is sometimes deliberate when companies flare the gas that comes alongside crude oil, due to lack of consumption markets. It also can leak undetected from drill sites, gas pipelines and other oil and gas equipment.

Controlling methane, which has been rising in atmospheric concentration for decades, is seen as one of the easiest and cheapest ways to make an immediate impact on global greenhouse gas emissions.

""Collaboration and innovation are the key here. Realising this need, we extend an invitation to all the innovators offering superior technology and are ahead on the learning curve relating to this goal of nil methane emission and zero avoidable flaring,"" he said.

He went on to ask technology innovators to write to ONGC on possible solutions to the flaring and methane emission problem.

Flaring, which used to be done in the past because of lack of customers for gas, has been reduced by almost 80 per cent, he said.

Crude oil pumped out of ground can easily be transported in trucks but to take gas from remote well locations to industries requires pipelines.

Sometimes, the amount of gas coming out with oil is so low that laying a pipeline becomes uneconomical.

ONGC used to flare 14-15 million standard cubic metres per day, but this has now come down to around 2 per cent.

Gas flaring reduction and zero methane emissions are part of ONGC's decarbonisation drive which will also see the company putting up 10 gigawatt of plants to generate electricity from solar and wind, and constructing a 1 million tonnes per annum green ammonia plant on the west coast.

ONGC is also looking at setting pump storage projects at river dams to meet electricity demand at night when solar power cannot be generated. It will also set up compressed biogas plants to convert agri waste into gas that can be used to generate electricity, make fertiliser or turned into CNG to run automobiles.

The company, which accounts for about two-thirds of India's oil production and about 58 per cent of gas, plans to invest Rs 2 lakh crore on clean energy projects to meet its 2038 net-zero carbon emissions goal.

High pressure gas valued at Rs 816.08 crore was flared in Mumbai High field -- the mainstay fields of ONGC -- during 2012-20, according to a CAG report released in December 2021.

During 2012-13 to 2019-20, a total of 1,227.343 million metric standard cubic metres of high pressure gas valued at Rs 1,021.08 crore was flared, according to the CAG report.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/masood-azhar-kandhahar-hijacker-killed-unknown-man-trending-again-in-india/articleshow/106452829.cms,"'Unknown men' is trending again on X (formerly Twitter) on New Year. This time it is trending with the name of Kandahar hijacker Masood Azhar. As per unverified trend posts, Masood Azhar was killed this morning at 5 AM in a bomb blast when he was going back from Bhawalpur mosque in Pakistan. A video of the bomb blast is also going viral on social media along with the post.

This comes amid a spate of attacks in Pakistan against terror operatives wanted in India. Recently, the Unknown men and poison were also trending on social media along with rumors about the death of India's another most wanted, Dawood Ibrahim.

Azahar is wanted in India in cases related to the 2001 Parliament attack. He is also alleged to be associated with attacks including the targeting of the Ram Janambhoomi temple in Ayodhya on July 5, 2005, and the infamous Pulwama attack on CRPF troopers on February 14, 2019. Additionally, he orchestrated an assault on the Indian Consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif in Balk, Afghanistan, on January 3, 2016. Azhar also believed to maintained a close association with Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden and the founder of the Taliban, Mullah Omar.

Nearly two dozen terrorists or most wanted have been killed in Pakistan and across the world in the past couple of months under suspicious circumstances. Among the terrorists who have been killed in Canada and Pakistan are Abdul Salam Bhuttavi, the deputy of Laskhar-e-Taiba chief Hafeez Saeed, Hardeep Singh Nijjar based in Canada and the leader of the banned Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF), Shahid Latif, a close associate of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) chief Masood Azhar, and his brother Haris Hashim.

The method of operation involves assaults carried out by unidentified assailants using vehicles, often motorcycles, who fire numerous bullets into the bodies of their targets. Despite the connection of three individuals arrested in Nepal to the suspected ISI agent's death, none of the perpetrators have been identified or apprehended by Pakistan's security agencies.

Canara Rebecco Emerging and Tata Large and Mid Cap funds finished with about 18 to 20% return. So the dispersion is not as much as in the large cap, but still a 14, 15% difference between the top two and the bottom two, in spite of being in the same category.”

Clearly mid cap and small caps have been a hero but we also have to dissect the kind of strategies and stock picking that fund managers have done. We are just analysing one year's performance. This discussion theme does not mean that the funds which have not done really well, you need to exit those funds. I think let us start with the large cap category.
: You are absolutely right that there are funds which have done very well. It has been a very eventful year. If you look at Nifty, it does not tell the full story. But the broader markets tell you a big story from a sector divergence perspective also. Some sectors have done phenomenally well. Some sectors have not done so well. You see cement, infrastructure and capital goods doing phenomenally well. On the other hand, IT, banking have not done superbly in terms of the full calendar year. It has been a very eventful year. But the headlines hide more than they show.


This is just on the basis of past performance. It is a very easy task because it is very clerical in nature. But I will tell you the two best ones for the calendar year have been Nippon India Large Cap and HDFC Top 100. They have delivered about 27% and 24%, respectively. On the lower side, the worst ones have been in the same category, Axis Blue Chip and LICMF Large Cap Fund. Both these have given returns in the range of 13% odd, which is half the return of the best one, which is Nippon Large Cap, which is 27%. So, two misses, two worst ones for the year, of course, not from a prospective standpoint but retrospective standpoint, this is where it stands.


If you look at our model portfolio, Axis Blue Chip was a part of it. In May 2021, if I remember right, we exited this fund, lock, stock and barrel battle for our clients because it was from a future standpoint, we a couple of years back knew that this is going to be laggard. So that was out of our model portfolio. It did very well and did justice to investors' monies, but not for the last couple of years. God was kind that we got a great exit from our model portfolio.


Yes, you have pointed me in the right direction. It has value. Prashant Jain, who is no longer the CIO of HDFC MF had inculcated over the last couple of decades of his being the CIO, a value principle for all the schemes. When he had actually moved out, we analysed whether all schemes consistently follow a value principle. And most of the portfolios were cheaper in terms of value with their peers. So value is an ingrained DNA for HDFC. And the last couple of years, value has played out.

HDFC has done phenomenally well, undoing the previous five years’ underperformance in several categories. So yes, the value played out beautifully. And Nippon Large Cap is not so much of a value fund but their agility has been good. If you look at Nifty itself, there are three stocks above 100 PE, 11 stocks above 50 PE, whereas the overall PE of Nifty is 20, 21. That implies there is divergence in performance in the Nifty 50 stocks itself. And that is the divergence Nippon has capitalized on to remain number one for some time now from the last couple of years.


These are only on the basis of past performance. So from a future standpoint, I might have something else in the radar, but Motilal Oswal Large and Mid Cap is the one which has been the best for the calendar year so far, 34.5% and in large cap, HDFC Large and Mid Cap is the one with 32.8%. Canara Robeco Emerging and Tata Large and Mid Cap funds with about 18 to 20% return. So the dispersion is not as much as in the large cap, but still a 14, 15% difference between the top two and the bottom two, in spite of being in the same category.


In a year like this one, large and mid cap is going to outperform large cap because there has been a broader market rally unlike the last few years. If the broader market rally continues, which is likely if governance or government continues, mid cap and the broader market should continue the performance. This category has a large potential with a 90% chance to beat the largecap standalone.


In the midcap category, Nippon India Growth has been the best one with 42.67% and JM Mid Cap is another one with about 42% return. The worst one again, from Axis stable is Axis Mid Cap and PGIM India Mid Cap are the two worst funds for the calendar year 2023. It clearly indicates that if you look at the returns between the third category, it is significantly different and larger in mid cap and you would have noticed that we also went very bullish on large and small, mid cap and small cap on your show.


See mid cap as a category, of course, the fund manager is very important. The CIO is very important. Of course, Manish Gunwani was the CIO till sometime back before we moved on to Bandhan Mutual Fund. But Sailesh Rajbhan, who is now the CIO of Nippon has been with the same company for about 20 years. They have had a very good principle of bottom up stock picking which is very important in the mid cap space and also have had the courage to implement out of the box ideas in their portfolio. So courage and bottom-up stock picking is what I would at least attribute this performance to.


Axis has a very different story. It went into a redemption cycle, which automatically means that the stocks which they own, they have to sell. And when an institution sells in a mid cap space, they have a large impact cost. So when liquidity dries up in the stocks which you are there and you are trying to sell and you do not get those block deals, so you sell it on the screen, you incidentally spiral your own stocks down.

I think that the redemption vicious cycle has definitely impacted Axis’s performance because if a fund manager is getting net redemption every day, he or she is not going to be managing too much money but worrying about how to create the liquidity. You do not have fresh money to allocate to newer ideas but you are just wondering how to exit and pay back the redemptions which are coming. That is what unfortunately happened to Axis at least for this year or the last one more specifically.


Yes, on January 2, 2023, we went hammer and tongs on smallcaps on your show as well. If I remember the date right. It was very apparent to the naked eye that for the previous five years leaving 2023, small caps underperformed Nifty by 4.87% compounded for five big years and that is not a usual phenomenon. Whenever such a phenomenon happens, we see that was a calm before the storm and that is when we went from 5-7% in our model portfolio to as much as 30%, increasing the weight four times of small cap and that played out and that was visible to naked eye or was writing on the wall.

It was not something we claim credit for because that was easy to spot and that has panned out and 50% return is not very unusual. 2017 was another year. 2014 was another year. So every three, four, five years, smallcaps give a catchup and a mean reversion. That is what has happened and in that space, smaller funds have been able to capitalize and use this agility for themselves. So Mahindra Manulife Small Cap Fund and Franklin India Small Cap Fund have done beautifully with 50% and 47% return approximately respectively. SBI Small Cap has underperformed significantly and has only a 24% return. This one is a surprise to me because SBI should have spotted this rally. I think a little degree of pessimism in the fund manager with respect to small cap itself has resulted in them being in the bottom two and PGIM Small Cap Fund is also a small fund which had the opportunity to take advantage of this broader market rally which they have missed out.


Yes, R Janakiraman is the fund manager of Franklin India Small Cap Fund, of course, he is a great fund manager. And the kind of fund manager stability which helps a person identify a scheme itself because if there is a person who has been managing a fund for long periods of time, especially over a decade, the predictive analytics help you understand the behavioural patterns of which fund will do well in which cycle.

So, in Franklin Small Companies Fund, Jankiraman has done a great job of getting this and it is basically fund manager stability and experience in the same segment of the market. The same fund manager operating the same small cap fund brings in a lot of learning and self correction, which is what Franklin is all about. Jankiraman is a great fund manager who has recently been promoted to CIO as well.


This question would have been very easy to answer in 2017 because it was only domestic liquidity which was chasing these stocks. But today the landscape is so different, it just amazes me. We still define them as mid cap and small cap but the same English words are being used to articulate what we are trying to refer to. But they are very, very different segments. India's smallcap, the largest stock in the NSE Small Cap 250 is a 50,000 crore market cap today, which is by any stretch of imagination, if some of you were to ask somebody what is the size of a small cap, he was definitely going to tell you 10,000-12,000 crore.

He is going to tell you that kind of number, but at Rs 50,000 crores give or take is the largest, largest stock. And if you look at the second largest stock in NSE Small Cap 250, it is about 35,000-40,000 KPIT. Suzlon is the top stock in NSE Small Cap 250. So the point I am trying to make is that they can’t still be smallcap by any stretch of imagination, a $3-4 billion company is not small cap. But be it as it may, the definitions do not change so easily.

I am sure the regulator will redefine it in a more broad-based fashion. But should somebody own it or should he sell it? Should he book profits? I personally think there is some more rally left for sure because the kind of global money which is chasing Indian small caps is not funny. In 2015 to 2018, the number of FIIs in the smaller companies was negligible. Today, you see small companies having FII exposures, which are at least in number very, very astronomically high.

If the foreigner is playing the India story using the small cap space, what kind of PE ratings have we currently seen? Will you again see a de-rating? I think unlikely, because if the election mandate is to the same government, which capital markets love, you will see huge more rally because foreign monies are not just participating in Nifty, they are participating in even a small stock of 5000 crore market cap, which was not the case in 2018. So do not sell and drop your hat so soon, is the point I am trying to make.


Yes, like you rightly pointed out, you leave me no point, which is actually a great thing. So I get a breather. JM Flexi Cap and Parag Parekh Flexi Cap, of course, their large cap exposures have been smaller relative to the average. I think that has played out beautifully. Again, Axis Flexi Cap and UTI Flexi Cap with a larger large cap exposure, are closer to the Nifty performance than the mid cap and small cap performance.

So in a flexi cap, the call of having the right proportion is also as critical as having the right stock in the specific sector and the sector itself. So in flexi caps, because of the kind of flexible mandate it possesses, as the name suggests, the fund managers are able to create a larger difference. Now, if you see the difference, it is more than twice that 35% is the largest best fund and the worst one is 16%.

This tells you the disparity in this category is more, larger the flexibility, larger is the disparity, larger is the need to pick the right fund. And that is where your distributor comes into picture, to be able to get you closer to the 35% than the 16%.


Yes, HDFC Multi Cap is the best performer in terms of the multi cap category. If you look at Nippon India Multi Cap, that has also done beautifully. SBI Multi Cap is again in the worst category of the last two, Quant Active is another worse fund, it is about just 19%. I can definitely spare Quant for its bad performance because there was just some degree of mean reversion. It has delivered such stupendous returns for the previous three, four years that it had the right to actually take a little breather and relax. And that's what Quant has done. It is not a systemic change in performance. It is just a structural mean reversion.


Yes, multicap is reasonably restrictive because in a multicap category, the fund manager needs to have one fourth in each of these categories, large, mid and small, only the 25% is at the discretion, the disparity is largely because where he used the other 25% and also the stock picking and the sector picking skill of the fund manager. Last year, has been a great year in terms of divergent sector performance and divergent stock performance and divergent segment performance.

On all the three dimensions of the equity market, we have seen very large disparities. There is a difference between a great fund manager and an okay one, and that became more apparent in a year like last year. If everything is doing well, you cannot spot the best guy. If everything is doing badly, you cannot spot the best guy. If there is divergence of this quantum on all dimensions, that is when you can know what mettle each of them have and HDFC has proved that. And so has Nippon.


Yes, aggressive hybrid funds. Again, here you see the divergence because aggressive hybrids also give you a lot of flexibility to the fund manager. Here you see one fund which has delivered 32% return, 31.77%, which is Bank of India Mid Cap and Small Cap and Debt Fund. And there is another fund, which is an Axis Hybrid Fund, which has given 11%.

So the difference between the worst one and the largest one is 20%, almost three times more is what the best one has given in relation to the worst one. So more the flexibility, more is the divergence of performance that hypothesis gets proved in this category even further.

And Axis again appears here the third time in the worst category and none have so far appeared in the best category. Again, substantiates why because they had gotten into a redemption cycle, which they have not been able to break through after the little fiasco they had in terms of the news and exigencies they had in their business.


Balanced Advantage, again, has fared okay. Balanced Advantage is largely pointed towards a retail investor who is not doing asset allocation at his level and wants to delegate this responsibility of asset allocation to a fund manager..."

Bhopal-based Nisarg nursery owner Ramkumar Rathore said his facility has received orders for the flowers and they have already dispatched two consignments each of 10,000 flowers to Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh.

More than one lakh devotees are expected to descend on Ayodhya to mark the occasion of 'pran pratishtha' (consecration) of Lord Ram on January 22.

""We have received orders from Ayodhya's Ram Janmabhoomi to provide five-six varieties of flowers. These include various colours of bougainvillea including white, orange, red and yellow,"" Rathore said.

The flowers of these species bloom in all seasons. They do not need much care and can be maintained with less quantity of water, he said.

The Rathore family-owned nursery won the order for supplying the flowers following a bidding process for the plantation at the Ram temple premises and its corridor.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/stop-weaponising-technology-congress-slams-govt-over-aadhaar-based-system-in-mgnrega-payments/articleshow/106451030.cms,"New Delhi: With an Aadhaar-based system reportedly becoming mandatory for MGNREGA payments, the Congress on Monday said the Modi government should ""stop weaponising technology"", especially Aadhaar, to deny the most vulnerable Indians their social welfare benefits. The opposition party also condemned it and alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""well-known disdain for MGNREGA has translated into a slew of experiments designed to use technology as a weapon to exclude"".

In a statement, Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said the fifth extension of the deadline set by the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) to mandate the payments for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) through the Aadhaar-Based Payment System (ABPS) ended on December 31, 2023.

""There are in total 25.69 crore MGNREGA workers of whom 14.33 crore are considered as active workers. As on December 27, 34.8 per cent of total registered workers (8.9 crore) and 12.7 per cent of active workers (1.8 crore) are still ineligible for ABPS,"" Ramesh said.

Despite many challenges highlighted by workers, practitioners and researchers in using ABPS for MGNREGA wage payments, the Modi government has continued with its ""destructive experiments with technology"", he said.

""This is prime minister's cruel new year gift to exclude crores of the poorest and marginalised Indians from earning a basic income,"" he alleged.

Ramesh pointed out that a statement issued by the MoRD dated August 30, 2023, made certain questionable claims such as job cards will not be deleted on the basis that the worker is not eligible for APBS and that different ""stakeholders"" in certain ""consultations"" have found ABPS as the best route for making wage payment.

It also claimed that ABPS helps workers get their wage on time and avoids transaction rejections, Ramesh noted.

""First, since April 2022, an alarming 7.6 crore registered workers were deleted from the system. 1.9 crore registered workers were deleted from the system nine months into the current financial year. Ground verification of deleted workers has shown that a significant number of deletions have been wrongfully done -- as a result of the tearing hurry of the Modi government to implement Aadhaar authentication and ABPS,"" he alleged.

Ramesh said the ministry must clarify who these ""stakeholders"" were and when these consultations were held.

""In fact, the Modi government has turned a deaf ear to the multiple concerns from numerous delegations on the implementation of ABPS and other technological interventions,"" he claimed.

""The MoRD's claims regarding the increase in payment efficiency with the ABPS, which remain unsubstantiated, have been thoroughly debunked by a LibTech India working paper. The study analysed 3.2 crore wage transactions to demonstrate that there is no statistically significant difference in the time taken to process account and Aadhaar based payments by the Union government,"" he said.

The working paper also shows that the difference in rejection rates between ABPS and the account-based payments is statistically negligible, he added.

""The PM's well-known disdain for MGNREGA has translated into a slew of experiments designed to use technology as a weapon to exclude -- such as the digital attendance (NMMS), ABPS, drone monitoring and the proposed integration of facial recognition to NMMS,"" Ramesh alleged.

No due consultation or scientific piloting was done before unleashing these experiments on crores of Indians, he claimed.

""The Indian National Congress reiterates its demand of August 30, 2023, that the Modi government should stop weaponising technology, especially Aadhaar to deny the most vulnerable Indians their social welfare benefits, release delayed wage payments and implement open muster rolls and social audits to improve transparency,"" Ramesh said in his statement.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/what-is-going-to-be-the-big-trend-in-2024-rajeev-mantri-explains/articleshow/106451627.cms,"Rajeev Mantri, MD, Navam Capital, says “ Indian markets have been the best in the world for listings and IPOs. That is a very encouraging development. In fact, in a way, it closes the loop for the VC, PE sort of industry where there was always a question as to whether it would be possible to list new-age companies. If they would list, would they trade? Would there be an appetite in the retail segment, in the mutual fund segment for companies of this type? All those questions have been answered in the affirmative by market action over the last two years.”


How do you think 2024 is going to be different from 2023, especially in the unlisted and private market because 2023 was marred by a bit of a winter in terms of the funding winter that we have been talking about? There have been a lot of layoffs at many companies. How do you see 2024 to pan out for these companies?
Rajeev Mantri: The last 18 months obviously saw a bit of a pullback from a very frothy period that we saw in 2021 and probably the first half of 2022. But I do think that much of this has played out now and in the coming 12 to 18 months, we will see a pickup in activity in aggregate when we look at private investment in the VC, PE categories.

What is very heartening is the geographical spread of entrepreneurship in India has really widened and there is a certain breadth of sectors which have come to the fore. So, I do think that the startup India phenomenon is getting more momentum and the next one or two years are going to be really-really landmark years.

But the year gone by was a landmark year for IPOs and the kind of exits that we saw from PE and VC investors as well in the sense of the lock-in period ending, a lot of block deals happening, how do you expect 2024 to play out in that respect?
Rajeev Mantri: By all accounts, Indian markets have been the best in the world for listings and IPOs. That is a very encouraging development. In fact, in a way, it closes the loop for the VC, PE sort of industry where there was always a question as to whether it would be possible to list new-age companies. If they would list, would they trade? Would there be an appetite in the retail segment, in the mutual fund segment for companies of this type?

I think all those questions have been answered in the affirmative by market action over the last two years. Yes, of course, there have been certain companies listed at a very high valuation, they have seen a significant pull-down, but this is par for the course. We should accept that there will be certain excesses on both sides and the takeaway really is that capital markets are open for new-age companies and listings of new-age companies.

I want to specifically talk about one of your investments and that is Ather Energy. Of course, the entire energy transition and electric vehicle theme has played out beautifully in the year gone by. But this year, the Street is watching out for the IPO of Ola Electric in that sense. For the EV ecosystem, what are the big factors to watch out for as we head into 2024?
Rajeev Mantri: This year saw a fair bit of churn on the policy side. So, the FAME scheme was kind of rejigged. There were some questions about value addition from certain of the EV manufacturers. The consolidation which was coming in the industry got accelerated and has kind of happened now or is happening faster than expected.

So, EV penetration in India continues to be fairly low. I think the government policy at a higher level is very clear that they would like to reduce dependence on oil imports and electrification of vehicles both four wheelers and two wheelers as necessary for that. I do think the government will keep pushing that point and some of the players who are emerging from this sort of consolidation period will do very well in the coming years.

What is going to be the big trend in 2024 – be it AI or something else? Which are the latest pitch books that you are getting or something that has been very interesting and intriguing for you as the next big trend to watch out for?
Rajeev Mantri: The integration between hardware and software where companies are developing products which combine elements of both. So, the products that combine elements of hardware and software innovation to build something unique, offer something truly novel to fulfill the customer needs. That is a trend which is picking up now and the rise of frontier tech and deep tech innovation in India is really encouraging in that regard because we always had these capabilities in the country and now we are finding that our engineers, our technologists are actually creating products in these industries and getting traction in terms of customers paying for these products whether it is enterprise, whether it is government.

I just want to get back to the IPO point because some of your portfolio companies might also be looking at coming into the secondary market via the IPO action. Could you talk to us a bit more about that? Which are the listings that are anticipated?
Rajeev Mantri: We have three or four companies which are in IPO track now. In fact, probably some of them would list in the US, some would list in India. I do not want to talk about any company specifically but yes, we do have three or four companies that are looking to go public and like I said, the Indian markets are offering some of the best kind of traction for new-age companies and there has never been a better time for being an entrepreneur in the country and that is I think a terrific sort of development.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/ive-moved-on-from-lifetime-captaincy-ban-enjoyed-ipl-leadership-stints-david-warner/articleshow/106450907.cms,"Sydney: The controversy surrounding the lifetime captaincy ban on David Warner following the 2018 ball-tampering scandal could have been handled differently but he has moved on from that episode, the retiring batting stalwart said here on Monday. Warner was handed a lifetime leadership ban after team-mate Cameron Bancroft was caught with sandpaper in his trouser pocket and Australia admitted to ball-tampering during the Cape Town Test against South Africa in 2018.

Among the three cricketers who were punished -- captain Steve Smith and Bancroft being the other two --, Warner got the harshest punishment.

Following an amendment to Cricket Australia's Code of Conduct for players and staff in 2022, the left-handed batter was to appeal against the ban but later decided not to do so as he apparently found out that the review panel hearing was to be done in public.

""When I look back at that, it can be handled differently. But I think Nick (Hockley, Cricket Australia's chief executive) did his ultimate best to put that forward to the board and the decision was made, and I'm happy with that. I've moved forward from that,"" Warner said after he announced his retirement from ODI cricket alongside the end of his Test career this week.

Warner was asked if he still held any bitterness over the lifetime leadership ban and the way Cricket Australia handled the review into that.

The 37-year-old swashbuckling opener has already announced that he will retire from the longest format after the third and final Test against Pakistan starting at the SCG on Wednesday.

Warner, who has led Sunrisers Hyderabad and Delhi Capitals in the IPL, said he enjoyed his leadership stints in the lucrative T20 league.

""I've got opportunities to lead in the IPL, to lead in the ILT20. I've enjoyed my leadership roles.

""But for me, in recent years, I've learned that leadership (isn't about) wearing a captain or vice-captain badges. For me, I'm a leader in this team no matter what. You don't need that C or VC next to your name.

""I know myself and my energy at times can be annoying, and I can be a pest, but I know that inside that changeroom it gets everyone up and about.""

Asked what he had learnt from the ball-tampering scandal, he said, ""...Reflecting back on that whole period, my whole career, I've got no regrets because you are going to have a lot of hurdles you are going to have to jump.

""There's going to be obstacles in the way, but you have to move forward and I've done that with dignity.""

Warner also revealed that he was prepared to retire from Test cricket after the second match of the 2023 Ashes series at Lord's if he had not scored runs. The selectors initially named the Ashes squad only for the opening two Tests, and Warner was struggling for form then.

""I actually had Lord's pencilled in as my last Test, especially if I didn't go as well as I did in a partnership with 'Uzzie' (Usman Khawaja) at the top of the order. Then from there, it just followed on that we played some good innings together. I didn't have that hundred (in England) that I always wanted but always eluded me in achieving. But as a team and as a whole we did our bit.

""To get this ending is awesome, but it's not about me, it's about us. We've won the series (against Pakistan) but to win 3-0 and have a whitewash here at the SCG would be a great thing for the team. We can't take away the fact of how well this team has been (playing) in the last 18 months.""

About the 50-over World Cup triumph in India, he said, ""To win in India, from where we were, was absolutely amazing. Everything's just so calm and relaxed inside the team. We back ourselves to train to the best of our ability and then go out there and perform.

""There's never any added pressure. When we lost two games in a row in India (in the World Cup), the bond just got stronger with each other. It's not by fluke or by chance that we were able to get to where we were.""

He said he does not have any wishes that he could have done anything different because he has given it his best.

""A boy from a housing commission having a dream. I've not always fitted the mould, but I've been authentic and honest. I've played the exact same way. Someone who has gone out there and just given it his all,"" he said when asked how he would want to be remembered.

He picked the 2014 Test series win against South Africa as his favourite moment of his career, besides the Ashes triumphs.

His 100 in a session at the SCG against Pakistan in 2017 and the 335 not out -- also against Pakistan -- in 2019 were Warner's favourite innings.

He picked former South African fast bowler Dale Steyn as the toughest bowler he had faced in his career.

Warner also hinted more national team-mates might retire in the near future.

""It might not just be me (retiring), but no-one (else has) said anything, so I think it just is me. But it was a decision that I was very, very comfortable with.""

The brokerage remains wary of an absolute return potential of the market from the current levels as it replaces ITC and Larsen & Toubro (L&T) with Britannia and PSU stock NTPC from its concentrated All-Season portfolio.

""As per our ‘Nifty fair value’ model, the index is now close to 20% overvalued. Thus, we do not anticipate a large upside to the index from this point. The most likely outcome for the index in the next 6-9 month period seems to be a time correction,"" Kotak said in a note.

Kotak's December 2023 Concentrated All-Season portfolio consists of Nestle India, Britannia Industries, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Bajaj Auto, and NTPC. The portfolio outperformed the Nifty index with annualised returns of 22.9% versus 20.8% returns delivered by the latter. The December returns of its Concentrated All-Season portfolio were also higher at 10% versus 7.9% given by Nifty.

Out of the five stocks in this portfolio, Kotak has an ‘Add’ rating on four stocks and a ‘Sell’ rating on Bajaj Auto. The highest weight is carried by Nestle India (28.5%) followed by Britannia (23.2%), TCS (16.5%), Bajaj Auto (16.5%), and NTPC (15.3%)

December was yet another good month for factors, with only low volatility underperforming the index. Both broad and concentrated All-Season portfolios outperformed the index in December, the Kotak report said. In the 12 portfolios, only Concentrated Low Volatility, and Concentrated Momentum gave lower returns than the Nifty.

Kotak's other portfolios that gave higher annualised returns than Nifty include Broad All Season (22.8%), Broad Fundamental (23.9%), Broad Low Volatility (21.1%), Broad Momentum (24.6%), Concentrated Sentiment (42.6%), Broad Sentiment (28.7%), Concentrated anti-factor (40%), Broad anti-factor (37.9%).

Ten states and Union territories have so far detected the presence of the JN.1 sub-variant of the virus.

These states are Kerala (83), Goa (51), Gujarat (34), Karnataka (eight), Maharashtra (seven), Rajasthan (five), Tamil Nadu (four), Telangana (two) Odisha (one) and Delhi (one), according to the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG).

The INSACOG's data showed 179 Covid cases recorded in the country in December had the presence of JN.1, while 17 such cases were detected in November.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has classified JN.1 as a separate ""variant of interest"" given its rapidly-increasing spread, but said it poses a ""low"" global public health risk.

The JN.1 sub-variant of the coronavirus was previously classified as a variant of interest (VOI) as part of the BA.2.86 sub-lineages, the parent lineage that is classified as a VOI, the world body said.

However, in recent weeks, JN.1 cases continued to be reported from multiple countries and its prevalence has rapidly increased globally.

The Centre has asked the states and Union territories to maintain a constant vigil amid an uptick in the number of Covid cases and the detection of the JN.1 sub-variant in the country.

India has recorded 636 new coronavirus infections, while the active cases stood at 4,394, according to the data released by the Health ministry on Monday.

The Gujarat government's thrust to create opportunities and foster a thriving workforce is evident in its numbers and expert analysis. May be other states can adapt this model to lower their unemployment numbers, Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel said at a function recently.

Gujarat's unemployment rate of 2.2 per cent is considerably lower than the national average of 4.2 per cent, thanks to the conducive investment environment created by the government that adds to job creation, as per government data.

More than 2,700 Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) signed by investors with the state government so far in the run up to the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit to be organised from January 10 to 12 have the potential to generate around 10.91 lakh employment opportunities, the government said in a release.

The Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit has also given the state an opportunity to explore and deliberate on the issues of building a workforce for future with skills that will be required for the industry 4.0 and developing global networks for skill development.

State Labour, Skill Development and Employment Department's additional chief secretary Anju Sharma said as part of the upcoming Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit, the state government will organise a seminar on January 11 with a focus on skilling and its future for Viksit Bharat@2047, the Centre's vision to make India a developed nation by 2047.

Another seminar will deliberate on strategies to establish globally interconnected networks for skill development, with an emphasis on synthesis of cutting-edge technologies, innovative pedagogy, and international collaboration to optimise human capital for the 21st century workforce.

Saurabh Goswami, a worker at a diamond manufacturing unit in Surat, credited the Vibrant Gujarat Summit for increased employment opportunities.

""Ever since Vibrant Gujarat started, there has been a growth in the diamond industry, we are getting good salaries and the work has also increased. The state's focus on employment has significantly impacted the lives of its citizens, providing stability and growth,"" he said.

As per the government data, the percentage of placement to total registrations during the year 2021 through state employment exchanges is an impressive 84.5 per cent, a huge jump from just 33 per cent in 2004.

Chief Minister Patel said Gujarat has become the growth engine of the country under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""The Gujarat government's thrust to creating opportunities and fostering a thriving workforce is evident in its numbers and expert analysis. May be other states can adapt this model to lower their unemployment numbers,"" he said.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/petrol-diesel-sales-drop-as-winter-sets-in/articleshow/106452900.cms,"New Delhi: Petrol and diesel sales in India slumped in December as setting in of winter tapered demand, preliminary data of state-owned firms showed on Monday. Petrol sales of the three state-owned firms, which control 90 per cent of the fuel market, fell 1.4 per cent to 2.72 million tonnes in December 2023 when compared to the year-ago period, while diesel demand dropped 7.8 per cent to 6.73 million tonnes.

The onset of the winter season in northern India led to the tapering of air-conditioning demand.

Month-on-month petrol sales dropped 4.9 per cent when compared to 2.86 million tonnes consumption in November. Diesel demand too was down 0.8 per cent month-on-month when compared to 6.79 million tonnes in November.

Diesel is India's most consumed fuel, accounting for almost 40 per cent of all petroleum product consumption. Transport sector accounts for 70 per cent of all diesel sales in the country.

Fuel consumption has been on a see-saw over the last couple of months.

Demand for both petrol and diesel had risen in October but diesel consumption fell 7.5 per cent in the following month.

Consumption of petrol during December 2023 was 7.1 per cent more than in the COVID-marred December 2021 and 21.5 per cent more than in pre-pandemic December 2019.

Diesel consumption was up 4.3 per cent over December 2021 and 2.7 per cent compared to December 2019.

Jet fuel (ATF) sales rose 3.8 per cent year-on-year to 644,900 tonnes in December. But this was 6.5 per cent lower than in December 2019 primarily because not all international flights have resumed after the pandemic.

ATF consumption was 25.5 per cent more than in December 2021, but lower than 628,400 tonnes used in pre-COVID December 2019.

Month-on-month jet fuel sales were 2.6 per cent higher than 628,400 tonnes in November 2023.

Cooking gas LPG sales were almost flat year-on-year at 2.73 million tonnes in December. LPG consumption was 8.1 per cent higher than in December 2021 and 16.4 per cent more than in pre-COVID December 2019.

Month-on-month, LPG demand rose 6.2 per cent against 2.57 million tonnes of LPG consumption during November, the data showed.

However, the price of domestic LPG -- used in household kitchens for cooking purposes -- remained unchanged at Rs 903 per 14.2-kg cylinder.

Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) price was cut by Rs 4,162.5, or 3.9 per cent, in the national capital to Rs 101,993.17 per kl, according to price notifications of state-owned fuel retailers.

This is the third straight monthly reduction in jet fuel prices. ATF price was cut by almost 6 per cent (Rs 6,854.25 per kl) in November and by Rs 5,189.25, or 4.6 per cent, in December.

The three rounds of reduction have wiped away almost 45 per cent of the Rs 29,391.08 per kl increase in rates effected in four monthly tranches starting July 1.

The reduction in the price of jet fuel, which makes up for 40 per cent of an airline's operating cost, will ease the burden on already financially strained airlines.

Alongside, oil firms also reduced the price of commercial LPG - used in various establishments such as hotels and restaurants - by Rs 1.50.

A 19-kg commercial LPG cylinder will now cost Rs 1,755.50 in the national capital and Rs 1,708.50 in Mumbai.

The price hike follows a Rs 39.5 per cylinder reduction in rates effected on December 22.

State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) revise cooking gas and ATF prices on the 1st of every month, based on the average international price in the previous month. The revision on December 22 was an outlier.

Petrol and diesel prices continued to remain on freeze for a record 21st month in a row. Petrol costs Rs 96.72 per litre in the national capital, and diesel costs Rs 89.62 per litre.

State-owned fuel retailers are supposed to revise petrol and diesel prices daily, based on a 15-day rolling average of benchmark international fuel prices, but they haven't done that since April 6, 2022.

You could check on our website that tickets for one and a half hour destinations would be available for as low as Rs 3,000-3,500.”

How competitive will the airfares be for Air India Express?
Aloke Singh: I think the airfares will be competitive and really reflecting the demand and supply position of the market. But what I want to really stress on is that the fares that we offer are extremely competitive and the earlier you buy, the cheaper they are. You could check on our website that tickets for one and a half hour destinations would be available for as low as Rs 3,000-3,500. . So it depends on many factors; it depends on how early you are buying the seat, it depends on how competitive the route is, how many seats you have already sold.

Talking about the new Air India Express, we have seen a new livery. It is coming in a new form, new avatar and all from here on what are the new sectors you are looking at and how do you see the competition from definitely the incumbents in the market?
Aloke Singh: So again I think that ultimately you have to see how the market is evolving in terms of demand. We see a huge upside to the air traffic market because the economy is doing well. The air travel market in India as in other emerging countries, emerging economies is heavily leveraged to the GDP and the economy and if the GDP grows the air travel grows faster than the GDP. So we are seeing that play out and, of course, the market will be competitive because if the market is growing, if the market is booming new entrants will come in, more capacity will come in, and you can see the order book that has been placed or the orders that have been placed in the recent past we as a country I think have one of the largest fleets on order. And that shows the level of confidence that people have in the market, and that shows the level of growth that might be seen and of course the market will remain competitive.

One last thing on the route plans or maybe the plans for the coming year. What are the plans for the new routes that you plan to fly in 2024?
Aloke Singh: We are looking at a network expansion for sure. We will be strengthening our position in the domestic India market. We will remain focused on the tier two, tier three cities of the country, these are the destinations, these are the cities and towns we see as the new growth engines of the economy.

Valuation at around 19 times FY25 earnings is not so expensive, though it is not cheap. However, as part of our portfolio strategy, what we are asking our client is that it is time to take some profits off the smallcaps, micro caps and also increase your exposure to largecaps, We also believe that rather than chasing highly valued growth stocks, one has to add some distinct value stocks also to the portfolio.”

What should we be expecting in terms of the market in 2024, especially in terms of the broader market that has already seen a run-up? Do you still find value in mid and small cap names or is it time to start looking more at the largecaps now?
Gaurav Dua: So starting with the indices, I have heard this market has already gone up a lot at 18,000 levels 19,000 level, 19,500 levels and it is something which clients will keep asking you. But the point is, rather than looking at the absolute level of the indices, we need to focus on the valuation. Nifty is probably trading at 19 times FY25 earnings. So that actually is much, much, lower valuation compared to two years back. Two years back, you know, Nifty was trading at around 24 times, 25 times. So actually, in the last two years...

You were making a point in terms of the market, please do continue.
Gaurav Dua: Rather than having a look at the absolute value of Nifty, you need to look at the valuation. Valuation at around 19 times FY25 earnings is not so expensive, though it is not cheap. However, as part of our portfolio strategy, what we are asking our client is that it is time to take some profits off the smallcaps, micro caps and also increase your exposure to largecaps, number one.

Number two; we also believe that rather than chasing highly valued growth stocks, one has to add some distinct value stocks also to the portfolio.

If you could tell us about any sectors where your view is now shifting in for 2024, sectors that were overweight earlier are now underweight or sectors that were underweight earlier, are now moving towards overweight?
Gaurav Dua: As part of the multi-year up cycle in India, we have been saying for the past year, year and a half, the core investment themes are consumer, capital and the capex. That will include basically industrials, banks, financials and consumer companies. This should be part of your core holding that will also include property stocks, building material stocks.

However, what we are saying in this year is that some of the spaces which have not done well for past one, one and a half year, could have better times in this year, 2024, that would include pharmaceutical companies and two-wheeler auto companies. Third, we also believe that the IT services space should do much, much, better in 2024.

Any specific pick in the IT segment or IT sector that you would pick? Would it be from the largecap or the midcap side that you would pick?
Gaurav Dua: We will have a basket. Why we believe that IT could do this better is because the expectations are that the interest rates, especially in the US will start going down this year. So right from 2021, the IT sector started to underperform because of the interest rate hikes in the US. However, the macro part will change and IT as a space is going to do better. Within the largecap space, we will like Infosys and HCL Tech. Within the midcap space, we like Tata Technologies and Coforge."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/adani-hires-global-team-for-mumbai-slum-overhaul-project/articleshow/106447377.cms,"Adani Group-led Dharavi Redevelopment Project Pvt Ltd (DRPPL) is advancing the redevelopment of Asia's largest slum, sprawling across 600 prime acres in the heart of Mumbai. To kick start the process, the company has roped in international city and infrastructure planning experts to reimagine one of the world's largest and most dynamic informal settlements.

DRPPL has partnered with US-based interdisciplinary design firm Sasaki, UK-headquartered international consultancy firm Buro Happold and architect Hafeez Contractor for the project. Both--Sasaki and Buro Happold--renowned entities in the field of urban planning and infrastructure engineering. In addition to these, experts from Singapore have also joined the project team.

In November 2022, Adani Properties, the real estate development company owned by Gautam Adani-led Adani Group, had emerged as the highest bidder to bag the rights to redevelop the slum. While an Adani Group entity holds 80% stake in the DRPPL, the government of Maharashtra holds the balance 20% stake.

Adani Properties with its bid worth Rs 5,069 crore had emerged as the highest bidder as against the government’s stipulated minimum investment of Rs 1,600 crore that the lead partner of the special purpose vehicle (SPV) was expected to bring in.

Sasaki, with its 70-year experience, specializes in creating sustainable, integrative live-work-play environments on a global scale, while Buro Happold is known for its creative and value-driven infrastructure solutions that seamlessly blend with the environmental and social fabric of cities. Contractor is known for his social housing and Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) projects in Mumbai.

“The Dharavi Redevelopment Project is more than an urban renewal and revitalizing the infrastructure - our goal is to elevate the quality of life of the residents of Dharavi while nurturing the essence of its vibrant culture. With a commitment to integrity, inclusivity, and community engagement, we approach this pivotal endeavor with world-class excellence,” said a DRPPL spokesperson.

Singapore will serve as an inspiring example for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project. In the 1960s, Singapore’s landscape was dotted with shanties, slums and ghettos, strikingly similar to today’s Dharavi. From these modest beginnings, the Singapore Housing Development Board, since its inception in 1969, developed over 1.2 million homes.

The Singapore Housing Development Board, established in 1969, played a crucial role in meticulously crafting over 1.2 million homes, resulting in world-class integrated infrastructure and a progressive society. Drawing on the invaluable expertise gained from this journey, the Dharavi Redevelopment Project aims to incorporate these learnings into its own transformational process.

Dharavi accommodates over 850,000 residents, and when considering the transient population, this figure surpasses 1 million. With a staggering population density of 354,167 per sq km, it is the most overcrowded zone in Mumbai, which itself ranks as the world's sixth most densely populated. Despite its challenging population density, Dharavi represents a unique tapestry of diversity, hosting a mosaic of over 85 communities.

This multi-religious and multi-ethnic settlement has been drawing in residents from various parts of India, including Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh. More than 6,000 small and medium enterprises operate in Dharavi and has an active informal economy in which numerous household enterprises employ many of the slum residents.

This means that February 2024 will consist of 29 days instead of the usual 28 days. Leap years occur every four years, with the previous one taking place in 2020 and the next one scheduled for 2028.

Here are some frequently asked questions about leap day and leap years:

Is 2024 a leap year?
Yes, 2024 is a leap year. It consists of 366 days instead of the usual 365 days.

What is leap day?
Leap day is an extra day added to the end of February every four years. This makes February have 29 days instead of the usual 28.

Why do we have leap years and leap days?
Leap years and leap days are necessary to keep our calendar in sync with the seasons. The Earth takes approximately 365.2422 days to complete one orbit around the Sun, which is slightly longer than 365 days. Without leap years, our calendar would gradually fall out of alignment with the seasons.

How do we determine which year is a leap year?
The rule is that a year is considered a leap year if it is divisible by four, except for years that are divisible by 100. However, if a year is divisible by 400, then it is still considered a leap year. For example, the year 2000 was a leap year, but the year 2100 will not be.

Why is leap day in February?
The choice of February as the month to add a leap day can be traced back to Julius Caesar's calendar reforms in ancient Rome. Inspired by the Egyptian solar calendar, Caesar introduced the Julian calendar, which included a leap year to align the calendar year with the solar year. Even after the Julian calendar evolved into the Gregorian calendar in 1582, the tradition of adding a leap day to February continued.

Are there any traditions or superstitions associated with leap day?
Yes, there are some traditions and superstitions related to leap day:

1. Sadie Hawkins Day: This tradition originated from a comic strip in 1937, where women are encouraged to propose to men or ask them out on a date on leap day, overturning traditional gender roles.

2. Bad luck for marriages: In certain cultures, leap day is considered a day of bad luck, particularly for weddings. In Scotland, it was believed that leap day was when witches gathered to cause mischief. In Greece, it was advised not to get married during a leap year, especially on leap day.

3. Special events and festivals: Some events and festivals are held specifically on leap day, such as the Honor Society of Leap Year Day Babies, which is a club for individuals born on February 29.

Leap years are a fascinating aspect of our timekeeping system, ensuring that our calendar remains in harmony with the Earth's journey around the sun.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/how-to/japan-tsunami-what-is-tsunami-their-causes-and-the-3-biggest-tsunamis-ever/articleshow/106449103.cms,"Japan Earthquake and Tsunami: Japan, a country situated in a seismically active region, has once again found itself grappling with the aftermath of a powerful earthquake. An earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale struck north central Japan on Monday. The US and Japanese agencies have raised alert for potentially dangerous tsunami waves, reaching heights of up to five meters. The agencies warned that the waves could occur along the northern coast of central Japan, within a 300-kilometer radius of the epicenter of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.

As the nation braces for potential coastal impacts, it is crucial to understand the nature of tsunamis, their causes, and historical instances of colossal waves that have left an indelible mark on coastal communities worldwide.

What is a Tsunami?
A tsunami is a series of ocean waves with extremely long wavelengths, often generated by undersea earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. Unlike regular ocean waves that are generated by the wind, tsunamis can travel across entire ocean basins with devastating force. These waves can move at incredible speeds and, upon reaching shallower coastal waters, transform into massive walls of water capable of causing widespread destruction.

What Causes Tsunamis?
Tsunamis are primarily caused by the sudden displacement of water, often resulting from underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides beneath the ocean floor. The most common trigger is an undersea earthquake, where tectonic plates shift and create a disturbance in the water above. As the displaced water travels outward from the epicenter, it forms the initial waves of a tsunami. Submarine volcanic eruptions and underwater landslides can also displace large volumes of water, triggering tsunami events.

The Three Biggest Tsunamis Ever Recorded
a. Indian Ocean Tsunami (2004): One of the deadliest tsunamis in recorded history, triggered by a massive undersea earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. The waves reached heights of up to 100 feet and affected countries around the Indian Ocean, claiming hundreds of thousands of lives.

b. Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami (2011): Striking off the coast of Japan, this 9.0-magnitude earthquake generated a powerful tsunami that inundated coastal areas and led to the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Waves reached heights of over 130 feet, making it one of the most significant tsunamis in recent history.

c. Lituya Bay, Alaska (1958): Although not ocean-wide, the landslide-induced tsunami in Lituya Bay stands as one of the tallest tsunamis ever recorded. Triggered by a massive rockfall, waves reached an astounding height of 1,720 feet, causing widespread destruction in the bay.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/book-some-profit-in-gail-bhel-a-buy-on-granules-india-aditya-arora/articleshow/106446927.cms,"Aditya Arora, Adlytick, says “the outperformance in the PSU counter may continue, but it has been a little overstretched. So, probably there could be a sentiment spillover in January but post that, there could be profit booking in all the PSE counters. So, mean reversion trade could be a good trade in the selective PSE basket, somewhere valuations are pretty stretched. I am not very bullish on this space.”

My first question today would not be on the index, but on a stock that has gained nearly 30% in two trading sessions, Vodafone-Idea. Any kind of technical trigger that you are seeing on this counter?
Aditya Arora: So, before talking about Vodafone-Idea, I would like to give a disclaimer that we had recommended a buy call on Vodafone on Friday itself in derivatives, which shot up 100%. Coming back to the question, I think the stock is in bull's control. They are strongly controlling and dominating the trend. There is a long way to go on the upside. This could be start of an uptrend which could take the stock upwards towards Rs 20-22 levels in long term and stop loss for the same should be maintained at Rs 14 but the outlook for the stock looks very strong whether you look at the news front, fundamental front or technical front or derivative front, stock looks very fantastic and very bullish.

PSU stocks continue to remain in favour, even in the first trading session of 2024. Do you expect the outperformance that we had seen in 2023 to continue even for a short term when it comes to PSU stocks?
Aditya Arora: The outperformance may continue, but it has been a little overstretched. So, probably there could be a sentiment spillover in January but post that, there could be profit booking in all the PSE counters. So, mean reversion trade could be a good trade in the selective PSE basket, somewhere valuations are pretty stretched. I am not very bullish on this space.

But have you looked at the charts of JBM Auto today? It is buzzing away in trade today. Specifically, we have seen a very sharp uptick, any interesting pattern that is forming up or anything interesting you are finding here?
Aditya Arora: Yes, absolutely. If you look at the Nifty Auto index, then it is just buzzing away and it is in top gear, whether you look at largecaps like Bajaj Auto or Maruti or Eicher Motor all are trading at 52-week high and they are backed by a good sales number as well. Similarly, JBM Auto also has bullish chart patterns. Hence, it is trading at a 52-week high. If one has to maintain a little positional view, then probably there is more upside over here.

Have you looked at the GAIL counter? It is up around 23% in December. Do you see more upside on this counter going forward?
Aditya Arora: Jjust like other PSE basket, the rally is pretty overstretched and in the first quarter of 2024, we can see some profit booking before the budget.

News flow has come in from BHEL in terms of an order win. That is the reason we are seeing a buzz in the stock, Anything interesting in terms of this one's chart?
Aditya Arora: Again, a disclaimer that we had a stock recommendation in this counter. But coming back to the question, this stock is behaving like any other PSE stock and at this point, if one is invested, then a good decision could be to take chips off the table because it is not at all bad to take some profit and go home and enjoy that profit. So, a little bit of profit booking can happen over here as well.

What are your top picks for the day?
Aditya Arora: The high beta counters have been little overstretched and valuation is hitting the roof, Nifty Pharma index is looking pretty good and components of the same are looking pretty good. In 2024, pharma index can dominate the trend. So, my stock pick would be Granules India, which could be bought at Rs 414; Rs 390 should be the stop loss and Rs 460 should be the target.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/new-updates/another-bizarre-theft-in-bihar-entire-pond-stolen-at-night/articleshow/106443562.cms,"Bihar has witnessed another perplexing theft, this time involving the disappearance of an entire pond in Darbhanga district. The pond, allegedly publicly-owned and utilized for activities such as fishing, vanished and was replaced by a hut, leaving locals bewildered, reported news channels. The sudden appearance of the hut, on the erstwhile pond, prompted residents to alert the police. The accused land mafia, responsible for filling the pond to acquire the land, had already fled when law enforcement arrived, reports said.

Locals said that the pond, once a community asset, became a target due to the escalating land prices in Darbhanga. Despite community complaints and interventions by zonal officials that temporarily halted the pond-filling, the land mafia clandestinely continued the levelling work under the cover of darkness, ultimately erasing the pond entirely, reports said.

Authorities had previously visited the site and seized some items, but the perpetrators managed to carry out their operation at night, police officials cited in the report said.

Bihar has gained notoriety for peculiar thefts perpetrated by humans, including the theft of an entire diesel engine part by part from a railway yard in Begusarai district. Thieves dug a tunnel to the yard, gradually dismantling and stealing parts of the engine that had been brought there for repairs.

The case came to light after a case was registered at the Barauni police station for ""Theft of a diesel engine, brought to the Garhara yard for repairs. Police recovered some missing parts from a gang which is also implicated in unbolting steel bridges and pilfering their components as well. In a separate incident last year, a railway engineer from Samastipur Loco Diesel Shed faced suspension for allegedly selling an old steam engine located at the Purnea court premises. The engineer purportedly used a forged letter from the divisional mechanical engineer of Samastipur, collaborating with other railway officials and security personnel in the engine's sale.""

In another incident last yearr, an entire 60-foot bridge vanished in Rohtas district. The thieves utilized JCBs and gas cutters to dismantle the bridge, causing it to disappear within just three days.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/fo-stocks-adani-enterprises-vodafone-idea-among-5-stocks-with-long-buildup/articleshow/106444231.cms,"Open interest indicates that bulls are likely to dominate the following counters.

In Monday’s trading session, the following five stocks witnessed a build of fresh long positions. Lets first understand how this conclusion is reached that whether the stock has seen a buildup of fresh long position or not. When the stock prices move up and open interest on the counter also moves upward, it is taken as a sign of a long buildup. The signal is considered more reliable if the volume on the counter has also seen an increase.

Vodafone Idea topped the list, the stock price gained 7.1%, and open interest saw a rise of 1.71%. Samvardhana Motherson International's stock price surged 5.15%, and open interest saw an increase of 1.07%.

LIC Housing Finance stock rose 3.56%, and the open interest saw an increase of 1.46%. National Aluminium price jumped 3.45% and open interest saw an increase of 2.48%. Adani Enterprises stock price gained 3.16% and open interest saw an increase of 3.67%.

Some additional checks would help traders in taking better trading decisions as they increase the probability of a follow-up of the upward movement in the stock price. First, if this fresh long build has come when the stock is very close to its 52-week high, that increases the probability of the stock making an attempt to break its previous 52-week high.

Second, if this long buildup is accompanied by any bullish crossover, which means that whether in the current up move when the open interest has moved up the stock price has been able to cross either its 20, 50 or 100-day moving average. Another couple of points which traders should keep in mind when taking a trade by looking at the matrix of buildup of long positions on the basis of open interest. Also check whether there is any extraordinary buildup of long positions in any out-of-money call option, especially any far-of-the-money call option. That indicates the probability of any informed person taking exposure through options.

We are very closely watching whatever is the situation and we will be ensuring that the bank should be very well capitalised. It is already well capitalised, but it should stay well capitalised and meet all the regulatory requirements because RBI prescription is one, our board prescription is invariably over and above that.”


Should we start with new year resolutions?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: Yes, new year resolution is to continue to improve upon where we left the year 2023.

That is SBI new year resolution, what about your new year resolution?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: Even my resolution is also in sync with what the SBI resolution is.

And you think that will happen in 2024 because incrementally with each passing quarter SBI has managed to move from strength to strength?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: Yes, I do agree and this will be our endeavour going forward too.

When you look at the demand versus credit growth, last time when we spoke to you, you were confident but conservative. What is your assessment of demand plus credit growth for FY24 for the remaining part?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: I expect that the GDP numbers which we have seen in the first half of the current financial year and if we add inflation component on that, will be about 12-13%. Normally we have been seeing that we are growing about 1% to 2% more than what the growth rate in the GDP is nominal growth rate. I expect that around 14-15% growth is something which we expect within the bank. We are on track for that and hopefully we will get to see these growth numbers at the end of the financial year too.

You have managed to turn a difficult number which is ROA, sub-1% has now become a permanent 1% plus. 1.2-1.3% is what markets are expecting would be the new normal for SBI. Will markets get it right?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: Hopefully, yes. For more than three quarters plus actually. Our last quarter we had seen 1.10%. So, I hope that we should be moving towards the trajectory of 1.20 as far as the ROA of the bank is concerned. There is a conscious effort and all endeavours are in that direction and hopefully we will get to see those numbers also.

What messaging do you think we are getting from the regulator because the regulator now clearly seems to be sending a message that okay, you got to watch out when it comes to the unsecured loan. They are really looking at tightening that space. Do you think we need to be worried about unsecured loans as a category now?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: The regulator was very clear that they have increased the RWAs for the unsecured loan. But while doing so they were looking at the general trajectory in the unsecured loan space in the banking sector and also the NBFC sector. So, though at a macro level perhaps the growth, it was too high for the unsecured loan piece, but when it comes to particularly State Bank of India, we had already calibrated our growth in the unsecured piece and on the top of it the quality of the unsecured in our case is much better.

I would say that it is more like a gold standard, touch wood, and we hope to maintain this quality and we do not envisage any challenge as far as our unsecured book is concerned. But yes, of course, with the increased RWAs for unsecured loan as well as for lending to NBFCs, some of the NBFCs there would be a situation where the cost of funds for such NBFCs will go up. Nevertheless, when it comes to housing finance companies, gold loans, etc, those are the companies where it does not really go up. They would be in a better position to avail the credit at the cheaper rates and they will continue to fuel the growth of the real asset in the economy.

Another important move from the regulator is to increase the D-SIB capital requirement for SBI and HDFC Bank. In the light of the fact that they are important banks, how should one read into it?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: I think it is a step which has been taken overall by the regulator considering the kind of risk which they are perceiving in the economy and also they would like to have the buffers created. With that in mind, it has been stipulated but it is effective from 1st of April 2025, that is what the prescription is.

I am quite confident that with the kind of plough back which we have, we will be in a position to generate adequate plough back to take care of this increased capital requirements which have been prescribed by RBI. We are very closely watching whatever is the situation and we will be ensuring that the bank should be very well capitalised. It is already well capitalised, but it should stay well capitalised and meet all the regulatory requirements because RBI prescription is one, our board prescription is invariably over and above that.

We have been always adhering to the board prescription and will stay well capitalised to take care of the regulatory concerns relating to some kind of risk which they are perceiving building up in the economy and more so that I would say it is more coming from the global economy point of view.

Just to go back to that whole point on unsecured loan, you mentioned that there are no red flags for SBI when it comes to the quality of the loan. But would you be consciously looking at slowing down the unsecured loan?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: Earlier we were also growing fast but now we are in the unsecured piece, we are growing at about 18% or so. So, it is still doing well as compared to many other subsegments of our book. We will be in a position to meet the natural demand for the unsecured loan which is there in our book, which I expect to be somewhere around 18% to 20%.

When we spoke to you last time, you were of the view that new areas like EV, energy transition, renewables, were the high growth areas for SBI. What is the update on that?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: No, that continues to be the major focus area. The renewable continues to be the major focus area and we continue to see the proposal coming in into this particular subsegment and similarly when it comes to EV battery storage, data centres, and these are the areas where we are seeing good interest from various entrepreneurs and we expect that we will get to see a decent demand in this particular segment too. Even for that matter, logistics, warehousing, etc, there also there is a demand which is seen and I would say that apart from the core infrastructure where the initiative which was taken by the Government of India is already yielding results.

In addition to that, these are the other areas where we are seeing the demand and I would say that some bit of a global supply chain balancing in terms of electronics and engineering goods also we are seeing those capacities also getting added in the economy, so that is the broad picture which I would say as far as the corporate loan book is concerned.

Just to get the cycle right, what you have guided for is the FY24 credit growth guidance. That is three months away and now markets will start talking about FY25 and FY26. Do you see the current credit cycle sustaining for at least three to five years with very low NPAs?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: This will be the function of how the real economy performs and the kind of growth trajectory which is being talked about for the real economy that is quite encouraging and in the backdrop of the real economic growth I perceive that it would be a decent opportunity for the banking system also to grow.

Do you think beyond FY24, the base effect would kick in and you would be slowing down. Don’t you see that happening?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: If GDP grows at about 8% or so, then I would say that this would be the kind of growth which we would like to see, the kind of numbers which we will be clocking this year, we expect the repeat of the same, but once we approach nearer to the actual time period, then perhaps we will be having a better visibility.

If I look at your numbers, assuming that you will grow at nominal GDP plus 1 to 2%, for FY25, your capital requirement would be zero. You will not come to the market for the next 18 months at least?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: That is the ideal situation. But we will be evaluating the scenario and based upon that, we will be taking appropriate calls.

If you plough back your last year's profit and projected profit, and if I add back your credit growth, I think you do not need money for next 18 months at least.
Dinesh Kumar Khara: That is the model which you want to practice because ideally speaking for a bank of this size and also considering the profits which you are generating, that is the best source for us to capitalise the growth.

It is so heartening to see how PSU banks have made a comeback. This is not once upon a time; five, six years ago, PSU banks were recapitalised at prices, not SBI, but other PSU banks at levels which were sub-book. Today banks and PSU banks and some of your peers are going and raising money via the QIP route. Have things really changed for the PSU sector, especially the PSU banking sector?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: A couple of things the PSU banks said. They always had a balance sheet which was heavy in terms of the corporate loan book. As far as the corporate loan book is concerned, the ecosystem changes which took place in terms of IBC and also in terms of the responsible borrowing, which we witnessed and also ability to resolve some of the impaired assets. That is something which I believe has changed the perception about the PSU bank and also has put in place the various models, which are quite robust.

I would say that they have strengthened their risk quite a lot, risk management practices, underwriting standards. So if at all, a bank has got a loan book, which is performing well, I think when it comes to the revenue stream, this is the most stable revenue stream, which the banks have. If at all they are not required to provide for, perhaps this is the best of the situation.

I would say that what we have seen today is essentially a culmination of various efforts which were taken by the government, by the regulator and by the banks also in terms of strengthening of their risk management practices. The net result of this combined effort is seen in the performance of the public sector banks today.

Just when it appeared that interest rates globally and locally have topped out and things were looking up in the war for liability is over, SBI has increased deposit rates in some categories. Is it specifically to some category or the war on liability is not over?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: No, no, no. Actually we were looking at the interest rate curves. So when we looked at it, we thought that there is a need to smoothen the rate curve to spread the maturity profile of the deposit from the ALM perspective. These are some of the areas where we felt that there is a need and we did that.

The war of liability, which everyone spoke about, was the story for 2022 and 2023.Is that over for the sector?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: I would say that some of the banks have got very high credit deposit ratios. So for them, I am sure liability will continue to be a major focus. But yes, of course, you know, the market has also witnessed, as Naren was rightly mentioning, that it is a time when people should look at asset allocation.

Similarly, when it comes to liabilities in the banking system, there are alternate options which are available. Invariably, we have seen that when the markets do well, there is a natural attraction of investing into the markets either through mutual funds or directly.

But I would say that it is essentially asset allocation and that principle holds good. So that is one of the reasons why perhaps we have seen this kind of a situation as far as the fight for liability was concerned. And apart from that, we have invariably seen that during inflationary conditions, there is a tendency on the part of the depositors to look for asset classes which can fetch them better. So that is the other reason which we cannot ignore. One has to operate in the overall macro situation and in that the various practices will differ from scenario to scenario.

You have taken the internal productivity of SBI to a different level. ROA has gone up, credit growth has been fantastic and the lending mechanisms are really in place. But market share of SBI has always been between 20% and 25% and that has happened in ordinary years. These are great years for SBI. What is your plan in place to gain SBI's market share?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: We look at it from the perspective of risk which is in line with our risk appetite. So that is something which you always keep in mind. And with that, whatever opportunity is available, we will certainly like to tap that and grow. Similarly, when it comes to liability side, we take advantage of our reach. We have focused on the customer experience. And we believe that our ability to offer a much better customer experience also helps us in gaining the mindshare of the customers, which eventually helps us in having the market share too.

In this new credit cycle, do you see PSU banks doing much better than private banks largely because they are lending aggressively in infrastructure, they are lending to build new India, and private banks have been very conservative, they are still focusing on the retail account, they are still focusing on HNI, they are still focusing on fee based income?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: The economy offers opportunities in all the sub-segments. But as I mentioned, each of the banks will have to decide their own niche area or the risk appetite. And based upon that, they invariably build up their skill set also in line with the risk appetite. And once they have built up those kinds of skill sets, they can exploit the market opportunities. I think that is what the guiding principle would be. I would say that it would be more ownership agnostic with either private or public, the kind of risk skill set which banks have built and also the opportunities which will unfold, will decide each of the bank's future growth trajectory.

When you took charge as SBI chairman, you had one mission, which was to clean up the NPAs and take ROAs higher. What is the next mission statement for Dinesh Kumar Khara?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: I would say that we would like to maintain the gold standard of the asset quality in the bank, and we will continue to focus on improving the customer experience and also invest well in terms of technology. We would also be exploring the possibilities of adoption of generative AI so that we can further improve the productivity of our bank and create value for all the stakeholders.

Your closing comments last time were that SBI was not getting ready for salsa, it was getting ready for tango. And it is a New Year, dance parties are over now, but when will SBI do the tango?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: I think we will wait and watch.

How do you see 2024 being different from 2023 for SBI?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: In each subsequent year, we have only strengthened our position. So we have invested in terms of technology, and every subsequent year, we would like to reap the benefit of our investments into technology. That technology helps us improve our operations too. So this is a, this is more of a journey, year after year is a journey and it is a journey for improvement.

Sir, a question on what IBA has agreed, a 17% wage hike in the latest meeting, what kind of impact that will have because of, A) the legacy issue and B) the new wage hike?
Dinesh Kumar Khara: Wage hike etc. is a reality in which all of us have to operate and that is why it is always our effort and endeavour to keep on improving our earnings so that we can easily address these kinds of obligations which are a reality for us.

Before we wrap, one of the most underappreciated number of SBI has been the attrition rate. I look at the balance sheet of some of your private peers, I am not getting into names, the number is at 40 to 50%. For SBI, the number is very admirable. What is the number for SBI? I mean, we never talk about this number, we should talk about it more.
Dinesh Kumar Khara: It is actually the much lower single digit.

SBI attrition is single digit and private banks have been 50 to 60% if my numbers are right.
Dinesh Kumar Khara: Yes, we are just within about, in the very low single digit numbers. So that is the kind of attrition and normally, we get to see the attrition only in the early stages when people join the bank say in about, in the initial five to seven years’ time. Thereafter, those who stay on, actually start looking at the growth opportunities within the bank. Also, it is not merely vertical growth but it is also horizontal growth too because they get to have opportunities to work in all the sub-segments of the financial sector.

Even in banking, which is quite a complex area, they have got an opportunity to identify their area of interest and can develop into that. So, as a bank, we also invest quite a lot in terms of training our own employees. And we have six apex level training institutes where the role is both ideation and dissemination. Apart from the six apex level institutes, we have more than 50 learning centres across the country. We have invested well in terms of our training capabilities, and which really help us well in terms of equipping our manpower."

And no we are not talking about stock market predictions, or tentative guesses on the release date of your favourite Bollywood movies, but predictions regarding significant events such as war, royal rifts, etc.

Curious about how 2024 will unfold? Let Nostradamus, a 16th-century astrologer guide you.

A Huge Naval War
In his book ‘Les Prophecies’ (The Prophecies), Nostradamus predicted that the world will witness a terrible naval war in 2024. He predicted that “Red adversary will become pale with fear, putting the great Ocean in dread.” Some analysts have interpreted this as referring to an attack by China on Taiwan (as the flag of China is red in colour).

All Hail King Harry?
In his text, Nostradamus predicted that the “King of the Isles” would be “driven out by force.” Soon after, [a disastrous war] “a new King shall be anointed / Who, for a long time, will appease the earth.”

In an interview with the tabloid Daily Mail, author Mario Reading said that the ‘King Of Isles’ may be a reference to King Charles III, who may abdicate it in favour of Prince Harry, due to relentless personal attacks against him and Queen Camilla.

An Imminent Climatic Catastrophe?
The astrologer warned that climatic changes will continue to wreak havoc on us. One passage stated, “The dry earth will grow more parched, and there will be great floods when it is seen.” This may indicate rising global temperature and heat wave due to greenhouse effect.

A New Pope
The astrologer predicted that Pope Francis, the current religious head for the Catholics could have a replacement. “Through the death of a very old Pontiff, A Roman of good age will be elected, Of him it will be said that he weakens his see, But long will he sit and in biting activity,” wrote the astrologer.

Who Was Nostradamus?
Nostradamus was a French astrologer, apothecary, physician and seer. In his book ‘Les Propheties’ (published in 1555), he left several predictions about world events through 942 poetic quatrains."

The company has recently teased its upcoming release, a 440cc motorcycle, scheduled for launch on January 22. The teaser is not only marked by the manufacturer's departure from its traditional offerings but also features a distinct bassy exhaust note, adding to the intrigue.

The emphasis on the letter 'R' in the teaser further suggests a naming convention for the new bike. Hero MotoCorp appears to be taking bold steps in the premium segment, especially after its collaboration with the US-based Harley-Davidson for the X440 model. Now, the company is gearing up to introduce its own model in this segment, thus broadening its premium lineup.

This move is part of Hero's strategy to diversify its premium category lineup by introducing models with two distinct engines and architectures. There's even the possibility of an all-new engine making its debut.

Sources suggest that the upcoming motorcycle may share the platform with the Harley Davidson X440, although with a unique and distinctive design. Speculations are rife that the motorcycle might adopt the same 440cc single-cylinder, oil and air-cooled engine found in its Harley Davidson stablemate. This engine is known to deliver a robust performance of 27 bhp and 38 Nm of peak torque, coupled with a six-speed gearbox featuring an assist and slipper clutch. However, adjustments to the engine's state of tune might be made to suit the characteristics of the upcoming model.

As we eagerly anticipate the launch on January 22, enthusiasts and potential buyers are advised to stay tuned to here for the latest updates on the automotive sector.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/et-explains/et-explainer-how-complaints-will-be-dealt-with-under-telecommunications-act/articleshow/106445717.cms,"The Telecommunications Act 2023 has beefed up the dispute resolution framework by ringing in an online grievance redressal system. The objective is to speed up resolution of disputes between telcos and consumers and make the redressal process transparent. Post-inquiry, a telco in breach of licence/service terms, can face stiff penalties, cancellation of spectrum holdings, service restrictions or even be barred from offering telecom services, depending on the gravity of the contravention. Here’s an ET Explainer by Kalyan Parbat on the key players and how the grievance redressal system will work.


The Centre will appoint an Adjudicating Officer (AO) not below joint secretary rank to conduct an inquiry to resolve disputes between telecom service providers and consumers. It will also establish a separate Designated Appeals Committee (DAC), comprising officers at the rank of additional secretaries. People aggrieved by an AO’s order can move the DAC. Anyone aggrieved by the DAC order, in turn, can move the telecom tribunal, . The AO and DAC will function as digital offices, in that their operations will be fully online. Any telco involved in a dispute will have to participate in the grievance redressal process.


If the licence/service terms under the Telecommunications Act are found to have been breached by a telco, an AO initially issues a notice to start an inquiry. The AO can, subsequently, pass a written order, mandating course correction. The official can also impose specified civil penalties, depending on the gravity of the breach. Further, the AO can call on the Centre to restrict or stop the telco’s services and even cancel spectrum allotment.


For breach of conditions under Sections 32 and 34 of the Telecom Act, penalties can range from Rs 1 lakh for minor offences to Rs 1-5 crore for major and severe violations. The AO will fix the penalty size after assessing the gravity of the contravention, the number of people harmed by it, whether it triggered a disproportionate gain, or if it was repetitive, negligent, intentional, or caused revenue losses to the government. Before fixing the penalty, the AO will also check if the errant telco had taken any steps to mitigate the contravention.


The AO and the DAC will have the powers of a civil court. Adjudication activities before them will be deemed as judicial proceedings.


A telco can make an advance voluntary disclosure to the AO about a contravention of licence/service terms, before an inquiry is initiated. The telco can also submit a voluntary undertaking on steps already taken, or measures it proposes to take within a specified time to mitigate such contravention. If the AO accepts such a voluntary undertaking, he must treat it as a mitigation measure, and factor it in before determining the penalty."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/india-starts-four-year-term-as-un-statistical-commission-member/articleshow/106445998.cms,"India started its four-year term as a member of the United Nations Statistical Commission on Monday. The country had won the election to the global statistics body in April after a gap of nearly two decades.

The period of India’s term corresponds with the time that the 24-member body will decide on new norms for national accounts, which will also play an important role in changing India’s GDP calculations. The last revision to national accounts was made in 2008, which forms the basis of India’s current GDP series, with 2012 as a base year.

The system of national accounts is an internationally agreed standard recommendation on measures to compile economic activity.

India’s membership in the statistical body will likely have a bearing on the determination of new systems of environmental accounts and the determination of aspects of well-being and sustainability for economies.

The country has been trying to create a regular database of parameters under the Sustainable Development Goals.

In the 2023 session, the statistical body organised a high-level forum on official statistics to look beyond measures like the GDP, which measures economic performance and focus on measures of well-being aligning with SDGs, which are to be met by 2030.

The forum also introduced measures like the multidimensional vulnerability index (MVI) to “assess the vulnerability of small island states as well as other countries.”

The nodal body of statistics in the country, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has been trying to develop a database of high-frequency socio-economic indicators which cannot be compiled using administrative data.

The 79th round of the National Sample Survey had a Comprehensive Annual Modular Survey component, along with a detailed questionnaire on Ayurveda, Yoga and naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy.

ET had earlier reported that the government is starting the 80th round of surveys, which may include a survey on the impact of digital payments, along with CAMS.

The CAMS captures details like people owning mobile phones, population with drinking water services, households with a computer or internet, and access to financial institutions.

The ministry also aims to complete the household consumption expenditure survey this year, which shall help revise the consumer price index series.

Short-term traders can look to buy the stock for a possible target above 4000-4300 levels in the 2 months, suggest experts.

Divi’s Laboratories Ltd stock rose more than 5% in a week and over 4% in a month. The momentum helped the stock to break out from an inverse Head & Shoulder pattern and at the same time, it is making a rounding bottom formation on weekly charts.

The neckline of the inverse Head and Shoulder pattern was placed above 3800 levels. The stock closed at 3901 for the week ended 29th December 2023.

“Divi’s Laboratories stock has given a breakout of inverse head and shoulders pattern on daily charts which formed over almost 4 months. The breakout of the pattern was observed with rising volumes which favours bulls,” Aditya Thukral, Founder and analyst for AT Research & Risk Managers, said.

“At the same time, the stock is exhibiting a rounding bottom formation on weekly charts which is a bullish signal. The ticker is in an uptrend with the formations of higher highs and higher lows on the short-term as well as long-term charts,” he said.


In terms of price action, the stock is trading well above most of the crucial short- and long-term moving averages such as 5,10,30,50,100 and 200-DMA on the daily charts which is a positive sign for the bulls.

The positioning of RSI on weekly charts is still around 60 and provides room for longs to enjoy further upside in the stock.

The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 66.8. RSI below 30 is oversold and above 70 is considered overbought, Trendlyne data showed. The daily MACD is above its center and signal Line, this is a bullish indicator.

“Data points suggest that an uptrend continuation is expected in the stock prices where longs should have stop losses below 3565 on a weekly closing basis which is the higher low of the current rally,” highlights Thukral.

“The stock is comfortably placed above all the major exponential moving averages viz. 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day. The inverse head and shoulders pattern formed on charts suggests a target of 4380 levels on the stock which can take up to two months to achieve,” he recommended."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/air-india-express-taps-nclt-doors-for-final-nod-to-its-merger-plans-with-aix/articleshow/106435870.cms,"In a strategic move for the coming year, Tata Group is progressing towards the consolidation of its four airlines.

According to a TOI report, Air India Express has initiated the 'second motion' for a final hearing in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to merge AIX Connect (formerly known as AirAsia India) into its operations. Anticipating approval by March, this merger will result in the operation of both airlines under a single air operator certificate or license.

The larger-scale merger involving Vistara into Air India is contingent on the latter reaching a specified operational level, as communicated by Air India's Managing Director and CEO, Campbell Wilson, in September to TOI. While the exact timeline for this merger remains undisclosed, insiders suggest it is also slated for realization in 2024.

Flight Map
Air India Express is poised to concentrate on less-saturated markets and tier II & III cities, while Air India, in addition to medium to ultra-long-haul routes, will prioritize routes with a substantial premium traffic share. The former will play a pivotal role in providing crucial connectivity to Air India's hubs in Delhi and Mumbai, catering to the escalating number of wide-body flights spanning the globe.

Aloke Singh, CEO of Air India Express, outlined the expansion plans, saying, ""With a current fleet of 62 aircraft (combining both low-cost carriers), we plan to induct 50 new Boeing 737 Max within the next 12 months. After retiring some older planes, Air India Express is expected to operate a fleet of about 98 aircraft by December."" Tata Group's colossal order for 470 aircraft last February, which includes 190 B737 Max for its low-cost carrier, underlines its commitment to fortifying its presence in the aviation sector.

Singh emphasized the consolidation strategy, explaining, ""While we will introduce new domestic and international routes, our initial focus is on strengthening our existing network. For example, when we initiated flights to Surat, we began from Delhi. Subsequently, we swiftly introduced direct flights connecting Surat to Bengaluru, Kolkata, Sharjah, and Dubai. This approach mirrors our expansion plans for Ayodhya, where we commenced flights from Delhi, followed by direct routes to Bengaluru and Kolkata.""

The Bigger Picture
In November 2022, Tata Sons kick started the process of consolidating its airline entities Vistara, AirAsia India and Air India Express under Air India, following a series of discussions with Singapore Airlines (SIA), its joint venture partner in Vistara, a move that will make Air India the second largest airline in the country in terms of fleet and market share.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in September last year approved the merger of Tata SIA Airlines into Air India, subject to certain conditions. The long pending merger of fully owned Tata airline Air India and sister airline Vistara, came through weeks after the watchdog raised concerns about market power.

""In India’s current political landscape, the consensus among political analysts is that a win for Modi and the BJP is the most plausible outcome,"" writes Hannah Ellis-Petersen, citing BJP's recent wins in three state elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.

""In the current political landscape, analysts widely agree that a Modi and BJP triumph is the most plausible outcome. Modi's popularity as a political strongman, coupled with the BJP's Hindu nationalist agenda, resonates strongly with the large Hindu majority, particularly in the populous Hindi belt of the north,"" the author writes.

The author said that there exists some regional opposition to the BJP in pockets of south and east India, at the national level opposition appears fragmented and weak. About the recently formed opposition INDIA alliance, the author writes that it is yet ""to unite on crucial issues, though it vows to collectively challenge the BJP.""

“The general sense is that a BJP win is almost an inevitability at this stage,” according to Neelanjan Sircar, a fellow at the Centre for Policy research, as cited by the author. “The question is more: what factors will shape the scale of the victory?”

On Congress, the author said that though the party won the election in Telangana it holds power in just three states and is ""perceived as hierarchical and riddled with infighting.""

The author says that whether the BJP can replicate the sweeping parliamentary majority of 2019 in 2024 Lok Sabha elections remains uncertain. ""While Modi secured power in 2014 due to an anti-incumbency wave, his 2019 re-election victory was influenced by India's airstrikes on Pakistan, following a terrorist incident before the polls, sparking national security sentiment in his favor,"" she writes.

The BJP's recent dominance in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh reaffirms Modi's popularity., the author says. PM's Modi’s role in elevating India as a global power in international politics and the moon landing in August –was also prominent messaging in the state polls.

In the recent state elections, the BJP strategically put Modi front and centre of their campaigns in the place of local leaders. The author says that the opening of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya will be one of the main election agendas of BJP.

The BJP’s welfare schemes – which provide large amounts of free food and cash handouts – will also be a part of BJP's election messaging, the author said.









India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has cut a confident figure in recent weeks. As his Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) swept three major state elections in December, Modi did not hold back from predicting that “this hat-trick has guaranteed the 2024 victory”.

It was a sign that with less than six months to go before the general election, in which Modi will be seeking a third term in power, campaign season has begun with gusto.

In India’s current political landscape, the consensus among political analysts is that a win for Modi and the BJP is the most plausible outcome.

The prime minister’s popularity as a political strongman, alongside the BJP’s Hindu nationalist agenda, continues to appeal to the large Hindu majority of the country, particularly in the populous Hindi belt of the north.

At state and national level, the apparatus of the country has been skewed heavily towards the BJP since Modi was elected in 2014.

While regional opposition to the BJP is strong in pockets of south and east India, nationally it is seen as fragmented and weak. The main opposition Indian National Congress party won the state election in Telangana this month but is in power in only three states overall and is perceived as hierarchical and riddled with infighting.

The recently formed coalition of all major opposition parties – which goes by the acronym INDIA – has yet to unite on crucial issues, though it has vowed to fight the BJP collectively.

“The general sense is that a BJP win is almost an inevitability at this stage,” said Neelanjan Sircar, a fellow at the Centre for Policy research. “The question is more: what factors will shape the scale of the victory?”

The BJP’s recent domination in the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh appeared to reaffirm the popularity of Modi. Though the prime minister has little to do with state elections, which are designed to elect local assembly members, the BJP strategically put Modi front and centre of their campaigns in the place of local leaders, where he appeared at dozens of rallies to directly appeal to voters and present himself as the embodiment of the party.

Modi’s messaging in these campaign speeches combined an emphasis on the BJP’s paternalistic welfare schemes – which provide large amounts of free food and cash handouts – with nationalistic and religiously communal rhetoric, offering a glimpse of how the BJP intends to fight the election on a national scale.

Modi’s role in elevating India as a global power – be that in international politics or in the recent its moon landing in August – it was the first country to successfully land a spacecraft near the lunar south pole – was also prominent.

Modi was brought to power in 2014 largely on the back of an anti-incumbency wave while his re-election victory in 2019 was all but secured after India carried out airstrikes on Pakistan, after a terrorist incident a few months before the polls, resulting in a storm of national security sentiment in his favour.

However, whether the BJP will win the same sort of sweeping parliamentary majority it secured in 2019 is unclear.

Indeed, one of the biggest issues likely to dominate the BJP’s agenda pre-election is the long-awaited opening of the Ram Mandir, a grand Hindu temple that has been built in the place of a demolished mosque. Construction of the building, in the north Indian town of Ayodhya, has long been a focal point of the Hindu nationalist movement in India, and the fanfare around Modi’s inauguration of the temple later this month in January is expected to be a national event.

Baijayant Panda, national vice president of the BJP, said the party was very confident about the parliamentary elections. He credited the confidence in part to “the Modi premium”, which meant the BJP tended to perform better in national than state elections because of the “stratospheric popularity” of the prime minister.

“On the ground, there’s a huge surge of optimism, even in areas which we haven’t traditionally won,” said Panda. “Having had this kind of victory in the state elections completely cements our position.”
















The hat-trick of victories in three state assemblies, combined with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's immense popularity and emotive issues such as the Ram Temple inauguration in Ayodhya, has made a third, straight term for the BJP at the Centre 'almost an inevitability', read a column in the UK-based daily, The Guardian.
The column, by Hannah Ellis-Peterson, pointed to the saffron sweep in the three heartland states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan have added more strength and momentum to the BJP going into the crucial Lok Sabha elections next year.

After assembly wins in three states, PM Modi himself didn't hold back from predicting that ""this hat-trick has guaranteed the 2024 victory"", the column noted.

In India's current political landscape, the consensus among political analysts is that a win for Modi and the BJP is the ""most plausible outcome"", Ellis-Peterson added in her piece.

""The prime minister's popularity as a political strongman, alongside the BJP's Hindu nationalist agenda, continues to appeal to the large Hindu majority of the country, particularly in the populous Hindi belt of the north"", the column read, adding, ""At the state and national level, the apparatus of the country has been skewed heavily towards the BJP since Modi was elected (PM) in 2014"".

The column noted further that while the regional opposition to the BJP was strong in pockets of south and east India, nationally it is seen as 'fragmented and weak'.

""The main opposition -- Indian National Congress -- won the state election in Telangana this month but is in power in only three states overall and is perceived as ""hierarchical and riddled with infighting"", The Guardian reported.

""The recently formed coalition of all major opposition parties -- which goes by the acronym INDIA -- is yet to unite on crucial issues, though it has vowed to fight the BJP collectively,"" the piece read further, adding, ""The general sense is that a BJP win is almost an inevitability at this stage,"" said Neelanjan Sircar, a fellow at the Centre for Policy Research. ""The question is more: what factors will shape the scale of the victory?""

Pointing to the BJP's 'nationwide pre-election push' -- 'Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra', the column stated that it features the deployment of 'thousands of government officers' to towns and villages across the country over the next two months, ""tasked with speaking about the BJP's successes over the past nine years"".

The Ministry of Defence is also setting up 822 'selfie points' at war memorials, defence museums, railway stations and tourist attractions where people can take photos of themselves with a cutout of PM Modi, The Guardian reported.

""PM Modi rose to power in 2014 largely on the back of an anti-incumbency wave while his re-election victory in 2019 was all but secured after India carried out airstrikes on Pakistan, after a terrorist incident a few months before the polls, resulting in a storm of national security sentiment in his favour,"" wrote Ellis-Petersen.

However, she added in her piece that it was 'unclear' if the BJP would be able to repeat its landslide mandate like 2019.

The party's position remains uncertain in the crucial states of Bihar and Maharashtra, the column noted, adding that issues such as 'jobs and inflation' could affect voting the pattern.

""BJP's dominant victories in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh have reaffirmed PM Modi's popularity. Though (the) PM has little to do with state elections, which are designed to elect local assembly members, the BJP strategically put Modi front and centre of their campaigns in the place of local leaders, where he appeared at dozens of rallies to directly appeal to voters and present himself as the embodiment of the party,"" The Guardian column read further.

It added that ""PM Modi's messaging in these campaign speeches combined an emphasis on the BJP's paternalistic welfare schemes along with (an) nationalistic agenda"".

The column commended PM Modi's ""role in elevating India as a global power - be that in international politics or in the recent its moon landing in August"".

On the grand opening of the Ram Temple by PM Modi on January 22, the column noted that it was ""one of the biggest issues likely to dominate the BJP's agenda"" before the general elections.

The 'fanfare' around the inauguration of the temple later is expected to be a national event, the piece read.

The column quoted Baijayant Panda, the national vice president of the BJP, as saying that the party was very confident about its prospects for the Lok Sabha polls.

He credited the confidence in part to 'the Modi premium', elaborating that the BJP tended to perform better in national than state elections because of the ""stratospheric popularity"" of Prime Minister Modi, according to The Guardian.

""On the ground, there's a huge surge of optimism, even in areas which we haven't traditionally won"", Panda was quoted as saying in the report.

""Having had this kind of victory in the state elections completely cements our position,"" he added.

Amid concerns by some detractors around a third term for PM Modi and what it portends for the country, Panda affirmed that it would be defined by economic success and India becoming the world's third-largest major economy.

Pushing back against allegations of communalism against the BJP, Panda added, ""I dare anyone to point out where a minority, whether a Muslim or a Christian or Buddhist or a Sikh has been discriminated against in the governance of India, you will not find a single example."" (ANI)

Many themes which did well in 2023 could continue to do well in 2024 but not at the same pace.


What do you think is going to be the big trend to watch out for in terms of, let us say a sector or a theme, anything specifically that you are watching out for?
Sandip Sabharwal: First of all, best wishes to all your viewers and all of you also in the studio. I hope everyone has a great 2024. 2023 was very good for investors; it was unprecedented. If anyone says that they expected that mid-cap index will rally more than 45% and small caps by more than 55%, they will just be lying. No one expected what happened.

So I think market surprises and what will happen in 2024 is tough to say but what is very clear is that the economy is on the ascendance. The economic growth trends for the longer term seem more clear now than they were a few years back. And that by itself is long-term good for equity investors. We now stand at a place where at around 120, 125% of GDP in terms of market capitalization, the markets seem to be stretched. So some give away if it happens, then the market becomes healthier.

In terms of trends, clearly we have seen that the investment cycle and its pickup and a trend towards green energy and what many companies are doing in terms of trying to, like the overall theme has to be on the investment side, also companies are diversifying towards more renewable things, etc. That is something where we should see continuous investments and some ideas could come up on that segment except that the economy year on year does not change so much. Many themes which did well in 2023 could continue to do well in 2024 but not at the same pace.

You would not change the basic construct of your portfolio because your portfolio is tilted towards names like Indian Hotels, L&T. I think it has a Mahindra & Mahindra. You have got some banks, You will not change that construct of the portfolio?
Sandip Sabharwal: Overall, not. Right now, we have around maybe 15% plus minus kind of cash across different categories of portfolios which we will be looking to redeploy. But then, ex of that there is nothing changing. The portfolio has to be more domestic focused and India will do much better than the global economy. So externally facing sectors might not do as well as the domestic focused sectors.

A lot of small themes are now sprouting up; religious tourism, luxury cars, airport infrastructure. Now, these are small themes, but they have potential to become multi-year themes. We know that 50-60 new airports will be built in the next couple of years and a parallel economy will get created. It may not be the best trade for 2024 but if you buy now, you could potentially hit a multibagger in 2024-25 or 26.
Sandip Sabharwal: At this stage, tough to comment because I have not really tracked any of these themes per se. What you are saying is right but I think that could benefit some of the incumbents only. So, not really very clear on what could benefit because of this.

Should one buy ESG dominated companies or traditional businesses? For example, in 2022, anything which has got to do with the ESG negative score, did not find fancy with the market. In 2023, the reverse happened. In 2022, the market mantra was, from wherever smoke comes out, do not buy. In 2023, it was from where smoke comes out, that is where gains were. What is your view on some of these so-called ESG related businesses for 2024?
Sandip Sabharwal: ESG is overhyped. I do not think it plays so well. It is good to create. We see whenever this phenomenon happens, many companies also change their names to show that they are more on the ESG side. Some finance companies will change their name to Green Finance and all of these things. But I think these are just antics. They do not change the business fundamentals. I do not think that ESG investing as a theme is as big as what people thought it will be two, three years back and it is more back to traditional investing only.

Do you think in January this time, we could be in for a lot of volatility? I mean a) history tells us that January is more down than up, b) markets, at least Nifty has run up 10% plus in a jiffy and the earning season is not likely to keep pace with what the reality of the market is.
Sandip Sabharwal: When markets run up so much, then earnings become very important like most of the cases earnings are not so important. But after such a sharp runup, the earnings have to justify what the market move has been and to that extent you are right that wherever there is even slight disappointment we could see significant sell-offs. I would tend to agree that this result season will be more volatile than the earlier ones. Now the key for investors is to try to look out for opportunities as the results come out and as some disappointments create sell-offs in some stock we might be interested in.

Overall my view is that in the first two months of this year, we should be a bit careful if there is a decent correction then that could give buying opportunities.

Where would you look at locking some gains? Would you be looking at locking some gains in PSUs – in defence and railways?
Sandip Sabharwal: Overall in the PSU basket, people should look at locking in some gains because many stocks have moved up without much change in fundamentals and even for companies which are winning orders etc. you need to see the profits also. Most PSU companies used to trade at single digit valuations two years back, today a majority of them are trading at between 30 to 50 PE ratio, so things have changed in defence and railways for sure.

But for the overall basket, not so much that the valuation change should be so drastic. I think there is too much retail investor participation in this segment now and there will be some disappointments in 2024 in this segment.

You were talking about selling and booking some gains in PSUs as well but would you still find some value in some of these other names or something like an REC which is a very good dividend bet as well?
Sandip Sabharwal: I think REC, PFC have got significantly re-rated based on assumptions of better asset quality and significantly high disbursement growth so at these valuation these stocks are trading at valuation of large cap private sector banks similar to them like maybe some discount here or there. I personally think they deserve this and people should be careful after such straight line moves."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/how-much-can-nifty-go-up-in-2024-after-record-shattering-2023-lets-do-some-crystal-gazing/articleshow/106438230.cms,"After clocking eight successive years of positive returns and ending 2023 with a solid 20% return, analysts predict that Nifty’s winning run may continue in the new year 2024 but with a more limited upside.

Stating that the returns in 2024 will depend on the tussle between fundamentals and sentiment, Kotak Institutional Equities said in an entirely ‘fundamental’ market, returns will likely be modest for the market and negative for many stocks.

""A bottom-up plug-in of our 12-month fair values for individual stocks shows a modest 1% upside for the Nifty-50 Index. In a less-than-fundamental market, market returns can vary, as it is impossible to factor in sentiment in any market calculus,"" Kotak's Sanjeev Prasad said.

Nifty's fair value at the end of the year is seen at 21,990 by the broking firm.

While reminding investors that increased focus on fundamentals versus flows may result in a correction, Prasad said, ""We have no idea though as to what will change the market’s bullish return expectations, which have been reinforced by the stellar returns of the past three years for ‘new’ retail investors.""

In the past, India has seen a significant correction in extreme valuations in 2001 and 2008 and due to domestic or global shocks in 2004, 2016-17 and 2020.

An ETMarkets poll of 23 analysts from Dalal Street shows that most analysts see Nifty ending at 23,000.

In the base scenario, Axis Securities sees Nifty at 23,000 in December 2024 by predicting that earnings will grow at 14% CAGR over FY23-26. ""For our base case, we assume the continuation of the political stability and consequent visibility on the policy continuity after the 2024 general elections,"" it said.

Domestic broking firm Motilal Oswal believes that despite fair valuations, macro factors and buoyant corporate earnings augur well with potential for further upside.

""As CY23 was marked by multi-year high-interest rates, concerns about banking crises in the US and Europe, and geopolitical uncertainties, CY24 is likely to bring some moderation in these issues, especially on the interest rate front. With global liquidity tightening nearing its end, a healthy domestic macro and micro environment, strong domestic and retail participation, and expected political continuity post-2024 General Elections, bode well for policy momentum in India,"" Motilal's Gautam Duggad said.

For Motilal, Nifty trades at a 12-month forward P/E of 19.6x, near its long-term average of 20.2x but at a 15% discount to Sept 2021 high.

""We anticipate continued optimism in the market and maintain a positive outlook and overweight stance on sectors such as BFSI, industrials, real estate, auto and consumer discretionary,"" it said.

Kotak analysts, however, say barring largecap banks where valuations are still somewhat reasonable, most other sectors and stocks are overvalued.

""Investors have had certain odd arguments for their distaste for banks (peaking margins, bottoming credit costs). These arguments sound odd in that they are very well-known and presumably factored into Street expectations. Anyway, the risk of de-rating is on the lower side for banks, while it seems very high for most other sectors,"" Kotak said."

Meanwhile, YES Bank's share price today came close to its 52-week high of Rs 23.05 apiece on BSE.

At 10.50 am, the scrip was trading 5% higher at Rs 22.5 on BSE. The stock has also surged nearly 40% in the last six months and 65% in the past two years. However, it has plunged 88% in the last five years.

The private lender witnessed a total of 27,64,61,942 equity shares worth Rs 619.27 crore changed hands so far in Monday's trade.

In Q2 FY24, the bank reported a 47.4% year-on-year (YoY) growth in net profit to Rs 225 crore. Total income from operations increased by 25% on year to Rs 7,921 crore.

However, net interest income (NII), the difference between interest earned and interest expended, declined 3.3% on year to Rs 1,925 crore. Provisions and contingencies for the quarter were Rs 500 crore, compared to Rs 583 crore a year ago.

Meanwhile, operating profit for the quarter rose a mere 1.4% on year to Rs 801 crore. The capital adequacy ratio as of September end was 17.1%, compared to 18.2% a quarter ago.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/saudi-fund-outpaces-singapores-gic-with-31-6-billion-splurge/articleshow/106439291.cms,"Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund emerged as the world’s most active sovereign investor last year, boosting its deal activity even as most global peers including GIC Pte and Temasek Holdings Pte slashed spending.

PIF, as the Saudi fund is known, deployed $31.6 billion in 2023, according to research consultancy Global SWF. That was higher than the $20.7 billion it invested the previous year, an increase that contrasts with a wider trend — globally state-owned investors deployed $124.7 billion, about a fifth less than the prior year.

The declines were led by GIC, which cut the amount of capital deployed by 46% to $19.9 billion and lost its spot as the world’s most active sovereign wealth fund for the first time in six years. Temasek also reduced new investments by 53% to $6.3 billion against a backdrop of volatile markets, which led the two Singapore-based investors to report worsening returns.

Global SWF said much of GIC’s decline related to investments across developed markets. Singapore’s state investors continued to be active in emerging markets like India, with deals including GIC’s $1.4 billion joint venture with Brookfield India REIT and Temasek’s increased stake in Manipal Health Enterprises.

“Singaporean investors are being more cautious and we’ve seen that reflected in the numbers,” Global SWF said. “Gulf sovereign wealth funds have increased their domination of the global transaction activity, to the detriment of Singaporean and Canadian funds, and now represent almost 40% of all investment value deployed by sovereign investors.”

Overall, sovereign wealth funds controlled by the hydrocarbon-rich governments of Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia and Qatar took five spots on a list of the top 10 most active funds last year.

That trend could be set to continue. The governments of the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain are set to control about $4.4 trillion in gross foreign assets by the end of 2024, two-thirds of which will likely be managed by sovereign wealth funds, according a report issued by the Institute of International Finance in December.

The region is home to a gamut of sovereign funds, which have become an increasingly prominent source of cash for international deals after a surge in energy prices in 2022 left most Gulf government budgets in surplus.

The PIF was behind the largest sovereign-backed deals of the year, either directly or through its subsidiaries. These include its nearly $5 billion acquisition of US gaming company Scopley through Savvy Games Group and a $3.6 billion acquisition of Standard Chartered’s aviation leasing business through Avilease.

The Saudi fund was also behind significant domestic deals to help support the diversification of the economy under a plan by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who is also PIF chairman.

In September, the fund acquired the steel business of Sabic Basic Industries Corp. in a $3.3 billion deal that helped push PIF’s domestic investment to around 42% of total deployment in 2023.

“The variety of deals shows the unparalleled bandwidth and reach of PIF and its subsidiaries,” Global SWF said in the report"

Shailesh Chandra, Managing Director of Tata Motors' Passenger Vehicles and Electric Mobility Divisions, affirmed the company's commitment to introducing new electric models without slowing down. Tata Motors, which currently offers electric versions of Nexon, Tigor, and Tiago, plans to launch three new electric models in 2024: the Punch mini SUV, Harrier premium off-roader, and Curvv coupe.

Chandra stated that Tata Motors expects sales to reach 65,000-70,000 units in the current year, marking a growth rate of 60% to 70%. The company also aims to introduce electric vehicles with a higher range of 600 km on a single charge.

Gaurav Gupta, Deputy Managing Director at MG Motor India, anticipates a 100% growth in EVs in the coming year. He attributes this growth to new car launches, the development of the charging infrastructure, and consumers recognizing the cost benefits of electric vehicles.

Mercedes-Benz, having assembled some electric models in India, including a variant of EQS, plans to continue its electric vehicle offensive in 2024 with multiple launches across segments from its global portfolio, according to Santosh Iyer, the company's Managing Director.

Tae-Jin Park, Managing Director & CEO of Kia in India, revealed plans for local production of electric vehicles starting in 2025. The company aims to introduce two locally-manufactured electric models initially, with more models to follow in subsequent years. Kia also expressed its intention to export electric vehicles manufactured in India. Park predicts that the electric passenger vehicle market is likely to reach 1 million units by 2030, within an overall industry scale of 5 million cars, including petrol, diesel, and hybrid versions.

Here's remembering a few of them: 1. Junior Mehmood: The child star of films such as 'Caravan', 'Brahmachari' and 'Mera Naam Joker' in the late 1960s and early 1970s died on December 8 following a battle with cancer. He was 68.

His credits also include 1980s Hindi films such as 'Suhaag', 'Dillagi', as well as shows 'CID' and 'Hello Inspector', but his manipulative uncle act as Shakuni mama from BR Chopra's ""Mahabharat"" made him a household name.

5. Sulochana: The actor, known for her innumerable mother roles in Hindi and Marathi cinema, died on June 4 due to prolonged illness at a hospital in Mumbai. She was 94.

Some of her films include 'Sasurvas', 'Vahinichya Bangdya', and 'Dhakti Jau' in Marathi as well as 'Aaye Din Bahar Ke', 'Gora Aur Kala', 'Devar', 'Talaash', and 'Azaad' in Hindi.

He made his directorial debut in 2000 with 'Tere Liye', but gained prominence two years later with ""Dhoom"", which made motorbiking a rage among Indian youth at the time. Its success spawned a film franchise with him directing its superhit sequel ""Dhoom 2"".

7. Seema Deo: Best remembered for her roles in 'Anand' and 'Kora Kagaz', the actor died on August 24 due to age-related ailments at the age of 81. She had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease for over three years. Deo acted in over 80 Hindi and Marathi films.

Khakhar hit the headlines in early 2021 after a tweet from a film journalist, informing the industry that the actor was looking for work, caught the attention of colleagues. The actor was most recently seen in the Prime Video series 'Farzi', starring Shahid Kapoor.

9. Pamela Chopra: Chopra, playback singer, writer and late filmmaker Yash Chopra's wife, died on April 20 at a Mumbai hospital where she was admitted after being diagnosed with pneumonia. She was 74.

She sang many songs for her husband's films, including 'Khud Se Jo Vada Kiya Tha' in 'Silsila' and 'Ghar Aaja Pardesi' in 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jaayenge'. She is also credited as story writer of 'Kabhie Kabhie', Yash Chopra's 1976 directorial.

Jairam was 77 and was living alone at a downtown apartment, where she was found dead, police said, adding there was an injury on her forehead and further investigation is on.

This year, the Hindi entertainment industry also lost art director Nitin Desai, veteran lyricist Dev Kohli, and actors Birbal, Javed Khan Amrohi, Nitesh Pandey, Vaibhavi Upadhyay, Dinesh Phadnis and Rio Kapadia."

The actor was one of the many personalities from different walks of life who shared their tips on fitness in the 108th episode of the broadcast, the last for the year 2023.

Akshay, 56, thanked the prime minister for giving him a platform in 'Mann Ki Baat' to share his thoughts with the citizens.

""You all know I'm passionate about fitness, but I'm even more passionate about staying fit the natural way. What I like more than fancy gyms is swimming, playing badminton, climbing stairs, exercising with 'mudgar', eating good healthy food...

""Change your lifestyle on the advice of doctors and not by looking at some film star's body. Actors are often not what they appear on screen. Many types of filters and special effects are used and after seeing them, we start using shortcuts to change our body,"" the actor said.

Akshay also cautioned the listeners about taking shortcuts in their fitness journey.

""Nowadays, many people take steroids and go for these six packs and eight packs. Friends, with such shortcuts the body swells from outside but remains hollow from inside. Remember that shortcuts can cut your life short. You need long-lasting fitness, not shortcuts...

""Like, I believe pure ghee, if eaten in the right quantity, is beneficial for us. But I see many boys and girls do not eat ghee because they fear they might become fat. It is very important for us to know what is good and what is bad for our fitness,"" he added.

The actor likened fitness to ""devotion"".

""It shouldn't be like instant coffee or two-minutes noodles. In this new year, promise yourself no chemicals, no shortcut, exercise, yoga, good food, sleeping on time, some meditation and most importantly, happily accept how you look. After today, don't live a filter life, live a fitter life,"" Akshay said.

During the broadcast of Mann Ki Baat, Isha Foundation founder Sadhguru, Indian Women's Cricket Team Captain Harmanpreet Kaur and chess legend Vishwanathan Anand also shared their fitness tips."

Gold had a strong run in 2023, outperforming commodities, bonds and select equities, Amit Khare, Associate Vice President at Ganganagar Commodity Limited (GCL) Broking said, as he sees the 2024 outlook to be impacted by a host of triggers.

""The outlook for gold in 2024 remains influenced by a complex interplay of economic, geopolitical, and market factors. Gold, traditionally viewed as a safe-haven asset, may see increased demand if global economic uncertainties persist. Inflation concerns, currency fluctuations, and geopolitical tensions could drive investors towards gold as a hedge,"" Khare said.

Further, the likelihood of the Fed steering the US economy to a safe landing with interest rates above 5% is by no means certain and a global recession is still on the cards, he said further adding that this should encourage many investors to hold effective hedges, such as gold, in their portfolios.

In his view, the technical chart looks positive overall and the MCX gold could test Rs 67,000-69,000 levels. The levels for entry are between Rs 62,000 and Rs 60,000.

On the daily chart, Gold December contract has formed a dark cloud cover candlestick pattern indicating bearishness and currently the price is trading above its 21 & 50 days EMA, Neha Qureshi, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst, Anand Rathi Commodities & Currencies said. Moreover, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is forming a negative divergence, indicating a bearish outlook, she warned.

The Anand Rathi Analyst sees resistance at Rs 63,820 - Rs 64,460 and support around Rs 62,900 - 62,650.

Gold futures on the MCX ended 2023 with gains of 15.22% or by Rs 8,372 per 10 grams, Anuj Gupta, Head Commodity & Currency, HDFC Securities said. Meanwhile, silver futures have appreciated by nearly Rs 5,546 or 7.99% in value terms in the year gone by, the commodity and currency analyst said.

Price of gold in major physical bullion markets like Delhi, Ahmedabad and other cities is Rs 64,000 per 10 grams while those of 1 kg of silver is Rs 76,000. Click to know more

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/new-updates/four-nostradamus-predictions-for-2024-did-his-forecasts-for-2023-come-true/articleshow/106274157.cms,"Nostradamus, the renowned French astrologer and seer from the 16th century, continues to captivate the world even after his death. His enigmatic writings, published in 1555 as Les Propheties, have been interpreted in different ways and debated for centuries. From predicting historical events like the Great Fire of London to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to the rise of Adolf Hitler, Nostradamus has left an indelible mark on our collective imagination. Because he wrote in cryptic poems or quatrains, his words possess the quality of being perpetually open to reinterpretation to align with historical occurrences. Evaluating his 'accuracy' becomes a notoriously challenging task due to this characteristic.


Did his predictions for 2023 come true?
One of his predictions that seems to resonate with our current times is the grim foresight of rising costs of living, according to Sky History. Nostradamus wrote, ""So high will the bushel of wheat rise / That man will be eating his fellow man."" While this prophecy remains metaphorical, it sheds light on the financial hardships many people face today, as headline news often covers mind-boggling inflation in many countries. The other predictions of Nostradamus for 2023 included a great war, worsening climate crisis and growing civil unrest.


Climate disaster in 2024?
Another intriguing prediction revolves around climate catastrophe. Nostradamus seemed to have foreseen the severe weather events we are experiencing today, such as violent storms, wildfires, and soaring temperatures. He wrote quatrains that mention the parched earth and great floods. He also warned of a ""Very great famine through pestiferous wave,"" which could refer to tsunamis devastating agriculture and leading to disease and starvation, according to Sky History. If his visions are accurate, we may expect even more calamitous climate events in the coming years.

More geopolitical conflicts in 2024?
Nostradamus' prophecies also touch on potential geopolitical conflicts. With China's rise as a global power, experts have speculated about a new Cold War between China and the United States. Nostradamus' quatrains include lines that mention ""combat and naval battle"" and a ""Red adversary"". Could the ""Red adversary"" represent communist China, and does the quatrain allude to a confrontation at sea. Given China's significant naval capabilities, the possibility of a diplomatic incident or worse cannot be ruled out.

Royal Tumult in 2024?
Furthermore, Nostradamus' writings hint at potential royal tumult. While some interpretations suggest the death of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022, it is more likely a testament to the clairvoyance of Nostradamus commentator Mario Reading. However, Nostradamus does mention a figure known as the ""King of the Isles,"" who faces controversy and is eventually driven out by force. This figure is replaced by someone ""who will have no mark of a king."" Reading's analysis suggests that this could refer to King Charles III being forced to abdicate, with Prince Harry taking the crown instead of Prince William. But this may seem unlikely given recent events.

A new Pope in 2024?
Nostradamus addresses the possibility of a new Pope in 2024, according to Sky History. With Pope Francis in his mid-80s and facing health issues, a transition in the Holy See might be on the horizon. However, he also warns that this new leader will ""weaken his see"" and hold the position for a long time. The exact meaning of ""weaken"" remains open to interpretation

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/stock-markets-off-to-weak-start-on-first-day-of-trade-of-2024/articleshow/106433458.cms,"Mumbai, Equity benchmark indices declined in early trade on Monday, the first trading day of the New Year 2024, amid profit-taking after the recent sharp rally and lack of trends from global markets. In 2023, the BSE benchmark jumped 11,399.52 points or 18.73 per cent, and the Nifty climbed 3,626.1 points or 20 per cent.


On Monday, the 30-share BSE Sensex fell 207.29 points to 72,032.97 after a muted beginning. The Nifty declined 46.65 points to 21,684.75.


""As the New Year begins it is a Goldilocks scenario for the economy and markets. The growth momentum in the economy is strong. 7% GDP growth in FY24 is likely to be followed by around 6.7% growth in FY25 with decent corporate earnings growth. The banking system is in the pink of health and all macroeconomic indicators are stable. Political stability after the General elections looks almost certain,” said Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.

Among the Sensex firms, Hindustan Unilever, Mahindra & Mahindra, Wipro, Axis Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, NTPC, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank were the major laggards.

Tata Motors, Nestle, IndusInd Bank and Power Grid were among the winners. Asian markets were closed on Monday for the New Year.

The US markets ended marginally lower on Friday.

Global oil benchmark Brent crude declined 0.14 per cent to USD 77.04 a barrel.

According to exchange data, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) bought equities worth Rs 1,459.12 crore on Friday.

The BSE benchmark fell 170.12 points or 0.23 per cent to settle at 72,240.26 on the last trading day of 2023 on Friday. The Nifty declined 47.30 points or 0.22 per cent to settle at 21,731.40.

Most experts however expect a correction in the stock markets this year due to stretched valuations. But they also insist that macroeconomic factors will continue to offer support to the benchmark indices.

“With macro-economic factors beginning to turn positive, falling US bond yields have once again fueled robust foreign fund inflows into the Indian market. Along with that, sliding crude oil prices is likely to keep inflation under check, all of which should augur well for Indian equity markets going ahead. Hence, the rally in the market is likely to further continue over the next 3-6 months and Sensex & Nifty could see another 5-7% appreciation while mid-cap & small-cap indices may witness another 10-15% jump. In times of correction, exposure to quality stocks in the above sectors would benefit investors,” said Rakeshh Mehta, Chairman of Mehta Equities.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/why-shimla-saw-the-lowest-hotel-occupancy-in-40-years-on-new-years-eve/articleshow/106433033.cms,"Despite the anticipation of weekend snow and the Chief Minister's instructions to treat revelers leniently on New Year, Shimla struggled to attract tourists, recording over 60 percent hotel occupancy until Sunday evening—its lowest in the past 40 years, Press Trust of India reported, citing hoteliers. In contrast, the previous year saw Shimla with an occupancy rate exceeding 80 percent on New Year's Eve.

While the Mall Road and The Ridge in the city center were lively with tourists enjoying the winter carnival's lights and cultural events, this influx did not translate into increased hotel room occupancy, according to M K Seth, president of the Shimla Hotel and Tourism Stakeholders Association. Seth noted that the current 60 percent occupancy is the lowest in four decades, even compared to the New Year during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Seth revealed that vehicles without prior bookings were initially diverted by the police at Shoghi, not realizing that a majority of New Year tourists are spontaneous, impacting the rush to the main city. The matter was resolved after discussions with the Superintendent of Police.

Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu had directed to follow the hospitality slogan 'Atithi Devo Bhava' and ensure smooth traffic flow with adequate arrangements in all districts. The state authorities had also allowed food joints and pan shops to remain open 24x7.

Seth also said that touts also guided tourists to unregistered accommodations, affecting the sales of registered hotels, home stays, and other establishments.

Tourists preferring isolated accommodations in the suburbs and those planning private parties beyond the city further contributed to the trend.

Tourism stakeholders attributed adverse publicity on social media and electronic channels regarding traffic jams to diverting tourists to other destinations. Videos of stranded vehicles due to traffic jam had also impacted room occupancy in Shimla and other parts of Himachal.

According to details of the assets of the chief minister and his cabinet colleagues posted on the Cabinet Secretariat Department's website on Sunday evening, Kumar has Rs 22,552 in cash, and deposits of Rs 49,202 in different bank accounts.

He also has a Ford Ecosport car worth Rs 11.32 lakh, two gold rings and a silver ring worth Rs 1.28 lakh, and other movable assets such as 13 cows and 10 calfs worth Rs 1.45 lakh, a treadmill, an exercise cycle and a microwave oven.

The only immovable property that he has is an apartment in Dwarka in New Delhi, which cost him Rs 13.78 lakh in 2004, and is now worth Rs 1.48 crore.

Last year, Kumar had declared total assets of Rs 75.53 lakh. A comparison of the two disclosures showed that the jump in the value of assets was primarily due to the rise in the worth of his Delhi apartment.

Kumar's government has made it mandatory for all cabinet ministers to disclose their assets and liabilities on the last day of every calendar year.

Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Prasad Yadav declared a total income of Rs 4.74 lakh for the 2022-23 financial year. His elder brother Tej Pratap, who is also a minister in the state government, has assets worth Rs 3.58 crore.

I really admire Delhi Winter and in this cold weather, hot tips from Bhasin Saab!
Sanjiv Bhasin: We are looking forward to a superb 2024 after a rocking 2023. And, like we said, take it with a pinch of salt and remember that you have to also protect your profits. Markets are friendly to those who know how to fine-tune themselves and be disciplined and the discipline means that in the last two-three years, realise that we are headed higher and you stayed invested. Staying invested is the only mantra.

You can keep having bouts of profit booking and so on, but we are in a bull market and we are well-placed to be an outperformer but with a pinch of salt as we have already run up a lot and in select midcaps and smallcaps. You must have a little bit of a cautionary approach. But no complaints. Look forward to a superb 2024 where good health, wealth and prosperity pertains.

Which are the stocks you would say have the potential to become stock of the year?
Sanjiv Bhasin: My Diwali pick and most hated name, Vodafone, has the potential to hit Rs 22 but be watchful. The potential in these stocks will be realised over a period of time. Similarly, I have been bullish on two other names, IEX on your platform itself at Rs 120-125. It has just scaled a new high at Rs 170 and has a potential to hit Rs 250.

However, like we said, these stocks have been outperformers. You will have to buy a little bit now and wait for corrections. But keep the faith and try and do your research work.

IDFC First doesn’t have room for upside; go for 2 stocks that can double in 2024: Sanjiv Bhasin

Two other big names which I have already given you, SW Solar which I am very bullish on and expect to double over this year and DCB Bank. If you have to put in new money, then DCB and Solar are two stocks which we think will double. As a disclosure, all these four stocks are in our portfolio and we remain very optimistic on this space or the perspective of the businesses.

Let us look at DCB. Why now? Why was this not on your radar last year at the same time?
Sanjiv Bhasin: Correct. Now, when the promoter starts to infuse capital, he is seeing more bullishness. He is putting his money where his mouth is. The bank may have been a relative underperformer for no specific reasons, but the flow of money into midcap PSUs and PSUs basket has seen a large part of the midcap private banks being underperformers.

Trading at 0.9 times price-to-book, having a book of over Rs 1 lakh crore, as we are seeing the runaway success in two-wheeler, three-wheeler, gold loan, agri loan, all these businesses fit perfectly into DCB Bank. If you went to a couple of commercial centres in Mumbai, DCB Bank is garnering a large part of the MSME and retail flows.

This bank fits all the parameters perfectly to be an outperformer in 2024. There is hardly any risk as its capital is much more adequate than needed. A promoter, as a disclosure, has just put in money at 137, the highest in the last one year and beside that, the business franchise is doing extremely well.

These 2 new age tech stocks are favourites of Gautam Shah for 2024

What could be the group of the year for 2024?
Sanjiv Bhasin: Well, you will have to take it in two parts. One, the market cap of certain Tata stocks, TCS, Tata Motors and the other group companies are far larger than smaller groups. And on a base, it is not easy for Reliance to jump 30% in a year. It does that once in three years, so 11% is what Reliance did, which is a moderate gain and you have seen transition of the business from oil to chemical, into telecom, into retail, into new energy. I think, at least till March-April, it belongs to Reliance and Adani because if the index has to do well, largecap stocks will have to do much better.

Midcaps have seen a disproportionate gain, more so because of low ownership. The market cap of PSUs has gone up from something like Rs 1.5-1.70 lakh crore to almost Rs 4.5-5 lakh crore. They have been triplers if you just took the PSU basket. It is telling us that the market realised undervaluation and value got neglected in front of growth. Value got preference ahead of growth. I would say it should be Reliance and the Adani group in the next four months.

Do you think the kind of up move that we have seen in terms of the hospitality stocks is going to get stronger and would you prefer Indian Hotels as one of the top bets within the hospitality sector?
Sanjiv Bhasin: Right now, there is a lot of pent-up demand. There is bonhomie as a wealth effect of both gold and stocks and real estate doing well and people have actually spent where they wanted to. This whole unbundling of Covid meant that we do not know about lifestyle but we want to at least enjoy what we have within our means and that meant slightly going overboard rather than saving but on your expenses and who best to spend then in this entertainment of travel, tourism, hotels.

Indian Hotels is a no-brainer still even though it is an expensive stock, we have had this. In 2021, it was my top Diwali pick at Rs 140 and look where the stock has reached and average room rates and costs are fixed. But if room rates have gone from to Rs 35,000, you can imagine how the money is going. But like I said, these are not very sustainable levels in the sense that there is a weather effect, there is a holiday fever and if I saw what the new launches of DLF are in Gurgaon and beyond in some of the ancillary areas, they are actually touching the peak.

Now, these are telling me that builders are also going overboard on the party and that may not last because do not make it so unaffordable that tomorrow if anything turns, then you will be again stuck with the high inventory and investors lose faith. So, we are bullish on select stocks. Indian Hotels is in our portfolio, but we do not want to delve into secondary names, stay with the market leaders. IndiGo, Ashok Leyland and Indian Hotels are three stocks which are a proxy to rising spending on entertainment and the likes.

Can Paytm give a 60% return? That is the consensus number which we have got for Paytm because for the year gone by the stock frankly has done nothing. I am using 20% as the benchmark. If you have done 20% last year, you have underperformed. If you have done anything above 50%, you are with the crowd. If you have done anything above 70%, then you have outperformed in the small and the midcap space.
Sanjiv Bhasin: Yes, so, firstly, we have Paytm in our portfolio. We are adding it at these prices on a SIP basis. Let us take it with a pinch of salt that it was at Rs 400, it went to Rs 1,000 and in the last month, it has corrected from Rs 900 level to 600 level. I am not saying 59%, I am saying 100%. This stock will double and it is in your day-to-day lives. It is just a matter of time as the transition moves. Their QR and their technology is unbeatable and the number of the book size which will, their NBFC arm will gain more traction because the transaction quantum will become large. So, I am extremely bullish, but I am also invested in this stock.

So, I have a biased interest. My clients are going to look at the next three years, not maybe this year. But I do not rule this stock going back to that 1500 level maybe in the next two years and if bonhomie remains and we get a better traction on the book size, their QR volume is growing, this stock can be a huge outperformer. Along with that, let me also add, I think another pick from my midcap stable is Can Fin Homes.

We have seen the transition of most of the mortgage companies move into digital and the space at which Can Fin Homes has become technology driven is amazing. From my recent interaction, after that one-off fiasco of a couple of accounts and some problem on their people on their payroll taking advantage which led to a wrong deal and some misappropriation, all transactions are now on technology, which means the head office monitors each and every disbursement .

If you are seeing bullishness on real estate, then Can Fin Homes is a stock which perfectly fits from 777 going to 1000 rupees, that would be my midcap bet and I think all the parameters are firing on all cylinders for this stock to be the best performing mortgage company stock."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/trade/exports/insights/demand-uptick-easing-inflation-in-developed-mkts-to-provide-silver-lining-for-exports-in-2024/articleshow/106433905.cms,"Easing inflation in developed countries, softening interest rates, a gradual pick up in global demand and other factors will provide a silver lining for the country's exports and the overall outbound shipments are expected to be more than USD 900 billion in 2024. International trade experts have expressed hope that the services sector would perform better than merchandise and the country's overall outbound shipments may touch over USD 900 billion in 2024 against an estimated USD 764 billion in 2023.

A stable rupee against the US dollar, focus on new markets like Latin America and Africa, new items like mobiles and fresh fruits, focus on promoting e-commerce exports, free trade agreements with the UAE and Australia would also help the country register healthy growth in outbound shipments next year.

Despite various challenges, including geopolitical tensions and China's subdued post-pandemic recovery, impacting exports this year, India's goods and services exporters have managed to tap opportunities in developed as well developing economies.

The current year started with negative growth in exports, with the decline touching about 19 per cent in June but the decline narrowed down to 2.83 per cent in November 2023.

An official said goods exports rose 6.21 per cent in October ""and going forward, this trend will continue in 2024 also and along with goods, services exports too are growing"".

Electrical and electronics, machinery, automobile and auto components, high tech products, pharmaceuticals, medical and diagnostic equipment exports are likely to go further in 2024.

Experts suggested focusing on new products and new destinations to give push to exports of goods and services.

""India's trade performance in 2024 will be influenced by a blend of domestic and international factors, set against a backdrop of global economic uncertainties. But as India's share in world trade is just 2 per cent, focus on enhancing sectoral competitiveness in labour intensive sectors and diversification of services sectors can surprise us with some good export performance,"" think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava said.

He said India's trade scenario in 2023 mirrored the global trend, experiencing a 5.3 per cent fall in merchandise exports, aligned with a global 5 per cent decline as per UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development).

This decrease was notable despite the rupee's depreciation against the US dollar, which generally aids export competitiveness.

""The decline was particularly evident in labour-intensive sectors like textiles and leather. India's overall trade in 2023 remained at the same level as the previous year, indicating a need for strategic efforts to improve in 2024,"" Srivastava added.

Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) Director General Ajay Sahai said since inflation is moderating globally and after a pause in key rates by most of the central banks, interest rates are likely to move southward thus pushing demand.

""New orders with large volumes are expected in 2024, thus pushing our exports. We should look at goods and services exports of USD 900 billion plus in 2024,"" Sahai said.

However, he added that the Red Sea problem might affect exports in the short run with lack of container availability and rising freight cost.

""The freight to many destinations has almost doubled and we are apprehensive that they may remain at an elevated level in the next few months. A better trend of 2024 will be discernible by mid-March,"" Sahai said.

Lakshmi Venkataraman Venkatesan, Founding and Managing Trustee of Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST), an organisation that works for micro, and rural entrepreneurs from across the country, said the government had set the target of increasing MSME share in exports to at least 60 per cent in the next five years and this can be met by tapping into the potential in sectors like readymade garments, leather goods, processed foods, and engineering items for export to BRICS and G20 nations.

Trade expert and Hi-Tech Gears Chairman Deep Kapuria said new emerging sectors like mobile phones and electronics have contributed to India's export growth.

""However, the major challenge is to sustain this growth momentum. This is all the more important in view of the USD 2 trillion export target for both goods and services by 2030. Going forward, India needs to further step up its efforts to bring more products under Quality Control Order (QCOs) as this would enable our MSMEs to get integrated into Global Value Chains (GVCs), a major vehicle to boost exports,"" Kapuria said.

Mumbai-based exporter and Chairman of Technocraft Industries Sharad Kumar Saraf said order books are good at present as demand is gradually increasing from countries like the US and Europe.

The government has taken several measures to promote India's export and that includes announcing new Foreign Trade Policy; promoting districts as export hubs; providing more funds to the Interest Equalisation Scheme on pre- and post-shipment rupee export credit; financial assistance under Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) and Market Access Initiatives (MAI) Scheme; and increasing role of Indian missions abroad."

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/for-smartwatch-brands-2024-to-be-a-year-of-make-or-break/articleshow/106431459.cms,"New Delhi: Year 2024 could be an inflection point in the smartwatch industry that may see trader brands exiting the market due to low margins and a declining profit in the business, say industry executives and analysts.

The smartwatch segment is being treated as part of the fast-moving fashion and lifestyle industry, though it is a technology segment, and brands are caught in a vicious cycle of high-speed launches at low prices with minimal changes, while spending more on marketing, to stay abreast, industry executives said.

“Fashion brands keep a high margin of 60-65% to accommodate for the variations they need to make in their products, all of which might not sell. But to do that for smartwatches, where margins are at best 20-25%, it starts eating into your unit economics,” said Sameer Mehta, chief executive at Imagine Marketing that owns the Boat electronics brand.

This cycle will hurt brands that are in the business of trading, where they place big orders to original device makers in China which keep coming up with new products, and sell them in India at a slight markup, making some to exit or pivot to other segments this year as profits start to dry up, he said.

“Some of the wearable brands have ten different apps on the app store, because they buy from ten different suppliers. There are instances where the exact product can be seen being sold by another brand in China,” said another top executive from a wearable brand.

“Without R&D, without manufacturing, wearable brands will not be able to survive in the coming years. Time is running out for them,” this executive added.

Smartwatch shipments, although the fastest growing in the wearables category, have seen a sharp decline in the pace of growth. The segment grew 41% on-year in the July-September quarter of 2023 to 16.9 million units, after charting 179% growth in the same period of 2022 to 12 million unis, as per IDC India.

At the same time, the average selling price of smartwatches dropped 35.3% on-year in the third quarter to $26.70 (around Rs 2,200) from $41.90 (around Rs 3,400), according to the research firm.

Mehta said there are now signs of the segment starting to slow down, as consumers start demanding better experiences once the initial hype dies down. “Customers now want products that have the metrics they want to track, the watch faces they design as a community, and overall a well-integrated product that serves their needs,” Mehta said.

It will soon be no longer about the sizes and colours, he said, comparing it to the smartphone industry where hardware specifications are now slowly giving way to software experiences.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/planning-to-buy-real-estate-stock-in-2024-godrej-properties-sunteck-realty-could-rally-14-40-in-1-year/articleshow/106432521.cms,"The listed real estate companies witnessed sustained demand traction as they delivered 36% YoY growth in pre-sales to reach Rs 427 bn in 1HFY24.

In the same period, Bengaluru-focused companies reported 63% YoY growth in bookings. Despite seasonality, cumulative sales from the top-listed companies rose 44% Q-o-Q in 2QFY24 as GPL, PEPL, and PURVA posted a standout performance backed by new launches that enabled them to double their bookings YoY.

With 54% of FY23 bookings already achieved in 1HFY24, the listed universe (top 12 players) remains on track to surpass the FY24 guidance of 15-20% growth.

At the beginning of FY24, we had estimated a 15% pre-sales growth for the coverage companies based on the guidance and project pipeline, implying a 500bp drop in churn to 42%.

Companies covered under Universe launched ~ Rs 260 bn worth of projects and reported an average absorption of 60%, contributing to 44% of overall pre-sales in 1HFY24.

Strong momentum in ongoing projects sustained and contributed 56% to overall pre-sales, leading to a decline in inventory to ~ Rs 610 bn from ~Rs 720 bn.

After the strong performance in 1HFY24 and given the healthy launch pipeline of 60msf for 2H, we now estimate that bookings for our coverage universe could grow 29% YoY to Rs 851 bn, implying a churn rate of 47% (similar to FY23 level).

The absorption for the top-7 cities has averaged ~130,000 units over the last four quarters vs. ~110,000 units in the preceding four quarters. Absorption is now expected to pick up further once interest rates start declining in 2HFY25.

As the rate hike cycle has peaked, we believe the residential real estate cycle is unlikely to face any significant headwinds. We expect demand to remain healthy for at least the next 2-3 years.

Most of the listed companies are trading above the value of their existing pipelines, so we prefer companies that can outperform their peers and whose valuations do not reflect this outperformance.

Over FY20-23, the listed players have outperformed the industry growth in terms of bookings by 1.5x, resulting in a consistent increase in their market share to 16% from 12% (this stood at 16.5% at the end of 1HFY24).

During this period, sales across the top 7 cities recorded a 22% CAGR with cities like NCR, Pune and Hyderabad witnessing ~2x jump in sales since the pandemic.

With interest headwinds behind and improving affordability, the industry is likely to maintain healthy growth at least in the near term.

Most of the listed peers have a very strong launch pipeline and are targeting at least two new markets apart from their home market, which will lead to a further pick-up in the market share of the listed peers.

Godrej Properties: Buy| Target Rs 2300| LTP Rs 2012| Upside 14%

GPL has achieved 52% of its annual pre-sales target and has given a strong launch pipeline of 16msf in 2HFY24, it can comfortably exceed its guidance for FY24.

The management intends to launch the recently acquired projects on priority, which would accelerate the booking growth and enable higher cash flow given the favorable ownership of new projects.

Sustained traction in BD continues to provide strong visibility on pre-sales growth. Further, improvement in profitability led by higher completion of projects with favorable ownership augurs well for the stock.

Sunteck Realty Ltd: Buy| Target Rs 640| LTP Rs 445| Upside 43%

It is one of the leading real estate developers in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), which is the largest micro-market in the country.

MMR has reported 70% higher absorption than pre-Covid levels. Sunteck’s multi-micro-market presence, luxury offerings across price points, and proven execution track record have made it one of the biggest beneficiaries of the strong demand.

The company is likely to post 25% CAGR over FY23-26, as it is gearing up for 2-3 new project launches.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/after-partying-hard-in-dec-will-equity-bulls-turn-fatigue-in-new-year-see-what-history-shows/articleshow/106432098.cms,"MUMBAI - December turned out to be the best month for Dalal Street in the last one-and-a-half years, as benchmark Nifty 50 clocked about 8% gains, led by robust domestic and foreign capital flows. December was also the best month in 2023 for markets.

But after partying hard in the last couple of months, fatigue among bulls is likely to be seen entering into the New Year, shows various data indicators.

In 2023, the 50 stock index registered a staggering 20% gains, with nearly 14% gains coming in the last two months of the year.

In the backdrop of this and the key events lined up early next year, market participants expect some consolidation.

“2024 could be a year of lower returns as compared to 2023. This is because some of the tailwinds which caused this year’s outperformance (lower , easy domestic liquidity, certainty on political front) are likely to be missing next year,” said Niket Shah, fund manager at Motilal Oswal Asset Management.



The strong rally in equities in the last two months was backed by relentless inflows from foreign and domestic institutional investors.

net bought equities worth a whopping $6.9 billion in December, the highest monthly purchase in a month in 2023. In 2023, they pumped in nearly $24 billion into the domestic market.

The derivatives data further showed that FIIs significantly increased their net long positions in the January series.

“Such a pronounced bias (of FIIs) can introduce volatility and potential market unease, in my view,” said Abhilash Pagaria of Nuvama Quantitative Research.

Historical pattern of FII and DII flows in the month of January also shows volatility in investments.

In the last 12 years, FIIs were net sellers of shares in January during 5 instances, while DIIs sold in 6 instances.



While FIIs are entering the New Year with a bullish bias, there are certain key events that will influence their investment decision in January.

The third quarter earnings of companies will kickstart from the second week of January. Further, investors will also look at rejigging their portfolio ahead of the interim budget on February 1. A slew of macroeconomic data points, including inflation, industrial output, automobile sales, etc will also be out during the course of the month.

On the global front, the US Federal Reserve’s two-day monetary policy meeting will take place at the end of the month, and the decision will be announced on January 31.

All the above-mentioned factors are likely to bring in some volatility in equities and result in consolidation.


If one looks at the historical data, then January has been a month of weak returns for Dalal Street investors.

In the last 12 years, Nifty 50 has given negative returns in 7 instances in January. Infact, it has given negative returns for 5 years in a row between 2019 and 2023.



“Historically January has been a weak month in terms of return seasonality and, hence, going by the larger trend, we anticipate some in the latter half. Moreover, at the onset of Q3 FY24 earnings season, participants will look for cues,” said Sriram Velayudhan of IIFL Securities.


Given that key events are lined up for the month, experts recommend adopting a stock-specific approach and switching bets to largecaps.

“We prefer increasing exposure to large-caps (over smallcap/micro-caps) and value stocks at reasonable prices away from growth stocks trading at steep valuations,” brokerage Sharekhan said.

In terms of sectors, the brokerage sees better times for pharma, two-wheeler automobiles, and IT services, in addition to its core multi-year investment themes of capex, capital and consumer."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/senior-manipur-newspaper-editor-wangkhecha-shamjai-released-on-bail/articleshow/106432453.cms,"Guwahati: A court in Imphal on Sunday granted bail to senior editor Wangkhemcha Shamjai, who was arrested for publishing an alleged incendiary report recently in his paper, Kangleipakki Meira, a vernacular evening daily.

Imphal police on Friday arrested Shamjai, former president of the All Manipur Working Journalists’ Union (AMWJU) , an umbrella body of the scribes of the state. On the same day, he was remanded in three days police custody by the court.

Shamjai (67) was produced before the Judicial Magistrate First Class ( Imphal West-II) by the Investigating Officer (IO) of the case on Sunday. He is a resident of the Mongshangei area in Imphal West.

Considering the submissions made by the prosecution and Shamjai’s counsel, the court maintained that it is in the view that the accused person (Shamjai) being a senior citizen and being deeply rooted in the society, is not flight risk and also has an issue of heart problem, as such there would be no chance of him in hampering or tempering the investigation.

Moreover, the accused is willing to cooperate with the investigation and is ready to furnish surety bond, said the court.

Upon this, the court granted bail to Shamjai on personal bond of Rs 50,000 with a surety bond of like amount on certain conditions among others that he should not “directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person/witness of the prosecution.”

He should not try to hamper the investigation or temper with the evidence and that he should co-operate with the IO for investigation and should also appear whenever the IO called for investigation.
Having granted bail, the court asked Shamjai to appear before the court on January 15 next year.

His arrest refers to a suo-moto case taken up by Imphal police station for a report published by Kangleipakki Meira which the police alleged could spark tension and promote enmity among communities.

Under sections 153/153-A/505(1)(b)/505(2) of the Indian Penal Code the police booked him.

Shamjai’s arrest drew criticisms from various sections, mostly from the media orgnisations – AMWJU, Editors’ Guild Manipur (EGM) and Paomi Welfare Foundation (PWF) , political leaders and some philanthropic organizations of which he is the president.
Shamjai is also the present chairperson of PWF, a trust set up for the welfare of AMWJU members.

The media bodies as well as Manipur PCC president and senior party legislator K Meghachandra, categorically condemned Shamjai’s arrest and sought for his conditional release."

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/manipur-cm-expresses-concern-over-attacks-on-state-forces/articleshow/106432060.cms,"Guwahati: Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh on Sunday said that the eight month long ethnic violence disrupted the fabric of peaceful co- existence different communities while development works and economic activities has been slowed down and it is not a good sign for the state.

The Chief Minister in his new year message said that for nearly eight months now, Manipur has been going through one of the worst phases in its history, with loss of many precious lives and many others uprooted from their homes.

“The unprecedented ethnic conflict has, directly or indirectly, affected everyone residing in the state. It is high time that we rise together to overcome the barriers and stumbling blocks in our journey towards a better Manipur, where all its people live together peacefully, harmoniously and get access to the facilities of a developed state.”

The Chief Minister said that Manipur had been witnessing a significant and sustained trend of visible and tangible development in recent years, with people from all communities contributing their parts in taking the state towards an upward growth trajectory.

Hosting various events like Business 20 Summit, Femina Miss India Grand Finale, Hero Tri-Nation International Football, Durand Cup and other events had showcased the improvement in the state's law-and-order situation and the capacity and ability to hold national and international events, Singh said in his message.

He said that the state government, with a mission-oriented mode, has been continuing its citizen welfare initiatives to ensure that no person or place is left out of its development radar.

Noting that as the year 2023 ends, let us forget and forgive the trauma of the past and start the New Year 2024 in an atmosphere of love and compassion, the Chief Minister said that with the onset of the New Year, “let us resolve to stand together, rise above all evil thoughts and work steadfast to take the State back to its earlier track of growth and development”."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/trade/exports/insights/china-factory-activity-posts-worst-contraction-in-six-months/articleshow/106432590.cms,"(Bloomberg) --China’s factory activity shrank in December to the lowest level in six months, fueling expectations the government may have to act soon to add impetus to the economy.

The official manufacturing purchasing managers index declined to 49, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement on Sunday. That was weaker than the median forecast of 49.6 by economists in a Bloomberg survey, and matched the reading seen in June.

A gauge of non-manufacturing activity rose to 50.4 from 50.2 in November, boosted by expansion in the construction sector as government-led infrastructure investment accelerated in recent months. Services activity, however, remained in contraction with an underlying measure staying at 49.3.
Bloomberg
Any reading above the 50 mark suggests an expansion from the previous month, while a figure below that denotes contraction.

The PMI figures provided more signs of weakness in China’s economic recovery in the final months of the year. They are also likely to add pressure on fiscal and monetary policymakers to act urgently, after leaders vowed to maintain a pro-growth stance in 2024.

“The weaker-than-expected PMI data showed growth momentum has declined further amid a low season and the cold weather,” said Xing Zhaopeng, a senior strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. “We can’t rule out the possibility that the central bank may cut rates in early January,” he said.

NBS analyst Zhao Qinghe said in a separate statement that “falling overseas orders coupled with insufficient effective domestic demand” was the biggest trouble reported by some companies in the official PMI survey. The textile and non-metal mineral product sectors were unable to make use of their full capacity due to subdued demand, Zhao added.

Weak demand and sluggish confidence has also been reflected in deepening consumer price deflation and shrinking imports. The worst property downturn in modern China is expected to persist, which will further curb demand for goods from furniture to home appliances.

A sub-index for factories’ new orders fell to 48.7 as demand weakened, while a gauge measuring new export orders contracted to 45.8.

For non-manufacturing sectors, a gauge of construction activity climbed to 56.9 from 55 in November, according to the NBS. Some analysts had expected construction momentum to remain robust as the government stepped up the effort to build more infrastructure projects with extra bond issuance.

Some services industries, such as air transport, lodging, and household services, lost steam as consumers reduced traveling due to cold weather, according to NBS’ Zhao."

We have collated a list of recommendations from top brokerage firms from ETNow and other sources:

Nomura on Fortis Healthcare: Buy| Target Rs 475
Nomura maintained a buy rating on Fortis Healthcare but raised the target to Rs 475 from Rs 388 earlier.

There are adequate levers in place to deliver margin expansion. The global investment bank sees the hospital segment's EBITDA margin to improve to 20.2% in FY25 from 16.9% in FY23.

Nomura sees improvement in ARPOB growth expectations over the medium term. Valuations have improved, which is in line with sector re-rating, but still cheaper than peers.


ICICI Securities initiated a buy on Cello World with a target of Rs 920. It is a unique consumption play and has a strong competitive advantage.

Industry growth is likely at 10%+ CAGR in FY23-27. The company has a multi-pronged strategy - distribution expansion, steady launches of differentiated products.

Drive export growth with the China+1 strategy. Also, see margin tailwinds in the near term with a correction in crude oil prices.


Morgan Stanley has a positive view on OMCs and the brokerage firm prefers HPCL, BPCL and IOC.

India's auto fuel prices are benchmarked to $90/bbl oil. Fuel retailer integrated margins are 2-2.5x above mid-cycle.

The investment case for OMCs is about higher refining margins, hardware upgrades, balance sheet debt de-leveraging, our integration into petrochemicals, and also improved FCF.


Emkay has a positive view on Emami with a target price of Rs 625. Emami’s ~13% up-move last week is largely a factor of attractive valuations.

“We maintain our positive stance on the stock, with TP of Rs625/share on 31x P/E (in line with its last 10-year average forward P/E), on the back of enhancement in execution, which though continues to be affected by weak seasonality,” said the note.

The management guidance of mid-to-high single-digit growth across segments in India over the medium term looks achievable. Given Emami’s healthy margin profile, we foresee positive movements in the topline trajectory.

“We remain hopeful of better seasonality ahead, wherein recovery in Rural makes Emami a strong play. Q3FY24 delivery is likely to be muted, given weak seasonality and a sustained slowdown in Rural demand,” said the note.

Any weakness in the stock from poor near-term delivery would be an ‘entry’ opportunity."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/food/with-attention-to-ingredients-procedure-local-pizzerias-bite-into-global-chains-market/articleshow/106428939.cms,"New Delhi: Amol Kumar doesn’t like talking about himself too much. He’d rather let his crafted pizzas do all the talking. The owner and chef of Leo’s Artisan Pizza spends most days making doughs, experimenting with artisanal flour and cheeses such as Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano, while training others to make pies like he does.

Delhi-based Leo’s was one of just two Indian brands that made it to a widely-followed ranking of top 50 pizzas in the Asia Pacific, six months ago. The other was Pizzeria Da Susy, based in Gurgaon.

These two pizzerias, based in the NCR, are among a crop of buzzy pie shops across the country that are winning over palates by upping the ante on quality, variety and taste, driven typically by a chef-entrepreneur passionate about cheeses, sauces and dough. Together, they are stealing away elite customers from conventional fast-food brands that dish out more staple fare that lends itself to standardisation.

Kumar, 37, told ET he named his company MLTP Hospitality after his four dogs’ initials. As for the secret to his success, “We give a lot of attention to artisan dough, hand-stretched bases and cured meats,” he said.

Homegrown makers, which have emerged as challengers to global brands, are looking to win over palates by giving serious attention to ingredients. For some, it’s the dough that’s the trade secret; for others, the toppings or crust, tomatoes or cheese. None of them wants to give away too much, wary about revealing their competitive edge.

Many have hired cheese artisans to curate platters of parmesan, mozzarella, bocconcini and burrata.

They are also running dough-stretching workshops, importing spices and herbs, training pizzaiolos (makers of pizza) in their kitchens, and betting on secret sauces to draw in consumers.

Pizza By The Bay and Joey’s in Mumbai; Da Suzy and Leo’s in Delhi-NCR; Tuscana Pizzeria in Chennai; The Blue Oven and Sam’s in Ahmedabad are among notable names that have emerged of late.

Ram Prasad, managing director at Chennai’s Tuscana Pizzeria, said his restaurants make gluten-free options, which are a big draw. “We are consistent in maintaining our recipe, taste and variety of bases — from regular, classic, wheat and multigrain,” he said.

Not a trained chef, Kumar of Leo’s — with outlets in Vasant Vihar and Ghitorni, besides a satellite kitchen in Amar Colony — began by making every pizza himself for the first two years. “It’s hard to standardise dough, and even now, I make the dough every other day,” he said. “We import hard cheeses such as Grana Padano and Parmigiano-Reggiano since we don’t know how to make them here. We source fresh buffalo mozzarella and burrata cheese locally.”

All cured meats and tomatoes are Italian, imported through distributors.

With low barriers to entry, the rush to pizzerias escalated in the post-Covid period. During the period, pizza lovers had been experimenting with cuisine, according to executives, seeding the ground for a better class of pies.

“It’s the different toppings that people want to improvise on, and they need flexibility there,” said Parmeet Sawhney, owner of Tonino in Delhi, which counts thin crust and square pizzas among its specialties. “Consumers are choosing varieties of different toppings, instead of the regular margaritas.”

According to restaurateur Zorawar Kalra, the foundation of his latest online-only, gourmet, hand-crafted pizza brand Slyce is dough and a secret sauce. Slyce, he said, has had a flying start in Mumbai and Delhi-NCR.

Global chains such as Domino’s and Yum Restaurants-operated Pizza Hut have acknowledged the threat of gourmet pizzerias. Domino’s, operated by Jubilant FoodWorks (JFL), is “doubling down” on its own gourmet pizzas.

“Gourmet pizza consumption is happening in 12-15 pincodes in India,” Sameer Batra, president and chief business officer of Domino’s India, said in a recent interview. “For those pincodes, we have launched new gourmet ranges, new types of cheese, changed toppings (and added) special varieties of tomatoes and sauces.”

ICICI Securities wrote in a December report that the pizza segment has witnessed higher consumption stress versus other sub-segments in quick service restaurants due to increased competition from regional players.

“While (there’s) overall awareness for Pizza Hut, it needs to improve on consideration. Given current demand pressure, Pizza Hut India is likely to be cautious in retail expansion, with closure of long non-performing stores,” the report said.



With patrons taking to pizza as a top dining choice, dozens of chefs are entering the business.

Chef Amit Puri, who began his career at Taj Hotels in Colaba, now runs his own hospitality consultancy firm In.Si.Vi.A. Hospitality. “The shift to gourmet has been accepted a lot more in metros and larger cities; the smaller cities, not so much,” he said. Puri attributes the trend to people travelling a lot more, social media and Instagram reels, availability of ingredients and spending power.

According to chef Satrujeet Das, who previously worked at the Oberoi Group of Hotels and the Bengaluru Marriott Hotel Whitefield, consumer preferences have switched to “crispy” pizzas, adding that they’re differentiating a lot more between gourmet and non-gourmet pizzas.

Most of the gourmet pizzerias have opted out of deliveries by aggregators. “I try not to work with aggregators because our pizzas won’t travel well on aggregators’ bikes,” said Kumar of Leo’s. Neither is he looking for scale just yet.

Tuscana is working to set up a few more outlets within the city and may look for sites elsewhere, said Prasad.

Gourmet pizza isn’t confined to domestic players though. Jamie’s has also been tapping the market and doing its bit to raise awareness. “Our superpower is Neapolitan pizzas, using fresh (not frozen) dough and a top-secret dough recipe,” said Jasper Reid, founder of Dolomite Hospitality, which operates 20 Jamie’s Oliver pizzerias in 12 cities. “The key is dough management, which is a science and an art, with varying degrees of expertise, when we stretch, toss, mold and fold the dough.”

While his chain imports tomato varieties such as San Marzano, the parmesan, mozzarella, bocconcini and burrata cheeses are sourced locally."

In 2024, gold is expected to give 10-11% returns with silver returns pegged at 12-15%.
Silver prices could see a breakout year in 2024, with good performance in the second half.
Gold may have outshined silver in 2023, but in the coming year, white metal may see asharper price hike, experts say. While gold gained as much as 14% during the year, silver price movement has not matched up pace. This may change and the white metal is expected to see a breakout.

It’s customary for silver prices to move with gold, but the former saw a rollercoaster ride with ups and downs – ending the year with 8% gains in 2023. On the other hand, gold’s safe haven status was greatly enhanced during the year due to geopolitical tensions, tight interest rates as well as central bank buying.

Silver safe, gold safest

Silver too saw a positive movement due to geopolitical tensions, decline in the US yield curve and the dollar index, among other factors that sparked the movement. But it did not react as sharply as gold, even as it too provides safe haven advantages.

But the coming year may see it shine as much or even brighter than gold. “Silver is a precious metal and also an industrial metal, so it is getting double tailwinds. It seems that the three-year consolidation (August 2020-December 2023) in silver prices is coming to an end. This is likely to get over in March,” expects Aprajita Saxena, research analyst at Trustline, an equity research and asset management firm.

Naveen Mathur, director of commodities & currencies at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers believes silver can give double digit gains in 2024. “Silver is also expected to remain a bright spot for 2024, as continued deficit projections along with investment demand may push the white metal to give further 12-15 % returns after having a bullish 2023,” he added.

Most experts believe that silver might start off with a tepid first half in 2024, but may gain slowly ahead. “Silver will initially underperform gold, but in the later half of the year, I will not be surprised if it outperforms gold. Once crude stabilizes, and comes under $75 all then all economic activities, and metals like silver and copper will pick up,” said Saxena.

Gold will keep up its run

The yellow metal on the other hand, is expected to sharpen its shine in 2024. In the last three weeks of December, investors doubled down bets on the precious metal. The Federal Reserve is expected to unwind its restrictive stance on monetary policy in 2024. Decline in yields which is expected to have peaked in the current quarter along with weaker dollar index also provided a boost to gold prices.

Experts feel that the metal still has juice left for investors. Treasury yields, declining US dollar, and expectations of lower interest rates in the upcoming year could keep supporting gold prices. Most experts expect gold to give as much as 10-11% returns in the coming year.

“When interest rates remain lower, inflation begins to increase, which subsequently lifts gold prices. In 2024, the Fed will remain dovish on monetary policy, which would be a favorable condition for gold's bull run,” said Nirpendra Yadav, senior commodity research analyst at Swastika Investmart.

The ongoing geopolitical issue may continue next year, which may elevate gold prices to higher levels. “Opportunities do exist for traders/investors to make fresh moves as new highs are still possible in the coming year in Gold amid probabilities of an interest rate cut as soon as March 2024 increasing with markets anticipating 6-7 rate cuts for 2024 resulting in a hard landing scenario,” said Mathur."

“We were able to manage this strong performance with our focus on identifying value underpriced stocks,” says Abhinandan Tulsian of Tulsian PMS. Tulsian believes India is in a multi-year bull run and recommends investors to look for sustainable growth companies for outperformance. Edited excerpts:


: We believe India is in a multi-year bull run and recommend investors to look for sustainable growth companies for outperformance. We are extremely bullish on select stocks, even though the view on the overall market is positive as well.

We typically invest in 10-15 stocks, so our returns do not necessarily move with the markets.


: Tulsian PMS has given a return of 47% until November compared to a Nifty 50 TRI return of 17%.

A few reasons why we were able to manage this strong performance is our focus on identifying value underpriced stocks. Ours is primarily a and mis-pricings do exist there as well.

We focus on companies where value unlocking is likely to happen while at the same time, build a core portfolio which provides stability, with focus on Capability and Corporate Governance. We currently have a 40%+ CAGR for the last 3 years which is a testament to our strong and independent research.


: Budget is no longer the single event that drives the market sentiment. Regulations are being updated in real time and not just once per year.

So, we do not believe that Budget will be a decisive one, especially since we expect continuity of government at the centre, which means one can expect continuity of policy making, which is always positive for the markets.

In February, it will be an interim Budget. So, entire energy will be put on the regular budget to be presented in the first week of July, after the general elections, which maybe comprehensive, as continuity of this government with higher numbers are expected.


: Our economy is one of the few amongst the large names showing accelerated growth. This bodes well for the markets, which in turn attract more capital.

Households are increasingly realizing that equity is a good long-term investment and moving some funds away from FDs, gold, real estate, which is driving domestic flows.

FII flows are likely to increase as well, both in the markets and in the form of FDI as an alternate to China. We do not see this trend changing for even the next few years, which will provide an additional tailwind to the markets.


: Our fund is sector agnostic and we have a positive view on diverse sectors. Our holdings range from capital goods, green energy, infrastructure, auto OEM and auto ancillaries and non-ferrous metal in the commodity space.

We only refrain from sin stocks and sectors, but apart from that, we are not averse to any sectors and these are our top picks currently.


: The Indian economy is on a long-term high growth trajectory. Any industry meeting the demands of the economy for the next 10-20 years is something we like.

These are not necessarily dependent on election results, but on the policy making direction.

For example, to meet the 2028/2030/2070 carbon and green targets, the country will need huge additional in renewable energy and electrification space. So, few of our portfolio are from this space.

Many of these companies are still mid sized and growing well and are ripe for returns in the future. So, we believe that such stories linked to fortunes of the country are likely to do well, irrespective of election results.


: Last few months has seen a strong run up, and many stocks have moved beyond their fair value, according to us. So, one must take cautious view and ensure to do thorough research rather than just extrapolating the price movement. Also, investors must engage in portfolio churn and profit booking rather than just sitting on the same stock for many years, since markets and environment is very dynamic and buy and forget may not work, if you are looking for outperformance.


: This is a fund philosophy related view and we as equity fund managers do not believe in holding cash. We instead churn portfolio to increase or decrease the risk weight, before events, to manage the risks.


: At the cost of sounding repetitive, I will advise clients to pick a core portfolio of blue chips which provide portfolio stability, but also have 4-5 stocks which are from sunrise sectors and likely to give alpha returns to the portfolio.

When one does the numbers for 15% vs 18% and 21% compounding, they will realize the importance of the few percentage points extra gains or returns, which can only be achieved consistently by identifying hidden gems."

There could be some time correction in mid and small caps during FY2024, not too much price correction, as SIP flows and retail participation in this space are pretty strong.


The is pretty heated up in general SME or Main Board IPOs. IPOs would in general be an avoid.


The pipeline for main board IPOs is on similar lines as CY23. Some companies in the IT space could be interesting.


PSUs still have a lot of value. They are likely to go up even from these levels.


Markets are unlikely to fall big

The reasons would be:-

a) Corporate Earnings growth strong

b) Interest rate cut expectations not yet built in valuations both globally and locally

c) The inflation situation is broadly stable. Don’t expect crude oil prices to flare up

d) Global macros are broadly stable including Russia Russia-Ukraine war.

e) Europe's macros have bottomed. China incentivizes growth.

The 30-share Sensex fell 170 points to settle at 72,240 and the wider Nifty declined 47 points to settle at 21,731.

The blue-chip NSE Nifty 50 fell 0.21% to 21,733.25 points, while the S&P BSE Sensex shed 0.22% to 72,249.79, as of 9:53 a.m. IST.

The Nifty and BSE Sensex have risen about 20% each this year and are on course for their best month of 2023 with 8% gains.

Stocks that were in focus include names like Tata Consumer, which rose 4.61%, , which jumped 3.38%, and , whose shares gained 8% on Friday.

Here's what Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today.


It has witnessed a breakout of a triangle formation on the longer timeframe with a strong volume and successfully closed above Rs 800 levels. After that, it formed a higher highs and higher lows formation. The structure of the counter is good for long-term investors as it is trading above its important moving averages (50, 100, and 200-DMA).

The momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) indicates positive momentum, and the MACD (moving average convergence and divergence) is undergoing a bullish centerline crossover.

On the upside, Rs 1100 is a significant psychological level. A breach of this level could propel the stock to Rs 1180 or higher in the near-short term. Conversely, on the downside, Rs 1000 is identified as a major support level that is likely to provide a strong cushion during any corrective moves.


Breaking through a multi-year resistance, the security closed above Rs 600 levels and subsequently retested the breakout level before initiating a new upward move toward Rs 800. On the weekly timeframe, a flag formation breakout accompanied by significant volume has been observed. The stock has consistently found support at the 9 and 20-DMA levels and established a pattern of higher highs and higher lows.

On the positive side, Rs 800 represents a crucial psychological level. A breach of this level could propel the stock to Rs 880 or higher in the near term. Conversely, on the downside, Rs. 750 is recognized as a major support level, expected to provide a robust cushion during any corrective moves.

Momentum indicators reveal positive momentum, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) signaling strength and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) undergoing a bullish centerline crossover.


The counter is in a long consolidation range, and it has also formed a double bottom formation. A breakout of an inverse head and shoulder formation occurred above 1350 levels. The structure of the counter is very impressive, as it is trading above all its important moving averages.

The momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) indicates positive momentum, and the MACD (moving average convergence and divergence) is undergoing a bullish centerline crossover.

On the upper side, Rs 1400 is an immediate resistance; above this, we can expect a big move till 1500+ in the shorter time frame, while on the downside, Rs 1250 is the demand zone for any correction."

Velumani, who had sold his stake in Thyrocare in 2021, provided the loan to Appu Hotels for a term of two years at a coupon of 17%, the people cited earlier told ET. The loan was given by iHeart Properties, a company owned by Velumani.

Appu Hotels' promoter Palani Periaswamy raised the ₹420-crore debt to regain control of the five-star properties from lenders under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.

The loan will be used to settle ₹340-crore worth of claims of secured creditors and ₹49-crore worth of claims of unsecured creditors of Appu Hotels, which is undergoing a corporate resolution process.

On December 21, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had approved a ₹595-crore settlement plan given by Periaswamy since all lenders to Appu Hotels had unanimously approved it. It rejected a ₹423-crore resolution plan of MK Rajagopal, the founder of MGM Healthcare.

Periaswamy, the winning bidder, settled the loan with the lenders within two days of NCLT pronouncing the order, one of the lenders told ET.

The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) has developed a gap-analyser tool that will help it do a one-on-one mapping of the skill training centres around key infrastructure projects and identify the indicative need for skilling, a senior government official told ET. Data from the Gati Shakti portal will help in doing the mapping.

""The PM Shakti portal consists of different data layers of multiple ministries and by using these layers, MSDE can perform one-to-one mapping of existing skill training centres around the key infrastructure projects and identify the skill gaps,"" the official added.

The idea is to identify areas having large employment potential, such as industry parks and clusters or logistics parks, establishing new training centres there based on demand, and identifying and upgrading existing centres with new courses. The is of the view that the presence of a major infrastructure in an area portrays the key economic activities of that area and its skilling needs. The tool will help the ministry generate an availability or non-availability report for training centres under its various schemes. It will use multiple variables such as the type of a scheme, distance range and course sectors for varying needs and based on this will chart out its future expansion and upgrade strategy, the official said. The skills ministry, set up in 2015 to spread the government's flagship Skill India Mission, is responsible for the coordination of all skill development efforts across the country and runs skill training under various schemes, primarily the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY)."

Investors poured money into stocks to grab a share of India’s economic resilience while companies rushed to market to raise record amounts, and corporates gingerly started to invest again. Banks are in the pink of health, and government finances are robust, though remains a worry.

ET asked a galaxy of experts to make one prediction each for 2024, the early part of which will be dominated by the general elections. But it’s also a year when the Indian economy is set to cross the $4 trillion mark. Not too surprisingly, in our 24 Predictions For 2024, the most dominant theme was the impact of Artificial Intelligence on businesses and lives, but India’s economic potential figured as strongly.

, chairman, , said reforms have fired up risk appetite. ""I believe in 2024, all engines of the - Centre, states, corporates, households - will start to fire. The newly appointed chairman of the 16th Finance Commission, Professor , made a bold forecast on reforms. ""I would go out on a limb and predict that 2024 will turn out to be the year in which India introduces reforms that will propel it into a growth trajectory exceeding 8%,"" he said. ""With the opinion already overwhelmingly in favour of a massive BJP victory, a similar prediction would amount to nothing more than stating the obvious.""

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/india-runs-trade-deficit-with-9/10-top-partners/articleshow/106429244.cms,"New Delhi: India recorded a trade deficit with nine of its top ten trade partners in the first seven months of 2023-24, with the US being the only country with which exports exceeded imports.

India's trade surplus with the US - its largest trading partner - was $19.59 billion in the April-October period, show data from the commerce and industry ministry. However, with China, the second largest partner, the deficit was a whopping $51.11 billion, followed by a $33.56 billion gap with Russia, the fourth largest trade partner of India. The deficit with the third largest trade partner, the UAE, was $6.83 billion.

""With Russia, the imports are of petrol, high calorific value coal, coke and briquettes, and fertiliser, especially potash. Our exports of gems and jewellery to Hong Kong and the US have declined,"" said an official. With Hong Kong, the trade gap was $7.59 billion.

For the period of FY24, India's total merchandise exports contracted 6.51% to $278.8 billion, while imports fell 8.67% to $445.15 billion, according to data released in December.


A trade deficit was recorded with Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Iraq, Singapore and South Korea as well in the April-October period.

""With Indonesia, the trade deficit is because of edible oil. It was getting normalised because of rice and sugar exports to them but now those are restricted and the deficit has increased,"" the official said, adding that India has traditionally had a deficit with Korea despite the two inking a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement in 2009.

As per another official, Iran has reduced its tea and rice imports from India because of foreign exchange issues and finalisation of the rupee-payment mechanism.

""While we have seen similar situations earlier also, the global trade environment is uncertain because of geopolitical issues and a general slowdown across developed economies. Our exports and trade balance are getting impacted by that,"" said Ajay Sahai, director general of the Federation of Indian Organisations (FIEO).

The FIEO has suggested to the government that an aggressive marketing strategy with a focus on vehicles, jewellery, electronic items, auto components, marine products, apparel, insecticides, iron and steel can help Indian businesses tap $112 billion more in export potential in ten countries including the US and UK in three years.

It said owing to global slowdown, rising and high inflation, demand has taken a hit affecting India's exports. As per trade experts, even reviews of the existing free trade agreements are unlikely to give a boost to India's exports.

""Why will the FTA partners agree for a review when they are benefiting from the pact? The reviews can't help plug the deficit,"" said a Delhi-based trade expert."

Sensex and Nifty have delivered high teen returns in the year 2023, which was marked by monetary tightening and high inflation.

Given the robust rally this year, analysts see some areas of concern, which investors have to be careful about. Several IPOs getting heavily oversubscribed is an indication of exuberance. There is frenzy in the mid and smallcap segments where valuations are excessive, they said.

""Investors should give priority to high-quality bluechips which are doing well and have good earnings visibility. A correction in the broader market is inevitable,"" said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.

""We foresee a potential 20% decline in the Indian market before the end of CY 2024. Hence, our recommendation is for investors to book profits on every rise,"" said Amit Goel, Co-Founder and Chief Global Strategist at Pace 360.

However, they are advising swing traders to lock in profits on their long positions at higher levels. Technical analysts have identified the immediate support for the Nifty at around 21,500. Analysts recommend stocks such as Divis Labs, KRBL, Samvardhana Motherson, Gujarat State Petronet, and BBTC.

SAMEET CHAVAN
HEAD RESEARCH, TECHNICAL & DERIVATIVES, ANGEL ONE


While maintaining a bullish outlook in the absence of weakness, it is advised that you don’t adopt an aggressive stance. Instead, booking profits at higher levels is recommended. Any market dip should be viewed as a buying opportunity unless there are clear indications of a major price correction. Immediate support is observed around 21,600, followed by 21,500, while strong support lies around the week’s low around the 21,300 mark. Although prices are in uncharted territory with no prominent resistance visible, 21,850 followed by 22,000 presents an immediate hurdle, considering the overbought conditions.


We like KRBL for the coming week. With Friday’s strong upsurge above Rs 370, the short-term bottom is confirmed now. If we look at the volume activity, it has risen substantially, providing credence to the move. We recommend buying for a target of Rs 398. Traders can participate by following strict stop loss at Rs 363. Gujarat State Petronet also looks a bit promising. During Thursday’s session, the stock prices broke out from the stiff resistance zone of Rs 300-302 with some authority. Notably, robust volumes back the move, and now, if we see any follow-up move in prices along with consistently higher volumes, we expect the stock to unfold a strong rally in the near term. It can be bought for a target of Rs 330. The stop loss needs to be placed at Rs 293.


AVP , TECHNICAL RESEARCH, ANAND RATHI SHARES & STOCK BROKERS


At this juncture, there are no signs of exhaustion on the price chart as well as momentum oscillators apart from a negative divergence in daily RSI. However, the long-short ratio of FPI’s index future is now hovering near 70%. In the past 2–3 years, we have witnessed a temporary top in the markets when this ratio reaches the zone of 70% to 75%. This indicates that there can still be some room on the upside for Nifty, but this could be the last leg of the rally, and then we might witness some heavy profit-booking in the markets. On the levels front, 22,000 can be the next psychological hurdle, followed by 22,400. This can be the red flag zone in terms of the beginning of a corrective move. On the downside, immediate support is placed at 21,400, but 21,000 seems to be a crucial support.


Traders are advised to stay light from here on with regard to long positions. In the case of individual stock opportunities, strict stop losses should be followed on the downside, especially in small and midcaps. Most of the heavyweight pharma stocks participated in the recent rally, but Divi’s Labs was consolidating for many weeks. Finally, the stock has now confirmed a breakout that resembles an inverse head and shoulder pattern. Traders can buy the stock in the range of Rs 3,900-Rs 3,850 with a stop loss of Rs 3,550 on a closing basis for an upside target of Rs 4,363-4,525 in 1-3 months.

Nifty ended the December month at all-time highs and has entered January on an optimistic note. The RSI readings are overbought in Nifty, but generally, markets tend to move higher even in the overbought zone when the trend is very strong. FPIs mainly led the rally in the December series as they started that series with a ‘Long Short Ratio’ of just 36% and had enough room for fresh long formations. However, they are starting the January series with 70% long positions, and if we look at historical data, their positions are seen as overbought when this ratio reaches 70-75%. This ratio was around 70% during the July ‘23 peak, 75% around the December ‘22 peak and 75% during April ’22 peak. Hence, although the trend remains positive, the technical readings are overbought, and the derivatives data, too is approaching the peak zone.


In a strong trended phase, its better to stay with the trend until any reversal sign is seen. The retracement theory indicates a possible rally towards 21,970 followed by a 22,150-22,200 range. Swing traders are advised to book profits on long positions at higher levels. The immediate support for the Nifty is placed around 21,550-21,450 range. One can look for trading opportunities in Samvardhana Motherson, Divis Labs and BBTC in the coming week, where price volume action seems bullish."

long term CAGR is also higher. Extrapolating this trend for future is simple and tempting but is likely to be erroneous in my opinion.

While small can be beautiful in some cases, generalising this overlooks the interplay between industry characteristics, growth potential, valuations and prospective returns.

Size of a business is typically a function of industry it operates in while growth is a function of the maturity of the industry.

At one end, there are small/ midcaps in small and mature/ slower growing industries as there are small /
midcaps in small and evolving / faster growing industries. At the other end, there are largecaps in large and mature / slower growing industries as there are largecaps in large and evolving / faster growing industries.

Complicating this further is the vastly different valuations that stocks trade at – this may at times lead to higher returns from slower growing businesses and vice versa.

As Einstein suggested, “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler”.

Instead of focussing on size, focussing on businesses that enjoy competitive advantages and their valuations has merit.

Avoiding weak businesses lowers the risk of permanent loss of capital and avoiding excessive valuations lowers the risk of poor long-term returns.

Data show that large and small caps have alternating periods of outperformance.

Small caps have significantly outperformed large caps over the past 3.5 years. But ignoring largecaps at this juncture may not be justified. It is useful to remember what John C bogle said, “Mean reversion is the
iron rule of markets”.

""We expect a pickup in corporate capex when the Union budget is presented after the general elections,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ratings firm Icra.

Signs of a recovery in were visible in the GDP data for the second quarter, released in November. Gross fixed capital formation, a proxy for investment, rose in double digits in July-September, also outpacing consumption growth for the fourth straight quarter.



""After 9.6% growth in FY23, real investments increased by 9.9% YoY in the second quarter of FY24, more than double the growth of 4.3% YoY in real consumption (private+government),"" economists from Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a report.

According to private surveys by industry bodies, including the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, most sectors over the past few months have recorded an 80-90% capacity utilisation, seen as a trigger point for initiating investments.

The median estimate in an ET poll of economists conducted last month was for economic growth of 6.3% in fiscal 2025, with inflation slowing to 4.7% - closer to the Reserve Bank of India's target of 4% - that could lead to a cut in the policy rate to spur the economy.

The International Monetary Fund, in its latest report, pointed out that gross investment as a percentage of GDP is expected to rise to 31.9% in FY25, from 31.7% in FY24.

Economists maintain that a few sectors, driven by infrastructure and government spending, will lead the likely pickup in private investment. ""May see a pickup in infra sectors of cement, steel and some production-linked incentive sectors, where production is expected to take off next year,"" said Rahul Bajoria, managing director and head of EM Asia (ex-China) economics at Barclays.

Over the medium term, they expect a host of other sectors also to witness a rise in private investment."

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/invest/why-you-shouldnt-over-diversify-your-investment-portfolio/articleshow/106394216.cms,"Priya is a committed investor, who has put together a diverse pool of investments over time. She is confident about her product selection, having mitigated risk by spreading her investments across numerous products, with small amounts. Despite her strategic approach, Priya realises that her portfolio isn’t delivering substantial returns and lacks protection from market volatility. Additionally, accessing funds when needed proves challenging, and managing the portfolio becomes a time-consuming task. Priya is left wondering where she has gone wrong and how to realign her investments.

Priya’s portfolio exhibits signs of over-diversification, a condition characterised by numerous, small, fragmented holdings that reduce the impact of successful investing. While Priya diligently assessed the merits of each product before investing, she overlooked aligning the investments with her specific needs and goals. There’s a possibility that certain products are not suited to her investment goals, or that she has excessive concentration in a particular type of investment, elevating the portfolio risk.

To remedy this situation, Priya needs to review her portfolio to cater to her unique requirements. First, she must determine the allocation to various asset classes based on her return expectations, risk tolerance, investment horizon, and goals. Next, she should categorise her investments into these asset classes, eliminating those that don’t align with her plan. Priya may need to make additional investments in underexposed assets and divest the overexposed ones, achieving the desired portfolio allocation. Lastly, consolidating her holdings in a few core investments that consistently perform well, is crucial.

The consolidation process prompts a re-evaluation of the rationale for each investment, ensuring these still align with Priya’s current needs. Investments lacking relevance should be earmarked for an exit. Priya should identify and sell investments with narrow mandates, high costs and inconsistent performance, minimising charges and taxes on realised value. On completing this recalibration exercise, Priya would have streamlined investments tailored to meet her goals. This compact portfolio would simplify monitoring, ensuring it stays on track and aligns with her expectations.

My daughter wants to leave her claim in favour of her brother. How can we do this? — M. Khandelwal
To lawfully transfer the rights of a legal heir in an inherited property to another legal heir, two methods can be employed: executing a relinquishment or release deed, or opting for a deed of gift. Your daughter can choose either of the two to give up her claim to the property.

Q.I I bought a house jointly with my parents, for which I took a home loan amounting to 45% of the property value. I have completed the debt repayment. The remaining 55% was paid by my father as down payment from his retirement money. Thereafter, I applied for a home extension loan for 20 years, of which 10 years are remaining. I stay in this extension along with my husband and mother. My father died without leaving a will. I have a younger brother, who didn’t contribute to the loans or maintenance to my parents. What rights does he have in this house? My brother is also going through marital problems, is currently jobless, and may try to force his way into our parents’ house. What rights will my brother have in this property? Can he ask for his full share, and will the loans paid by me count in any way? Can his wife demand a share in the house or sales proceeds if it is sold in the future? Can I hold sole property rights with my mother? — S. Sharma
As mentioned in the query, the father has paid for 55% of the property value for acquiring it from his income or savings. Since he died without leaving a will and without making you the beneficiary of his share in the property, your mother, you and your brother will have an equal right in his 55% share as all of you are class I legal heirs. In your share of 45% of the property value, your brother will not have any right. The loan paid by you is for your share of the property, in which your brother has no right. Your brother’s wife can claim a share only after the demise of your brother and, that too, to the extent of your brother’s share in the property.

Q.My two brothers and I jointly own a leasehold plot of land in Chhattisgarh. This plot houses a double-storied, century-old structure that has been occupied by our cousins for about 50 years now. As leaseholders, we are interested in exploring the possibility of donating this property to our cousins. How can we do this? —A. Gowardhan
You can gift the leasehold plot to your cousins, subject to the right to gift provided in the lease deed that was executed initially. You should also consider taxability in the hands of recipients as per the provisions of Section 56(2)(x) of the Income-tax Act, 1961.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/save/a-personal-finance-problem-for-the-household-why-family-and-finances-need-to-be-delinked/articleshow/106394519.cms,"When I met the 83-year-old lady, she frequently referred to her generous pension. Her children were doing well and she was taking turns to live with her two sons, flying between two cities every six months. She said she could afford the tickets easily and carry gifts that she ordered online. “It is easy for me, but I am so bored,” she complained.

“Why would you not stay at a facility for elders,” I asked. She was absolutely shocked. “Why should I? My sons take good care of me and I don’t have to live like an orphan,” she argued. “Won’t you get the company of many others like you, with conversations, friendships and many new activities to pursue independently,” I asked. She told me she disliked the idea of living independently like that. Her son later told me that the ‘generous pension’ wouldn’t be enough for her to do that. “Let her live with us and feel rich,” he said.

As I was returning home, the denial about financial independence struck me. There are so many situations in which it is easier to live in a household and feel rich, instead of living independently and facing the realities of how far one’s income would actually go. I recall long lines outside the STD booths in our postgraduate days in the early 1980s. While we waited in line to make calls to our parents, we all heard various versions of pleas for more money to spend. Whatever was sent as a fixed allowance was seldom enough; not if one more movie or eating out had to be accommodated. Asking for a subsidy was normal for most of us; that was the mindset. Then and, perhaps, now too.

In India, grown-up children live with their parents, especially if they are unmarried or working in the same city as the parents, or both. No one discusses the possibility that the young may not be earning enough to be living independently. When my friend’s daughter moved to a PG accommodation within the city, she seemed fine with her smallish bedroom and its tiny balcony. However, my friend was torn between guilt and anger that their fancy three-bedroom apartment was scorned by the youngster. We approve dependence and its consequences for most part.

We attach a string of emotions and virtuosity to what should be normal and everyday financial decisions. Living within one’s means should be a goal grown-ups of all ages should be encouraged to pursue. Instead, we celebrate all forms of subsidies from the family, and have a variety of outcomes, including entitlement and resentment. When this privileged and protected young child grows up, keeping the elderly parent at home with him is a normal expectation. We mix gratitude, virtue, duty, obligation, love, care and such emotions to a heady cocktail of denial, conflict and resentment. We also insist that it is not about money. Maybe we refuse to see it as a personal finance problem for the household.

My cousin resents the fact that her son and daughter-in-law do not contribute enough to the household’s finances. They offer a fixed sum monthly, while the parents run the household. The schoolgoing grandchildren are taken care of by my cousin and her husband. Family outings sometimes involve the elders, but mostly don’t. My cousin resents the delivery packets that her son won’t let her touch.

“Why don’t you encourage them to move out,” I ask. “They can’t afford it,” she says, with a mix of love, guilt and regret I can’t fully comprehend.

Household finances are strained by care-giving, whether we accept it or not. The problem is that we find it very difficult to draw the line. We are also culturally so attuned to living together and caring for one another that the difficulties in doing so are accepted and borne as graciously as possible. Not everything can be measured with money, we argue. My cousin would be insulted and shocked if her son paid her babysitting fee. She would rather suffer and endure. Nor can the 83-year-old elder pay her wealthy son a fixed amount every month for her upkeep while she stays with him.

We may not have reached the breaking point, but we know that, wherever possible, financial independence and separation of households into independent entities is happening widely. Married couples routinely live by themselves; grown-up children are moving out of parental homes after finding a job; the elderly are buying and renting units in retirement homes; and parents refuse to travel abroad to function as unpaid babysitters and housekeepers. It’s just that a large number still suffers the burden they would rather deny than accept and change. Therefore, an honest personal finance evaluation of the burdens of joint living households is mandatory.

What are the options while we deal with the demands on household finances? First, initiate and foster a transparent household financial pooling system, to which every member contributes. There is no need to quibble about whether more household help should be hired, or who ate more fruit, but everyone knows and shares the wages and grocery bills that are part of the common pool. Many apps enable such sharing easily.

Second, keep the identifiable personal expenses outside the common pool. Loans, savings, investments are all paid and funded by one’s own finances, without impacting the household budget. So are personal outings, holidays, clothes, accessories and gadgets.

Third, keep gifting and freebies to the minimum. They are the source of discontent, when one tries to overtly subsidise the other. Respect others in the household and let them enjoy the agency of living their lives as they wish.

If each one of the above basic rules create conflicts and quarrels, the household is ready to split and is artificially held together to subsidise one in favour of the other. If all these are a breeze, the household is either wealthy enough to not care or continues to deny its burdens. Take a moment for a realistic evaluation; it may be worth it.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/plan/achieving-early-financial-freedom-is-simple-but-starting-the-process-is-challenging/articleshow/106394165.cms,"In personal finance, specific problems are always easier to tackle than general ones. If someone asks me to recommend mutual funds to invest for 5-10 years, not only is the answer straightforward, but the process by which the answer is arrived at is almost self-evident. However, bigger, conceptual problems are not simple to reason. For instance, consider a question like, ‘What should my overall financial strategy be?’ The answer needs to incorporate longterm goals, spending habits, income levels, and family situations into a comprehensive plan that evolves with time. While specific investment picks can follow the plug-and-play mode, big picture finances need customisation and frequent reassessment.

Such a question can be paraphrased to, ‘Could you plan my entire life’s finances?’. It’s more a topic for consultation than a question, but people ask it anyway. There’s an even more conceptual question that is coming up increasingly: ‘How can I achieve financial freedom by age X?’. The value of X is generally well short of the usual retirement age. To answer this question, one requires not just financial planning, but a lifestyle overhaul. It involves optimising savings rates, investing aggressively, minimising expenses, and potentially considering non-traditional income sources. It often requires focusing on this one goal to guide all major life decisions.

The concept of ‘financial freedom’ itself is highly personal and subjective, and cannot have a clear, universally accepted definition. Achieving it by a certain age will mean different things to different people based on their personalities, interests, responsibilities and outlook on life. So, in effect, a question about pursuing early financial freedom is as much about understanding someone’s motivations and aspirations, as it is about numbers. The financial plan flows from the life plan, not vice versa.

Many people dream of achieving financial freedom early in life. The routine of working to earn money is a major part of our lives, and breaking free from it represents a significant form of liberation. Financial freedom comes at various levels, with the highest being the ability to live without needing to work for income. Some individuals, such as those with substantial inheritances, may not need to work. However, for most people, reaching this level of financial independence requires a lifetime of work, if it’s achievable.

Still, attaining financial freedom earlier in life through prudent saving and investing is possible. This doesn’t necessarily mean complete independence from work, but can provide a substantial benefit. For those who earn salaries, gaining some level of financial freedom early on has become increasingly important today, compared to a couple of decades ago. Even though India is, in general, much more prosperous than it was about two decades ago, potential professional and financial instability is a lurking fear for a lot more people. Amid various job-related challenges, it is undeniable that individuals who have adequate savings tend to be stress-free. Unfortunately, the proportion of younger salary earners (in their 20s and 30s) who save is quite low. The young generation is almost uniformly dedicated to negative savings. As soon as people start earning, they take on loan EMIs, essentially spending future savings today.

This appears to be the usual crusty advice that older people offer the young, but it is true. Regardless of the job market conditions, early career savings significantly contribute to later happiness. The individuals with enough savings to cover a year or two of expenses, including loan EMIs, generally feel more secure about their career choices. Moreover, financial security empowers them to negotiate better employment terms, as they can afford to take risks.

The reality is that achieving this level of financial security is the closest many will come to financial independence. The concept is simple. The first step is to start saving, and the second is to save sufficiently. However, beginning this process is challenging, especially amid a hyper-persuasive consumer culture that constantly lures you to spend. Still, this is the path to true financial independence for most people.

To lose weight without losing money in a gym membership
You may be bent upon losing weight this year (as you were in the past three years), and you may be sure you won’t stop going to the gym after three weeks (as you did in the past three years), but will you really? Stop lying to yourself. Do not pay the outrageously high gym membership fee this year. Start walking. It will save you money. And guilt.


Do you become tonguetied or are pressured into acquiescence when you are accosted by a well-meaning acquaintance trying to sell insurance plans? This year, learn to mouth the word ‘no’. Do not consider ‘’, ‘’, ‘money back’ traditional life insurance plans, which are not an instrument to invest. They offer , and do not provide adequate insurance. Buy pure protection term life insurance instead, and invest in other options that offer better returns.


If you thought you had surpassed the genius level IQ when you thought of ‘password’ as the password for your online , or your kid’s name and birthday for other accounts, it’s time for a reality check. Think different, do not repeat passwords, keep changing passwords every few months, and do not have the same password for all your accounts. If this is likely to take a toll on your brain power, download a password management app, or note these down in a safe place.


Whether you have been lured into Futures & Options by plain greed, or are feeling particularly bold about your investing skills, or have an urge to become rich overnight, derivative trading is not a good idea. You will invariably end up losing money. A lot of money. So stay away from this risky investing option that’s skewed against retail investors, and opt for mutual funds, a much safer instrument.


If festive discounts and online sales are all it takes to part you and your money, you certainly need this resolve. Buy only what you need. Avail of the price fall only if you have kept tabs on the prices during the non-sale period and know it to be a genuine discount. Put this money to better use by starting an SIP or buying health insurance instead.


If you feel your boss is beginning to suspect the authenticity of your excuses for taking leaves, resolve to make a list of all-new reasons for staying off work this year. Give vent to your creativity and move on from the traditional ‘sick child’, ‘food poisoning’ and ‘car breakdown’ to newer ones like ‘pet emergency’, ‘gas leak in the house’ or ‘took a wrong medicine by mistake’.


If you have not already been deterred by the debacle of finfluencer ‘Baap of Chart’ Nasiruddin Ansari, who was banned and penalised by market regulator Sebi, it may be a good time to stop following finfluencers blindly. Do not apply their half-baked, unprofessional financial tips to experiment with your money. Try approaching a financial planner instead."

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/plan/how-to-make-joint-financial-decisions-as-a-family/articleshow/106394730.cms,"One way to mark the start of a new year is making financial resolutions that can help improve your family’s money journey and achieve desired goals. However, it is not always possible to carry everyone along and adhere to financial decisions in a family. A spending decision that is important for one family member may be seen as wastage by another; the saving schedule may seem acutely stringent to one and inadequate to another; there may be differences over the way to deal with a financial crisis or emergency. All these varied opinions can easily escalate to conflicts that linger over the years. However, if you keep in mind some basic rules while dealing with financial decisions, it will make living and the journey easy for all family members.

The key to taking unanimous financial decisions, whether it is for children’s allowances, personal purchases, gifting ideas or saving for financial goals, is to sit and talk as a family. If the reasons for making an expensive home purchase is not conveyed to all, or a unilateral decision is taken by one parent for the children, it will result in resentment that can create bigger rifts. If there is a financial crisis, say, loss of job or salary cut, the implications must be conveyed to children as well so they can understand why their allowance has been cut. It will also make them feel important and part of a joint endeavour. So discuss the impending joint purchases or saving schedule, explaining the rationale for each decision, and considering the requirements of every member.

If your budgeting requires you to cut down certain expenses or abide by a spending limit, it has to be followed by all members equally. A parent cannot claim adult privilege to make personal purchases, while disallowing children to do the same, or similarly, you cannot allow children exemptions because they are kids. This could create resentment not only against the rule, but also the parent, or it could encourage disrespect for . If a financial decision has to be implemented, it should be followed by all.

Many a times, in the zeal to achieve a certain goal or implement a particular financial decision, the strictness becomes suffocating for all. While it’s good to be disciplined, being too stringent can lead to rebellion against the decision. So it’s best for all members to let off steam occasionally or, better still, make a rule that is not excessively overbearing in the first place. Make a or set achievable spending and saving limits to meet financial goals. Above all, understand whether every member is capable of implementing tough decisions or not.

If you are saving for longterm goals like children’s education, it’s best to automate investments linked to the goal after calculating specific goal values. If you are saving blindly without a figure in mind, you may become miserly or overcautious about spending, constantly admonishing the family over unnecessary expenses. If you know how much needs to be saved every month, the disposable income will be clearly earmarked and not create stress for everyone in the family.

Finally, it’s important to focus on the big picture and ignore minor infractions. Even as you save for your big goals, make minor exceptions. If your spouse wants a b’day gift that’s out of the budget, give it, or if a child wants a toy that is a one-time offer, buy it. They will be more amenable and agreeable to saving and achieving goals if they are happy."

To save for my three-year-old son's higher education, I plan to open a PPF account in his name so that it matures around the time he needs it. To pay off our as quickly as possible, we are investing a chunk of our incomes in stocks and using the profits to pay an extra EMI. Lastly, I want to invest in sovereign gold bonds.




The entertainment industry, like most industries, is quickly changing because of ChatGPTlike generative-AI models. This year, I want to upskill to be better prepared to make use of such tools. I will also actively look for a side hustle to supplement my income.




My financial resolutions center around creating value for others. I want to invest strategically during the anticipated bull run, maximising growth opportunities and optimising returns. I also want to foster financial literacy by empowering individuals to make informed investment choices. These resolutions extend to both personal and potential company endeavours, aligning with a broader mission of responsible and value-driven financial practices.




If interest rates remain high this year, I will save via fixed deposits. So far, all my spending has been done through cash, but this year I plan to get some co-branded credit cards and optimise these for benefits (free flight tickets, movie tickets, etc.) and cashback. Since I am disciplined in my spending, I know that having a lot of credit cards won't affect my spending habits. I will also make it a point to opt for auto-pay so that I never miss a due date.



”
I’m 21 years old and am very low on financial literacy. Whatever little I have learnt has been through social media, but I'm a little apprehensive about following anyone's advice blindly. So, I plan to take a financial literacy course this year. Even though I don't have a lot of money to invest right now, I can start with the little I can spare. When I start working in a couple of years, I will be clear about where to invest instead of figuring it out at that point.




To reduce my fears and anxiety about money, I will interact and be open to discussing money matters with family and close friends. Instead of losing sleep over finances, it is better to seek professional counselling. I will navigate my financial goals after due diligence and learning, or take the advice of a financial planner. I will identify emotional triggers to help cut down on impulsive online shopping. Finally, like most people who overwork and underspend, I will not be hard on myself and buy something whenever I achieve a financial goal.




I want to move away from the traditional equity investments in stocks and mutual funds and explore new avenues. Some of the things I’m considering are buying a vacation property as an investment, collecting high-end watches, and breeding livestock (since my father's hometown is in a rural area). I also want to get rid of all my credit cards, having been lured by the trap of points and privileges in the past, and conduct all my transactions through a debit card."

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/ettech-explainer-nyt-vs-openai-why-news-publishers-are-fighting-big-tech-over-llms/articleshow/106425572.cms,"Last week’s copyright infringement lawsuit by The New York Times ( NYT) against ChatGPT- maker OpenAI has opened another battlefront between big technology companies and news publishers. NYT has questioned the very essence of how large language models (LLMs) – on which tools such as ChatGPT-- are trained. The development could have broader ramifications for news media firms and how they should be valued for helping train language models by the courts. Even as most generative AI companies are dealing with copyright issues post facto, Apple has struck commercial discussions with publishers to sign multi million deals to use licenced content.

We breakdown the two different approaches taken by OpenAI and Apple in dealing with using news content to train LLMs.

What’s the lawsuit about?

NYT’s copyright infringement suit against OpenAI and its largest investor Microsoft contends that millions of articles published by the news organisation were used for training chatbots, alleging it of ""wide-scale copying"". The lawsuit says OpenAI's chatbots are now competing with the media platform as a source of information. It added that Google and Wikipedia, NYT is the biggest dataset scraped from the internet by Common Crawl, a non-profit web crawler, data from which has been used to partly train the GPT3 engines. NYT has claimed that OpenAI’s generative AI tools can “generate output that recites Times content verbatim, closely summarises it, and mimics its expressive style”. It says in the lawsuit that OpenAI’s tools “undermine and damage The Times's relationship with its readers ‘and deprive The Times of subscription, licensing, advertising, and affiliate revenue”. The media company says its paywall was broken thereby directly impacting its business model.

While this is the first such lawsuit by a major news publisher, there have been cases filed by music labels, authors, among others, for alleged copyright violations.

OpenAI versus Apple's strategy

On December 22, NYT reported that Apple has floated multiyear deals worth at least $50 million to license the archives of news articles, and has approached media companies such as Conde Nast, which publishes Vogue and The New Yorker magazines, NBC News, and IAC, which owns People, The Daily Beast and Better Homes and Gardens. While there are still concerns about some of the terms offered by Apple, executives at publishing firms have given a thumbs up to Apple’s approach of seeking permission to use content prior to coming out with its generative AI model – compared to other platforms that are approaching for deals after having already trained their models, NYT reported.

Several organisations including NYT, BBC, CNN, Vox Media and Reuters have already blocked access to OpenAI’s crawler. OpenAI has tied up with German multinational media company Axel Springer, which publishes Business Insider and Politico, for its content to be shared with ChatGPT. Back in July, the Associated Press had signed a similar deal.

What are the details

Generative AI companies use a process called web-scraping to accumulate swathes of data from the internet, which are fed as raw material to their LLMs. These LLMs then compute this data to be able to let chatbots like ChatGPT, Google’s Bard and xAI’s Grok to engage in human-like conversations with users, or generate images and sounds based on prompts.

A lawsuit filed against OpenAI back in June 2023 alleged that the company has scraped over 300 billion words from the internet to train its software. This includes articles, posts, websites, books and personal information allegedly gathered without user consent. NYT has claimed that it had first approached OpenAI and Microsoft back in April raising concerns about use of its material – and even discussed potentially having a commercial agreement and “technological guardrails” around generative AI products. These discussions, the publisher said, did not yield a resolution, following which it filed the lawsuit.

The NYT case, in addition to various other such lawsuits in the US, will look to address this exact question. Lawyers point out that these cases will ultimately test the various copyright laws in various jurisdictions.
“Most copyright laws consider the fair use doctrine while testing whether there is an infringement or not…the aspects of how this doctrine is tested may vary but broadly the idea is that some factors are considered. These include how much of the original material is used, the purpose of the use to ascertain if it is commercial in nature, the value of the copyrighted material and the effect of its use,” a New Delhi-based intellectual property lawyer said.

The issue of copyright infringement comes with various layers. First is the training of LLMs and natural language processing engines that use data scraped from the internet. Secondly, this has further implications on enterprises and developers deploying models such as ChatGPT or Bard for commercial purposes. In November, OpenAI announced what is called the ‘copyright shield’, saying it would protect its enterprise users against copyright suits that may be brought up against them from their use of ChatGPT. OpenAI was not the first company to offer such indemnification. Earlier, Microsoft, Google and Amazon have also announced such shields."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/india-job-scene-sees-early-signs-of-disruption-from-ai/articleshow/106422589.cms,"The Indian workforce is feeling the heat of artificial intelligence taking over their jobs.

Last week, digital payments company Paytm laid off 1,000 employees from its operations, sales and engineering teams due to what it said was “AI-powered automation” aimed at cutting 10-15% employee costs. Globally, tech giant Google is reportedly undertaking a “restructuring” of its 30,000-odd sales team, as its AI-campaign manager eliminates the need for human oversight.

Sportswear brand Nike has said it would slash hundreds of positions globally amid poor sales and expand automation to save $2 billion over the next three years. More than $400 million will reportedly be spent on Nike’s second round of layoffs, restructuring and employee severance.

Experts believe these are early signs of job displacement in 2024, affecting roles that are anticipated to become redundant due to the growing adoption of AI. As per market trends, more than 16 million working employees in India will need reskilling and upskilling due to AI's influence by 2027, HR services firm TeamLease Digital said.

To be sure, some experts said the reskilling will also create millions of new opportunities in sectors such as manufacturing and retail in the next few years.

But for now, there could be some pain.

“The possibility of large AI-induced layoffs in the near term are real,” said Kamal Karanth, cofounder at staffing company Xpheno.

“The past technology breakthroughs were also coupled with economic tailwinds; hence, more tech-enabled jobs were created than lost. However, AI is more transformational technology-wise and has come at a time when two wars are being fought with global ramifications. So, the likelihood of AI-related jobs that will get created may not be enough to dwarf the job losses created by AI's disruption,” he said.

Vijay Sivaram, chief executive at Quess IT Staffing, said although AI innovation has been there for a while, its implications on the workforce are being felt only now because of rapid evolution in generative-AI tools.

“We will continue to see AI replacing certain skills, especially among yesteryear engineers who have not been able to upskill,” Sivaram said.

At a macro level, the IT hiring market is in itself in a slowdown, he said. “The ongoing job displacement is also playing out now due to over-hiring that happened in the 2021-22 pandemic cycle. And, therefore, organisations are looking at thinning their teams through AI automation wherever possible.”

ET had previously reported that the big tech pack of ‘FAAMNG’ companies in India are in a near hiring pause amid the macroeconomic headwinds and global layoffs.

These companies — Facebook (Meta Platforms), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix and Google (Alphabet) — registered a 90% drop in active job postings in India so far in 2023 compared with last year, according to data put together for ET by Xpehno. In fact, the combined current job postings by these companies at 200 is just 2% of what usually is the number in India.

Cumulatively, the top four Indian IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCLTech and Wipro — have cut down their headcount by 37,299 over the past two quarters. This compares to an addition of 81,678 jobs during the first half of fiscal 2023.

Vikram Ahuja, CEO of hiring solutions provider Talent500, said IT support services and routine software development have started to see a change in opportunities. “Organisations have started to explore chatbots and customer support products which will help them drive higher productivity and conversion,” he said.

Conversely, AI has positively impacted sectors such as advanced tech (AI development, machine learning), healthcare (AI-assisted diagnostics) and finance (algorithmic trading, fraud detection), he added.

Munira Loliwala, assistant vice president (strategy and growth), TeamLease Digital, said the need for reskilling 16 million employees will also create more than 4.7 million new opportunities by 2027, across manufacturing, retail, education, finance & insurance. The manufacturing sector alone is expected to add nearly 1 million new tech jobs led by AI.

“Roles in application developers, data analysts and platform owners will be the most sought-after skills … Slightly over 50% of these roles are expected to fall in manufacturing, retail / consumer and healthcare sectors that involve substantial amounts of repetitive work that lends itself to automation. Followed by farming, education and finance,” she said."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/2024-how-the-fintech-industry-will-learn-to-live-a-regulated-life/articleshow/106424728.cms,"Some five or six years ago, when fintechs burst into the financial services industry, they were seen as the disruptors. But 2023 brought most of them into the regulatory fold—whether they were payment gateways, cross-border players or digital lending startups, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) framed rules for all.

Now, as the fintechs enter 2024, they will prepare for life within the regulatory ambit.

“Regulations create entry barriers, narrow down scope for disruption, while it is good for an industry which is maturing, it could be challenging for new folks to enter into the space,” said a founder of a large fintech startup.

Eager wait for payment gateway licences

For Razorpay and Cashfree, Christmas came a week early, as after a year of being under embargo from the RBI, which halted new merchant onboarding, the startups finally managed to restart business.

On December 19, the RBI announced seven new names under the payment aggregator licences--Razorpay, Cashfree, Google India, Paymentz, Enkash, Open Financial and R360Pay.

After months of being under a sharp regulatory scrutiny and multiple back and forth between the companies and the regulator, the new licences came as fresh air for the sector.

Startups had to get board-approved customer onboarding processes and policies in place before they got the final nod.

While this might increase the time taken for merchants to start online payments, it is expected to bring structure and form to the fledgling payments sector.

Now it is a waiting game for the rest of the in-principle licence holders for the final nod from the RBI. Amazon Pay, Paytm, PayU, CCAvenue and Billdesk are among the major ones awaiting the licence.

Opening new opportunities

Bengaluru-based fintech Slice got the biggest opportunity last year after a tough 2022. The company, which raced into the unicorn club in 2021, saw its business model crumble in 2022, when the RBI banned credit flow through prepaid wallets. But in a resurrection of sorts, Slice managed to sneak into the coveted banking space by getting a nod from the RBI to merge with beleaguered lender North East Small Finance Bank.

Some defined the deal as a tough one for the millennial focused fintech, but for Slice founder Rajan Bajaj this is a battle which will change his standing in the industry forever, one way or the other.

Slice appointed a new CEO--senior public sector banker Satish Kumar Kalra. Now, 2024 could be the year which will make or break this startup. Not only will it have to raise fresh funds to capitalise the new merged entity but also get back to business.

New Licences

In an interesting move, the RBI this year opened new licences for cross-border payment players. With India being one of the largest remittance recipients in the world, many startups were looking at this sector as the next big opportunity.

Despite remittance being a crucial industry in terms of foreign exchange and money laundering issues, major players in this space like PayPal wanted light-touch regulations.

Finally, the RBI stepped in with clear guidelines and strong mandates for compliance.

“We are hopeful that once we get the licence, it will add more confidence and accountability to our business model, as well as boost investor interest in the space, which will help us grow,” said Movin Jain, cofounder, Skydo, a Bengaluru-based startup operating in the cross-border remittance space.

Self-regulations as the way forward

Continuing the frenetic pace of activity from the regulator in the last month of the past year, it also issued the draft guidelines for the formation of an SRO (self-regulatory organisation).

For the longest time, industry associations were asking for an SRO framework from the RBI. On December 21, the RBI came out with general SRO guidelines.

“Reserve Bank shall issue separate notification inviting applications for SROs for a category/class of its regulated entities, within the broad contours of the final omnibus framework,” the central bank said.

In a statement issued by Fintech Association for Customer Engagement (FACE), the industry body for fintech lenders welcomed the framework and hoped for closer exchange and engagement between the market and the regulator."

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/bond-forwards-set-to-clear-many-grey-areas-for-banks-insurers/articleshow/106428665.cms,"Mumbai: Bond forwards in sovereign debt, for which the Reserve Bank of India released draft directions last week, will help end a regulatory grey area and let banks and insurers cater to the trillions of rupees worth of retail demand for long-term investment products in a standardised manner.

Introduction of bond forwards, which are derivative contracts between two counterparties to buy and sell a specific security on a future date at a predetermined price, will also bring more depth in the country's bond pricing benchmarks in line with advanced economies.

The said on December 28 that bond forwards would particularly help long-term investors manage cash flows and tackle risk, and invited feedback on the draft directions by January 25. No timeline has been given for the launch of the product.


The RBI's move to introduce bond forwards comes after three years of exceptionally strong demand for long-term government securities from insurance companies.

Trades between insurers - looking to lock in a long-term return - and foreign banks are being largely carried out in the form of a complex derivative called 'forward rate agreement' (FRA). This is not dissimilar to a bond forward, but there are no clear guidelines to regulate the product.

""It (the RBI move) is a very welcome development because it gets the product recognised and it would bring in uniformity in terms of the way the market treats the product on its books. Second, it is a bond forward now, not a bond FRA which was prevalent in the market. To that extent, it now allows for delivery as well as clearing - previously a grey area,"" said Nitin Agarwal, head of trading at ANZ.

Insurers need long-term government bonds, which are risk-free instruments, to hedge their long-term liabilities. What the bond-FRA did, and bond forwards would do going ahead, was providing insurers with a fixed return from a government bond which could be bought by the insurance company at a later date. Foreign banks, meanwhile, were using their own funds to buy bonds on behalf of insurance companies and then hedging that exposure in the market.

With the RBI bringing in bond forwards, banks and insurance companies would have greater confidence to offer the product, and the treatment of it in accounting and balance sheet would become standardised.

Market insiders said the prevailing practice of carrying out bond-FRAs meant banks taking different approaches for the treatment of the bonds, as mandated holdings of high-quality liquid assets or assets eligible for computation of the liquidity coverage ratio. Such differences were sometimes pointed out by the RBI in its audits of banks. ""The foreign bank exposure was fully hedged, and the attractiveness of this product stemmed from the fact that government bonds can be used in repo transactions for funding. If there was a funding risk, then foreign banks would not be able to offer this product and then the retail public, which was getting a guaranteed return of 6.5% or 7% - that would not have been possible,"" a person in the know said."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/revised-standards-bring-in-some-leeway-for-fpis/articleshow/106428604.cms,"Mumbai: 2024 begins on an easier note for several foreign portfolio investors (FPI) betting on India. Among the offshore funds who were put off by the onerous disclosure rules imposed by the Indian capital market regulator, some now have a leeway.

A number of FPIs that are pooled-vehicles from countries like Mauritius, Singapore, and Cayman Islands - though not from the US - will be able to meet the regulatory conditions that would exempt them from the new rules that require funds breaching certain exposure levels to reveal the identities of all its investors down to the last natural persons. According to a revised standard operating procedure (SOP) finalised by fund custodians, and ratified by the Securities Exchange Board of India (), on Friday evening, FPIs can report their global assets under management () - a key information needed to avail the exemption - through 'self-declaration', two persons who have reviewed the new SOP told ET.


This marks a change from the initial SOP which had laid down that the global AUM can be determined only from regulatory filings or from the websites of the fund regulator in the respective country. This was a problem as the data is not available from such filings or website information. However, under the new SOP, the global AUM stated in the website of the regulated investment manager (or the asset management company) of the fund or its trustee will be accepted for verifying whether an FPI qualifies for the stern disclosure exemptions.

The global AUM number assumes significance because a 'regulated' fund whose exposure to an Indian business group and to the Indian equity market is below 25% and 50%, respectively, of its global AUM is spared of the granular disclosure regulations.


Besides keeping the share of India exposure in the global AUM below the threshold levels, the other condition for disclosure exemption is that an FPI must be 'regulated' by its home country regulator. This is a hurdle for FPIs from certain jurisdictions such as the US where the 'fund manager' is regulated but not the 'fund', thanks to the Investment Company Act, 1940 - the US law which requires only funds raising money through public offering to be registered with the US SEC. Funds that mobilise money through the private placement route - as most FPI pooled vehicles do - are not registered with the SEC.

Thus, FPI pooled-vehicles from the US would not be able to avoid the disclosure rules as they can fulfil only one of the two conditions. Even though they can unambiguously state their global AUM, the fund vehicles per se are not 'regulated'. However, FPIs from Mauritius, Singapore and even Cayman (a favourite jurisdiction for many US investors) where the 'funds' are regulated can claim exemption if the exposure to India is below the cut-off percentages of its global AUM.

As against 11,000-odd FPIs registered with SEBI, only a small group of around 5% of them would be impacted by the disclosure regulations which were brought in by SEBI in the wake of the Hindenburg Report accusing the Adani group of stock manipulation and incorrect disclosures among other things."

growth of the Indian economy, and you want the economy to grow at a nonlinear pace, then you will have
at least these three technologies on the cusp of momentous growth.

The first big prediction for the next year is the growth in the space sector. The government has opened the space sector for private participation, ensuring exponential growth in space-tech, in the areas of rockets and satellites. This will essentially form the very basis for India for 6G, which is not just terrestrial communication, but hybrid satellite plus terrestrial communication.

To this end, India requires large number of startups who can make indigenous satellites that will also help find solutions to many societal problems.

Satellite has an economy associated with it, right from weather predictions to a multitude of things
that satellite imaging can do today. We also need rockets, using which one can launch these satellites;
India already has a couple of very good startup companies working in that direction. We need to have rapid launch facilities. And for that to happen, we need a rapid production of rocket engines, etc.

The year 2024 promises to offer an exponential growth in the sector: the journey started in 2023 and
next year, you will see big innovation happening.

The second big thing is, of course, wherein India will see a big growth of large language models specific to different domains, capturing the Indian ecosystem.

We may have large language models for other domains too with Indian content. For instance, BharatGPT helping doctors, BharatGPT helping lawyers and BharatGPT helping engineers and so on.

The third prediction is on the sector. You will see massive growth in medical technology sector with more startups entering the sector in the coming year.

India has the potential to be a hub for med-tech manufacturing and is poised to see AI intervention, cyber-physical systems etc coming up in med-tech that will concentrate on how to make technology orient itself towards large scale access of quality healthcare for the poor.

In all these three, I believe that IIT Madras and the consortium of IITs together will play a big role. We are confident that some of our startups will make a big, positive dent in the space sector."

One of the key improvements is a larger 3.2 kWh battery pack, offering an estimated range of 127 km on a single charge. This replaces the current 2.88 kWh battery, which provides a range of 113 km. Charging time for the new battery is expected to be around 4 hours and 30 minutes for a full charge.

The 2024 Bajaj Chetak is also expected to deliver better performance, with a higher top speed of 73 kmph compared to the current model's 63 kmph. Another significant update is the introduction of a new TFT screen, replacing the current round LCD unit. This advanced display is anticipated to offer features like turn-by-turn navigation, a tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS), remote lock/unlock, Bluetooth connectivity, and more.

Rumors also suggest an increase in the under-seat storage capacity from the existing 18 liters to 21 liters, providing users with more space for their belongings.

That’s the biggest thing the Indian equity markets will be looking towards in 2024. The Indian equity market has been an outperformer and a safe haven in 2023 largely on account of good policies and political stability. That is key. Personally, I am very bullish on India.

But India needs trained manpower to truly leverage its demographic dividend. So I would emphasise skill development centres nationwide.

To truly make the best environment for FDI into the country, we must harmonise Centre-state relations. There should be a cell with representatives from both the Centre and the states to be a one-stop solution provider.

We have seen the blooming of young entrepreneurs on a huge scale. But financing is still a challenge. So ideally, we should have a marketplace or an offline exchange for private market equity.

Among global factors, the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine conflicts have led to uncertainties. Human casualties are rising and geopolitical uncertainties are causing havoc in commodity prices.Nobody wants this flux. Hopefully will see a closure of these conflicts.

Finally, I would say global interest rates need to cool down and the US Federal Reserve will have to
lead the way as it’s clear the worries around hard inflation are largely overstated. At best there could be a soft landing. Plus, it will also be an election year in the US. So there will be a lot of global attention on
two of the world’s largest elections. Finally, as someone passionate about wildlife and nature, 2024 will
be a key year for all of us to make environment and sustainability the centrepiece of global narrative.

The automobile company announced that December 2023 alone saw retail sales of 4,400 units, marking a notable 13 per cent increase from the same month in the previous year.

Th substantial growth in 2023 signifies MG Motor India's fourth consecutive year of positive expansion, underlining its sustained success in the Indian market.

A significant highlight of the report is the notable contribution from electric vehicle (EV) models, accounting for approximately 25 per cent of the company's total sales. This emphasizes the increasing popularity and acceptance of electric vehicles among Indian consumers.

MG Motor India's flagship EV, the ZS, and the Comet have played a pivotal role in this success, collectively achieving sales of around 20,000 units to date. The positive response to these electric models reflects a growing trend toward eco-friendly and sustainable transportation solutions in the country.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/at-third-meeting-of-chief-secretaries-centre-cautions-against-freebies/articleshow/106426297.cms,"The Centre has cautioned all the state chief secretaries against resorting to ""freebies"" and is pushing them to increase capital expenditure instead, ET has gathered.

At the third National Conference of Chief Secretaries held last week in New Delhi, top state government officials were advised to guide the ruling politicians against ""freebies"" . The suggestion from the Centre comes as the country heads into a big election year, sparking another potential round of poll promises. It also comes barely a month after five states went to polls with several that arguably qualify as ""freebies.""

At the conference chaired by Prime Minister , distinctions were made on types of , in special sessions by the and Niti Aayog on ""Rationalisation of schemes"" and ""raising capital expenditure.""

While enabling schemes for girls education and school transport/bicycles were termed acceptable, the likes of free drinking water and electricity were referred to as kind of schemes that ""drain"" the state coffer, and set undesirable and unsustainable precedents.

The central government's distinction, in fact, comes amid an ongoing debate on what exactly constitutes a ""freebie"" - a question that the Supreme Court is also seized of. Even the Election Commission of India has attempted a proposed process whereby political parties would declare the financial rationale of a poll promise. However, political and policy opinion makers continue to be deeply divided on the matter.

Building on the issue of welfare-centric schemes, the Centre also strongly advised the state chief secretaries to focus on raising capital expenditure in respective states to boost overall economic growth which can help address social concerns much better, ET has learnt. It was pointed out how the support from the Centre's 'Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment' -which allows 50-year capex loans - has brought down the interest burden for states and created fiscal space for increasing capex.

The Centre, in fact, has been pushing states to rev up on capital expenditure and keep off ""inefficient subsidies"" right from the first National Chief Secretaries conference in June 2022.

The Union finance ministry had then cited the examples of Sri Lanka and Pakistan where insufficient control over expenditure, rising fiscal deficit and increased borrowing landed them in an economic crisis. It had also listed cases of low capex and high off-budget borrowings across several states and asked them to reduce and replace inefficient subsidies such as free unmetered electricity supply.

The focus of the 'Third Chief Secretaries' conference was facilitating 'Ease of Living' processes across five areas - schooling, drinking water, electricity, health and wellness and land & property. A special focus was also laid on the individual beneficiary schemes termed as 'labharthi' in current political parlance."

Travellers seek the country not only for cultural and heritage tourism but also on offer is a varied portfolio of niche tourism products - river cruises, adventure, medical, wellness, sports, MICE, eco-tourism, film, rural, and religious tourism. For a few years, the sector was marred by the pandemic, but has now made a massive comeback and holds great potential for growth and contribution to the Indian economy.

The travel and hospitality industry in India is a multi-billion diverse sector driven by factors like disposable income and has attracted the attention of global investors. Recently domestic tourism has been extremely buoyant. Indians are traveling across the length and breadth of their vast country for leisure tourism, for events and weddings and to experience spirituality. Government schemes like Swadesh Darshan, PRASAD and promotion campaigns like Dekho Apna Desh have aided the strengthening of domestic tourism in the country. On the other hand, there have been efforts to improve inbound tourism by hosting international events. India’s G20 presidency of 2023, and the Cricket World Cup 2023 among other events have contributed to marketing India globally as a preferred destination for leisure, business, and MICE alike.

The potential of Inbound international travel is huge. It is heavily dependent however on the attractiveness of a destination and how it is perceived by the discerning traveller. This requires a well-curated marketing and promotion plan in target source markets. International travel is becoming more regional and fewer people are going in for long-haul travel. India would therefore do well to promote itself more aggressively in the Asia Pacific region. Incentivising travel could be one way. Several countries are wooing Indian traveller through hassle-free and complimentary visas and similar incentives. To receive its fair share of travellers, India should follow suit and position itself as an attractive destination with better value for money, in comparison to the competing destinations in the eyes of the regional traveller.

The Indian hotel market has significant growth opportunities and is poised to contribute $1,504 billion to the country’s overall GDP by 2047, from $65 billion in 2022, as per a report released recently by the Hotel Association of India. As the industry continues to grow, it becomes imperative for the government to take significant measures to propel its development further and realise the full potential of the Sector.

The Union Budget 2023 provided a significant boost to tourism through its multi-faceted mission mode focusing on building more airports and increasing the budget for railways, roads, waterways, and infrastructure development. Improved last-mile connectivity has uplifted tourism in remote unexplored domestic destinations. It is important that the momentum be maintained in the upcoming Interim budget 2024-2025 by announcing policies that will support the demonstrated resilience of the sector and foster the expansion of hotels to bridge the huge gap between the supply of rooms and their corresponding demand.

Over the years, the industry has been advocating rationalisation of taxes, monitored mechanisms for incentives, and easy availability of finance especially to small and medium-sized enterprises.

A primary concern consistently expressed by the industry over the years has been the restructuring of indirect taxes, particularly the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on hotel tariffs and restaurant services within hotels. The current GST rate of 18% is comparatively higher and should be reduced to a more globally competitive rate of 12%. This rationalization is seen as vital for bolstering the global competitiveness of Indian hotels and attracting an anticipated 100 million foreign tourists. Aligning with benchmarks observed in competing destination countries like Singapore, and Thailand, where hotel taxes range between 5-7%, would be one of the ways to position India as an attractive destination, particularly for inbound travel.

To encourage greater ‘Atmanirbharta’ or local investments, the hospitality sector is looking forward to hotels being accorded the status of an infrastructure industry on the lines of sectors like highways, ports, etc as hotels create key tourism infrastructure of tourist accommodation. Tourism is a state subject and Govt of India is encouraging States to grant hotels the benefits offered to manufacturing industries. The benefits of an industry will allow hotels the advantages of lower utility tariffs, lower property tax, easier access to finance, softer loans, and ease of doing business thus reducing the cost of doing business significantly. This will reduce the gestation period for hotels and make the return on hotel investments more attractive.

In addition to the policy interventions to accord hospitality the status of infrastructure at the Centre and allow hotels the benefits available to Industry at the State level, there are other imperatives that will encourage investments. A key step is improving the ease of doing business by reducing the number of approvals, licenses and classification-related issues required for hotel projects and hotel operations. Hotels are burdened not just with the requirement of a large number of licences but the process of acquiring the same is often tedious and very expensive. Creating a single window for all approvals with a timebound system of granting them will infuse efficiencies and economies for rapid hotel growth and development.
On one hand, Hotels are capital intensive, have long gestation periods, and are burdened with a large component of fixed operational costs. on the other hand, they are people centric. Enhancing the skills of the tourism workforce is crucial for delivering high-quality services and experiences to visitors. Continued government investment in skill development Is critical to the sector’s growth and providing direct and indirect employment opportunities.

Encouraging sustainable practices in the tourism sector is important to preserve the country's natural and cultural heritage. The government should focus on allocating funds to promote eco-friendly accommodations, and tourist sites and introduce incentives for industry players aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This will not only contribute to the long-term preservation of India's tourism assets but also generate positive engagement with conscious travellers. We should not over-promote destinations that kill the potential of the location and harm the environment.

The tourism and hospitality industry is a key contributor to the country’s GDP. The recent government focus on the sector is commendable. It should be supported by policy announcements that are imperative to the industry’s continued, healthy, and sustainable growth. India has stepped into the “Amrit Kaal” on the country’s 75th Independence Day and embarked upon the journey of realising the vision of 2047 for a ‘New India’- A developed nation as it turns 100. The restructuring of the Indian economy through rapid and inclusive growth, better living conditions for all, and infrastructural and technological advancements can be best achieved by unleashing the huge and under-tapped potential of hotels in creating jobs – jobs that are direct and across all skill sets, jobs for the differently abled and for women. The higher multiplier effect of the sector also creates a large number of indirect jobs and the ripple and cascading effect in the economy is significant and cannot be overlooked.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/how-much-of-the-2023-frenzy-is-likely-to-extend-to-2024-s-naren-answers/articleshow/106441200.cms,"S Naren, ED & CIO, ICICI Prudential AMC, says “staying invested in the old money is a very easy thing to do. It is the new money where we are telling people be careful and invest carefully, do not invest only in pure equity, invest in across asset classes because if you invest only in pure equity and you say yes, I am going to invest in smallcap after a three-year 40% CAGR, then the risk is higher. So, invest in all the asset classes, invest in debt also through hybrid strategies and that is what we are telling people. But as far as old money is concerned, let it run.”

2023 was a record year. Smallcap, midcap, largecap, gold, bond market, bitcoin, just about everything gave stellar returns. How much of the 2023 frenzy is likely to extend itself in 2024?
S Naren: It is tough to say. We manage other people's money and the money is collected at various points of time. When we launched NFOs in 2021 and 2022 like flexicap, business cycle, PSU, transportation, housing, many of us used to tell us, are you not launching at an inappropriate time? And it is such a happy feeling to see that each one of the NFO investors are a happy lot these days. But going forward it is very challenging.

So, it is very easy to tell the old investors, you are happy investors, stay invested, but what to do with the new savings and what to do with new money if you want to allocate is a very big challenge for investors. Having seen markets for a long period of time, what we have seen is that worst mistakes are made in big bull markets by investors, by mutual fund distributors, by fund managers whether it is in 1992, 1994, 1999, 2007, etc.

When we went back at ICICI and looked at what was the way to avoid the mistakes, what we found was asset allocation is the only way to reduce the mistakes and that is what we are telling people at this point of time because if you had practiced asset allocation in 2007, the mistakes would have been much lower; if you had practiced asset allocation in 1994, the mistakes would have been much lower and that is the lesson which we have seen in bull market which works very well and today we are clearly in a bull market. If you look at the period from 2020 to 2024. So, that is a simple mantra which seems to have worked in all boom markets and that is what we are recommending to all the people at this point of time.

When you say asset allocation, let us spend some time discussing that. Is it time to let us take say 15-20% money of equities in general or 15-20% money from small and midcaps to largecaps?
S Naren: When we look at the market, I think India has been managed brilliantly macroeconomically. It is a fantastic structural market for the long term. So, if you look at the old money that has been invested, let us say in 2020 and 2021 and we expect the market to go back to where it was in 2020 or 21, it is very unlikely. I think it is more important to look at the history of bull markets, the mistakes which have been made by people who invested the money in 2007 or 1994 or 1999.

Just because 2023 was good, doesn’t mean we have to turn bearish & raise cash in 2024: Hiren Ved
We are much more focussed on the fact that new money should be invested more carefully than taking out old money. So, I think keeping the old money is much more comfortable and you can just stay invested in that because it looks with the way brilliantly macroeconomically India has been managed and India being such a fantastic structural story, markets can correct, I do not think we are going to see 2020 markets or 2021 market levels easily.

So, staying invested in the old money is a very easy thing to do. It is the new money where we are telling people be careful and invest carefully, do not invest only in pure equity, invest in across asset classes because if you invest only in pure equity and you say yes, I am going to invest in smallcap after a three-year 40% CAGR, then the risk is higher. So, invest in all the asset classes, invest in debt also through hybrid strategies and that is what we are telling people. But as far as old money is concerned, let it run. If you had asked people one year back would this return have come? No one would have guessed it, including us. I do not think we expected this kind of return in smallcaps or midcaps one year back and that is the reality.

Should one still do SIPs in small and midcap schemes? It is time to rethink the portfolio and say okay I have had a great year now, how do I preserve capital?
S Naren: Even in Diwali, people asked us this question what should one do and we have been telling people that incrementally you have to invest money in largecaps or flexicaps and there is no case in our opinion to invest in smallcap and midcap. Actually, from Diwali till now, largecaps have done pretty well including mega caps and at that point of time, some of the mega caps had done very badly and suddenly now some of the top two mega caps and all have done very well at this point of time. So, we continue to think of mega caps over smallcaps and midcaps.

Is there a case to do some kind of a systematic withdrawal in smallcaps and midcaps? Maybe. But is it easy to do what one of my colleagues in PMS did in 2018? Take out the money and go in smallcaps? Itis very tough at this point of time because we are in a very structural bull market and it is in a situation where the other emerging markets are completely discredited. So, it is a very tough call to say you take out all your money at this point of time in smallcap and then the market goes up and then you will feel like reinvesting.¸ That is a very tough call, whereas it is much easier to say you do a small systematic withdrawal plan that is certainly possible but not a wholesale withdrawal and that is very difficult for us at this point of time given the fantastic way in which macro has been handled, given the fantastic way in which you see a long-term structural story. So, you have to be careful in investing incremental money but to take out all the old money at one go is a very big challenge at this point of time.

Let us talk about valuations. The ultimate benchmark of future returns is a function of earnings and the current set of valuations. Where do you think right now markets are fairly priced, richly priced and which end of the market is reaching a frenzy level?
S Naren: Where it seems to be fairly priced is clearly mega caps at this point of time, where it seems to be fairly priced is clearly if you ask me is banks at this point of time. These are areas where it seems to be fairly priced at this point of time. If you look at most portfolios, they are underweight the mega caps, they are underweight even the banks at this point of time. People are today underweight banks.

Clearly, I would say where valuations seem to be very high seems to be in most of the smallcaps at this point of time. It will be very surprising for you to hear from us that some of the PSUs look overvalued at this point of time. Three years back when we used to meet some of the PSUs, we used to tell them you are the best managed companies, why are you so cheap and some of the PSU MDs used to tell us you tell us what we should do.

We used to tell them markets always function in cycles, you do not need to do anything, you will find surprisingly at some point of time in future because of the good work that you have done, your stocks will become costlier and even we could not have imagined in the next three years the PSUs have moved from being one of the cheapest segments to the market to a situation where some of the PSUs are today overvalued and it is because of the good work done by some of the PSU managements, the way some of the government has also ensured that the PSUs have worked in the interest of the shareholders but that is a funny thing.

In three years, they have moved from under valuation to selective over valuation in some of the PSUs and that is very interesting because it is due to the good work of the government actually and these are the segments which looked at this point of time as overvalued. Now, one of the lessons we learned from our FMCG experience is that markets can be overvalued for quite some time. We used to think that FMCG overvaluation is there long-long back. Now, they have underperformed significantly but for a long time the over valuation stayed. So, just because we at ICICI believe a sector or a theme is overvalued does not mean that they will correct just because we wanted to underperform, that is what we have learned over a period of time but these are the themes which look overvalued at this point of time.

PSU is a very large basket. It starts from defence, there is railway, there are metal, there are banks and each sector is a different play per se. When you say PSUs are looking expensive, which end are you referring to?
S Naren: Obviously, whether it is in smallcap, midcap or PSUs, it is difficult to say which segment. You can use some conventional metric, you can look at some of the price to book, you can look at some of them on price to earnings, you will know which are the stocks which are overvalued by just looking at the price to earnings and price to book and it is difficult for me to talk on specific stocks because if you look at the implied valuations which are there in some of the stocks, in some of the smallcaps for example, they are all in building a lot of things at this point of time and that is why it is difficult for me to point out individually.

But if you look at the index, clearly we have been much more positive on power within the PSU theme than other areas because we felt that the power generating areas are still more reasonably valued compared to the other areas and we have been more positive on the upstream areas in the PSU theme because these were the two things where the price to earnings was much more reasonable than many of the other PSUs.

But if you look at the price to earnings of many of these things and in some other cases, the price to book in some of the areas they are not being cheap at this point of time but I must compliment the managements in many of these companies and I must compliment the government for actually working and making these much more valued at this point of time."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/israel-embassy-blast-investigators-take-cue-from-previous-attacks/articleshow/106426070.cms,"New Delhi: As the probe into the blast near the Israel Embassy widens, investigators have started looking for clues from two similar incidents in the past: An IED blast in the same locality in 2021 and an attack on an Israeli diplomat in 2012.

The National Investigation Agency probing the 2021 blast case has been unable to make any breakthrough so far. In February 2012, when a diplomat was targeted in Chanakyapuri, similar attempts were made on an Israel embassy staff member in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, and another in Bangkok. In all these cases, the suspects were of Iranian origin. ET recalls the case details of the three attacks in Delhi.



A magnetic explosive device was used for attacking an Israel diplomat in Chanakyapuri on February 13, 2012. The probe into the case revealed the involvement of an Iranian national who was allegedly helped by an Indian journalist named Syed Mohammed Ahmad Kazmi. The journalist was later granted bail by the Supreme Court. The first breakthrough into the case came two days after the attack, when a person of Iranian origin, Sedaghatzadeh Masoud, was detained in Malaysia over suspicious movement along with another Iranian national, Nourouzi Shaya Ali Akbar.

The two men had applied for Indian visas at the Indian embassy in Iran from where the investigators obtained their mobile numbers. The probe, according to investigation agencies, revealed that the two mobile numbers were in touch with an Indian phone number issued in the name of Houshang Afsar Irani, who was in touch with Kazmi. Questioning of Azmi revealed that the plans to attack Israel diplomats started in January 2011 when he went to Tehran, Iran, according to investigators. The attack was allegedly planned as a retaliation to Israel targeting Iranian scientists. The Delhi Police later identified four Iranian nationals as suspects - Houshang Afshar Irani (suspected to be the main bomber), Mohammed Reza Abolghasemi, Seyed Mahdiansadr and Sedaghatzadeh Masoud. Police sent letters rogatory to five countries - Iran, Israel, Thailand, Georgia and Malaysia - seeking details of the accused, but could not trace them so far.



A key lead into the IED blasts in January 2021 was a letter addressed to the then Israel ambassador Ron Malka, warning of revenge killing for Iranian Quds Commander Qassem Soleimani and nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. NIA, which took over the probe, sought information from the public, offering a reward of ₹10 lakh, to help identify the two suspected to be involved in the blast as seen in CCTV footage. The agency also examined several people, but has so far been unable to make any breakthrough.



NIA has underscored striking similarities between the explosion on December 26 and the IED blast on January 29, 2021. Both incidents involved suspects conducting reconnaissance on the locations of CCTV cameras, making their getaway in an auto, and eventually seeking refuge in the Jamia area of the national capital, according to investigators. In both instances, typed letters were discovered at the blast sites, containing threatening language.

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi hopes to equal Jawaharlal Nehru's record of returning to the PMO thrice in a row, the new year is also being seen by many as one of the toughest periods for the Congress in its 138-year journey.

It will also mark 40 years since Congress scaled its electoral peak in 1984 winning a record 414 Lok Sabha seats. With just 48 seats in the Lower House of Parliament now, the party has experienced a steady decline in the last 10 years.

In 2024, as Congress hopes to arrest this slide, it will face multiple challenges, the topmost being finalizing seat-sharing deals with constituents of the anti-BJP INDIA bloc which is yet to make any electoral impact.

The Congress will begin these negotiations on a weak footing, having lost the Hindi heartland states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh to the BJP. The defeats have upset the Congress' calculations as it was hoping to sustain the momentum gained by the victories in Himachal Pradesh in 2022 and in Karnataka in 2023.

The losses are most likely to prove demoralizing for the party cadre just ahead of the 2024 general elections as the Hindi belt states play a major role in determining the outcome. In 2019, the BJP had won 141 seats -- 71 per cent of those contested -- in the Hindi heartland.

A poll analyst feels that the 2024 Lok Sabha polls are significant for the Congress considering that it has lost two general elections badly. It is a ""make or break situation for the party now,"" the analyst said.

The Congress is now in power on its own in just three states -- Himachal Pradesh Karnataka and Telangana. While Himachal Pradesh is the only north Indian state the party now rules it has just four Lok Sabha seats. However, in the southern states, the party appears to be consolidating.

After being virtually wiped off the Hindi belt, the Congress would need to devise new plans to capture voters' imagination. The BJP has pitched ""Modi ki guarantee"" and the PM's ""four castes -- women, youth, poor and farmers"" to counter the Congress' freebies and caste census plans, respectively.

With caste census, sops, and anti-Adani campaign yet to generate any mass appeal, the party has gone back to announce a second edition of Bharat Jodo Yatra by Rahul Gandhi hoping to reconnect with the people.

The hybrid (by bus and by foot) Bharat Nyay Yatra from Manipur to Maharashtra will begin on January 14 and cover 14 states.

It will be flagged off by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge from Imphal and will pass through Nagaland, Assam, Meghalaya, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra, traversing 6,200 km through 85 districts.

The march is being seen as politically significant in the wake of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, which are likely to be held in April-May. The announcement of the polls may coincide with the last leg of the Yatra.

Kharge recently said that when everyone gets united, Prime Minister Narendra Modi would not be able to do anything. ""The more you try to crush us, the more we will rise. We are fighting unitedly to save the country and democracy,"" he had said.

Asserting that it is ready for polls, the Congress held its ""Hain Taiyaar Hum"" mega rally in Nagpur to mark its foundation day. The party has also been holding consultations with state leaders for the past several days on Lok Sabha poll preparedness and is leaving nothing to chance.

Though upbeat about reversing its fortunes, the Congress remains acutely conscious of the challenges ahead.

The first roadblock to successful seat-sharing talks within the INDIA bloc has come from within the party as its Punjab and Delhi units openly warned against any Lok Sabha truck with AAP.

With the internal dynamics unclear, it remains to be seen how Congress, the largest constituent of the INDIA bloc will strengthen the alliance and forge seat-wise understanding between professed rivals -- the TMC and CPI(M) in Bengal; the Left and itself in Kerala, and with the AAP in Punjab and Delhi.

Already the smaller parties of the INDIA alliance are advising the Congress to be prepared to sacrifice more than it is ready to.

Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party has been openly voicing its concerns with what he calls ""Congress' arrogance as evidenced in lack of understanding with the SP in Madhya Pradesh.""

The TMC and AAP have meanwhile thrown a spanner in the wheels of the bloc by proposing Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge as the coalition's PM face knowing well that the grand old party is in favour of collective leadership with rank and file behind Rahul Gandhi as their leader.

With leadership issues, a common minimum agenda and seat sharing yet to be resolved, the INDIA bloc currently looks scattered while the BJP continues to set the narrative, the latest being putting opposition parties in a spot by inviting all their top leaders for the consecration ceremony at the Ram temple in Ayodhya on January 22.

The move has divided the opposition, with Congress undecided on attending the event.

On the other hand, the BJP has launched ""Modi ki guarantee"" as its 2024 poll plank daring the opposition to open its cards on the leadership issue so that the narrative that emerges is ""Modi versus who."" The Congress for its part says it will enter the Lok Sabha polls with the plank ""we not me"", and will project a collective leadership.

Whether the Congress' recipe of a leaderless anti-BJP coalition can match the Modi juggernaut remains to be seen.

In the meantime, the Congress hopes to work on an alternative positive agenda for the 2024 elections and unite secular forces against the BJP.

The party's guiding principle as it enters the new year is contained in its Raipur Plenary Political Resolution which reads, ""Unity of secular and socialist forces will be the hallmark of the future of the Congress party.""

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/new-updates/yeh-fitness-resolution-pura-kyu-nhi-hota-zakir-khans-excuse-go-viral/articleshow/106440272.cms,"Happy New Year 2024: An old video featuring comedian Zakir Khan's unconventional excuse to avoid hitting the gym has become the latest sensation on social media. In a clip from a well-known TV show, Khan humorously declares that he contemplates making a fitness resolution only when it coincides with the first day of the month, the New Year, and, interestingly, Monday. With all three aligning on January 1, we delved into the experiences of individuals who have, at some point, found themselves guilty of neglecting their New Year's fitness resolutions.

As per a Forbes and Sundried survey, a substantial 48 per cent of respondents have identified improving fitness as a top priority for the year 2024. Additionally, a significant 49 per cent plan on leveraging fitness apps to stay committed to their resolutions. However, the survey also brings to light the challenges ahead, as 43 per cent admit to the likelihood of abandoning their fitness goals after just one month, while a mere 10 percen express confidence that their resolutions will endure throughout the year.

In the realm of personal anecdotes, Viraj Ghelani, an actor and content creator, humorously points fingers at his friends as the culprits behind his wavering commitment to workout resolutions. Ghelani remarks, ""My friends are the reason why I don’t stay true to my workout resolution. If they can’t follow it, they don’t let me either. This has been going on for many years now!""



Ashish Chanchlani, a popular content creator, draws an amusing parallel between fitness resolutions and fleeting interests, stating, ""For most people, and the old me, making a resolution to be fit is like buying a toy that you play with for a week at best and then move on to other things.""

However, influencer Sejal Kumar expresses a determination to break the cycle, acknowledging past setbacks but pledging to be consistent with her fitness resolution even if occasional slip-ups occur. On a similar note, actor-comedian Bhuvan Bam shares his strategy for adhering to his resolution, revealing, ""To not break my New Year resolution of working out, I started lifting weights a few months ago to be in a great flow with a stronger will.""

In a unique twist, actor and content creator Sai Godbole bids farewell to the perennial excuse of ""Maybe tomorrow"" for hitting the gym. Godbole, with a passion for sports, embraces a resolution aligned with his interests, exclaiming, ""Every year my resolution of 'I am going to hit the gym' takes a detour to 'Maybe tomorrow.' So, adios to 'Maybe Tomorrow' and bonjour to a sport I actually love to play!""

As the world navigates through the complexities of fitness resolutions, these candid reflections from well-known personalities shed light on the humor and challenges embedded in the pursuit of a healthier lifestyle. Whether it's the comical excuses of Zakir Khan or the sincere resolutions of influencers, the journey towards fitness in the new year promises to be a rollercoaster of laughter, determination, and unexpected detours.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/institutional-investments-in-indian-real-estate-recorded-at-5-4-billion-inching-towards-pre-pandemic-levels/articleshow/106441532.cms,"Institutional investments in the Indian real estate sector maintained a steady momentum at $5.4 billion, rising 10% y-o-y during 2023, with the office segment to be the highest contributor. The year witnessed the highest levels of investment inflows since 2020 showcasing India's resilience despite uncertainties in global markets otherwise.

Office sector continued 56% share in total inflows in 2023, attracting both global as well as domestic capital, led by select large deals. The uptick reflects a rising interest in completed and pre-leased income-yielding office assets, showcasing investors' sustained confidence in the long term potential of the sector.

""As India's real estate sector closes yet another promising year, institutional investments saw an increase of 10% and stands at $5.4 billion—the highest since 2020. The investments in Indian real estate are more broad-based, with significant investments coming into education, shared spaces, and data centers, adding to a strong domestic upcycle in office, residential, and industrial areas,” said Piyush Gupta, Managing Director, Capital Markets & Investment Services at Colliers India.

After witnessing subdued activity in the first 3 quarters, investments in alternatives rebounded in the last quarter, taking the overall inflows in alternatives to $650 million for the year. The segment had a 51% share in total inflows during Q4 2023, indicating strong demand across data centers, student housing, life sciences, schools amongst others.

“Investors from the APAC region have been showing an increasing appetite for Indian real estate, contributing to about half of the total foreign inflows during 2023. Looking ahead to 2024, investment activity is likely to remain unabated backed by robust domestic economic fundamentals, while a strategic integration of technology and ESG will play out in investment decisions."" said Gupta.

The year 2023 saw foreign investments retaining their dominance, forming 67% of the total inflows for the year, domestic investments also registered an impressive 66% annual increase at $1.7 billion. However, the overall investment inflows during the year remained sturdy, the last quarter of the year saw moderation with $0.8 billion investment, a 37% y-o-y drop, as key global investment markets faced downside risks.

Fund inflows from the US have also witnessed a drop in 2023 as compared to 2020 levels while Canada and Singapore are increasingly establishing themselves as leading sources of foreign capital in Indian real estate. These two countries accounted for 78% of the global real estate inflows into India during 2023.

Additionally, the investment inflows from APAC countries have been rising every year and have surged to 3.6X times in 2023, compared to 2020. Investors continue to view India favorably, owing to strong economic performance, improved regulatory framework, and sustained demand across various real estate segments.

“In the ever-evolving tapestry of India's real estate landscape, while investors continue to diversify portfolios, the office sector continues to enjoy significant affinity. Along with envisaged momentum in alternative assets, industrial & warehousing, and residential sectors in the next few quarters, the office sector will continue to dictate India's real estate investment ecosystem.” said Vimal Nadar, Senior Director and Head of Research, Colliers India.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/cheap-chinese-ev-resembling-toyota-land-cruiser-lc300-goes-viral/articleshow/106442321.cms,"A video from China is making rounds on social media, showcasing a vehicle that bears an uncanny resemblance to Toyota's iconic Land Cruiser LC300. The Land Cruiser, known for its premium status and starting price of Rs 2.10 crore ex-showroom in India, has been replicated by a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker. The design similarities are evident in the grille, headlights, fog light housings, and bumper at the front. Even the boxy silhouette, chunky grille, and distinctive taillights pay homage to the Land Cruiser's iconic design.

The Chinese vehicle, initially known as the Kuluze EV, was first spotted in China earlier this year. However, it now adorns the 'LONGQ:EV' badging on its tailgate. Notably, the overall size and wheel size differ from the LC300, resembling those more fitting for a Maruti Suzuki Wagon R.

This Land Cruiser copycat from China has stirred up conversations on social media, highlighting the fine line between homage, inspiration, and outright copying in the world of cars. The exact details of this vehicle remain unknown. It is uncertain whether it will go into production, if it is a one-of-a-kind creation, or if it is merely a regular car disguised to resemble a Land Cruiser by an aftermarket company.

Nevertheless, this model's striking resemblance to the LC300 suggests it could serve as a more affordable alternative to the SUV, incorporating all its design elements in a smaller package. The attention it has garnered on social media reflects the fascination with automotive replicas and raises questions about the ethics and legality surrounding such imitations.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/view-more-than-repaint-of-crime-laws/articleshow/106426239.cms,"On December 21, Parliament passed the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023. They replaced the Indian Penal Code, 1860, Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, and Indian Evidence Act, 1872, respectively. The passage of these three laws signals a shift in India's justice system.

While the existing legal framework served the country for a long time, the new laws aim to create a justice system that is more responsive, equitable and aligned to the evolving needs of the nation. These laws are characterised as instruments for 'updating the Indian Justice System', as they recognise the historical limitations in the previous , which were primarily used to consolidate British rule rather than the administration of justice.

Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita is a comprehensive effort to redefine and refocus the penal code. With several sections being amended, repealed or added, the law introduces a nuanced approach to offences, penalising actions that endanger India's sovereignty, unity and integrity. It also addresses contemporary challenges, such as terrorism and organised crime, distinguishing between major and petty offences, and prescribing stringent penalties for the former.

Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita seeks to humanise our criminal justice system.

By introducing measures like electronic registration of FIRs, digital recording of statements and stringent timelines for investigations, the law aims to make justice more accessible and responsive to the needs of the people.

It replaces outdated terminology with more people-friendly language, reflecting a humane approach.

In cases involving heinous offences, the proposed legislation emphasises the necessity of a mandatory visit by the forensic team. This strategic provision aims to bolster the investigative process, ensuring that a specialised team conducts an on- site examination to collect crucial evidence. By mandating such visits, the legislation seeks to enhance the thoroughness and accuracy of criminal investigations, contributing to a more robust legal framework centred around contemporary standards of justice.

Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam In a contemporary legal landscape where technology plays a pivotal role, this law recognises electronic evidence as any information generated or transmitted by any device or system capable of being stored or retrieved. This broad definition encompasses a wide range of digital data, from emails and text messages to multimedia files, acknowledging the diverse forms of evidence relevant to modern cases and emphasising factors such as authenticity and integrity.

This inclusion is crucial to maintaining the credibility of electronic information presented in court, ensuring that technological advancements do not compromise the reliability of legal proceedings. Special provisions for the admissibility of DNA evidence and the acceptance of expert opinions as evidence bolster the Act's commitment to a modern and effective legal framework.

A noteworthy feature of the proposed is establishing an independent director of prosecution in each district. This significant development aims to fortify the prosecution system, ensuring fairness and impartiality at a local level. Similar proactive measures taken in a time-bound manner can prove crucial in strengthening the criminal justice apparatus and fostering public confidence in the legal system.

The three new criminal laws will likely come into force only after a few months. The intervening period will prepare and equip the criminal justice system for a smooth transition. They signal not just a legal transformation but a commitment to ensuring justice that is in tune with the contemporary needs of society.

This legislative stride positions India toward a more equitable, accessible and efficient legal framework. The journey of legal reforms has begun, and these pioneering laws promise a future where justice is not only served but is genuinely inclusive and reflective of the dynamic fabric of our nation.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/india-will-be-the-global-nucleus-of-generative-ai-says-tcs-ceo/articleshow/106426039.cms,"The year gone by will be remembered as the one that Generative AI went mainstream. Nothing demonstrates artificial intelligence’s impact on our public consciousness better than leading dictionary publishers Collins naming the abbreviation of the term — ‘AI’ — as their word of the year. Yet, we are still only at the advent of this technology revolution.

With many rapid developments in GenAI tech, tools and proof of concepts, 2024 is poised to be the year of acceleration. Enterprises across the world are strategising on acquiring new AI-fuelled capabilities to deliver elevated customer experience and process augmentation and to gain competitive edge.

For example, the healthcare industry will see a massive shift from generic treatment to AI-led diagnosis and personalised treatment, from reactive care to predictive care. Retail is another industry where GenAI can transform experiences — from predictive inventory management for retailers to personalised shopping experiences for customers.

Similarly, every industry is set to be lit with a new wave of innovation. The ‘Future of Jobs’ report by the World Economic Forum (TCS is a strategic partner to the WEF), estimates that 12 million more net jobs will be created by AI, than displaced by it, by 2025.

India’s 5 million-strong IT industry workforce, once retrained and reskilled, has the opportunity to be at the very epicentre of this global opportunity for economic growth and job creation. At Tata Consultancy Services, we see this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for societal and marketplace reimagination. Our newly formed AI.

Cloud Business Unit is actively involved in consulting and advising our customers in India and worldwide on AI-led transformation.

The interconnected ecosystem of emerging technologies has the potential to revolutionise smart cities, transportation systems, supply chains and energy grids, fostering a more sustainable and efficient world. While we have barely scratched the surface, it is an exciting time to be in the technology sectors.

The opportunities are unprecedented in every direction. India will be at the epicentre of the GenAI revolution by building AI-infused solutions in India, for India and the world. Guided by the ethos of the Tata Group, TCS will continue our mission of nation-building and strive to be at the forefront of this technology-led value creation opportunity.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/tech/predictions-for-2024-rapid-growth-in-digital-infrastructure-and-tech-on-cards/articleshow/106426158.cms,"By 2024, India is poised to witness a significant leap in its digital infrastructure and technology sector. This prediction is supported by several key factors, including government initiatives, increased foreign investment, a burgeoning startup ecosystem, and a growing talent pool in the technology sector.

Firstly, the Indian government has been actively promoting digitalization across various sectors. Initiatives like Digital India, which aims to ensure government services are available to citizens electronically, have already laid a strong foundation. By 2024, these efforts are likely to have matured, resulting in more streamlined, efficient, and accessible public services, thus promoting broader digital adoption across the country.

Secondly, India has become a hotbed for foreign investment in the technology sector. Companies like Google and Facebook have already made significant investments in Indian tech startups. This trend is expected to continue, fueling innovation and technological advancement. The influx of capital not only boosts the tech industry but also encourages a culture of entrepreneurship and innovation.

The startup ecosystem in India is another critical element. With cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad emerging as startup hubs, there is an increasing number of tech startups focusing on AI, machine learning, and other cutting edge technologies.

By 2024, some of these startups are likely to have evolved into major players, contributing to India’s stature as a global technology leader. Lastly, India’s talent pool plays a crucial role.

With one of the largest populations of young people in the world and a strong focus on STEM education, the country is producing tech-savvy professionals ready to contribute to and drive the digital revolution. Moreover, initiatives to upskill the workforce in areas like AI, data analytics, and cybersecurity will further strengthen this talent pool.

In summary, given these dynamics, it’s reasonable to anticipate that by 2024, India will have made substantial strides in digital infrastructure and technology, significantly impacting its economy and global standing in the tech world.

With international journeys poised to triple by 2030, strong domestic demand and new airports coming up, India is becoming a travel powerhouse.

Air India is preparing to meet this demand head-on. Our 470-aircraft order is now leading to the arrival of one new aircraft every six days throughout 2024, unlocking opportunities.

By March 2024, nearly one-third of Air India’s widebody fleet will feature world-class cabin products, including Airbus A350s that represent the best of global aviation.

Then, from mid-2024, the remainder of our widebody fleet will start undergoing complete refurbishment to bring all aircraft up to the same world-class level by the end of 2025.

Travellers’ growing affluence is driving preference for non-stop flights and higher demand for additional comforts, featured in our new and refurbished aircraft. Plans include a makeover of Air India’s new website and app and the industry’s first generative AI chatbot, extending into new operational systems that will strengthen our foundations.

Likewise, world-leading experts have been engaged to revamp airport lounges and our loyalty programme, while a new 24/7 customer centre will offer support in nine Indian and foreign languages.

More than 9,000 new Air Indians have joined their experienced colleagues who, together, are determined to build an airline group second to none, be it full-service Air India or the value-based connector Air India Express that will double in size during 2024. And then there are our colleagues at Vistara who, regulatory approvals permitting, will join the larger Air India mission during the year.

It’s been two years since privatisation, and there is much we have yet to do, but change is already afoot. For this isn’t just an airline, it’s a fulfiller of aspirations, an ambassador for the nation, and a warm welcome home for Indians everywhere. 2024 promises to be an exciting year as Air India continues on this mission to soar, once again.

Initially, the positive sentiment was aided by strong affordability as interest rates were at all-time lows in 2020 and 2021 and as property prices had remained flat through the eight-year down cycle from 2013 to 2020. In the post-pandemic era, the customer focus remains on evolving lifestyle preferences, and a desire for multifunctional and sustainable living spaces which have resulted in strong home sales across mid-premium, premium and high-end residential projects in India.

Modern buyers are willing to invest in quality residential developments that support their lifestyle. Consolidation in the residential real estate sector has only accelerated over the last few years amid regulatory changes like demonetisation, GST, and RERA as well as the NBFC liquidity crisis leading to supply-side issues for many developers. This has resulted in customers gravitating towards branded organised players.

Favourable macroeconomic indicators, including India’s GDP growth being the highest in the world, rapid urbanisation, and rising per-capita disposable incomes, make us very optimistic about the long-term prospects of the real estate sector in India.

We see demand sustaining in the residential market in 2024, and at least over the next three-five years, as the sector is still in the early stages of an upcycle.

Product proposition and quality will drive real estate in India, giving an edge to large, reputed developers with strong operational capabilities and healthy project pipelines. We remain bullish from a demand perspective with a lot of headroom for growth over the next few years. However, a robust governance structure is essential for the successful integration of sustainability and quality within organisations and requires committed leadership, direction and stakeholder engagement across the sector.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/smart-fencing-of-300-km-along-myanmar-border-to-begin-soon/articleshow/106494081.cms,"Amid ongoing ethnic clashes and illegal migration of Chin-Kuki nationals from Myanmar, the Centre is set to issue orders for smart fencing for an additional 300 kilometres out of the 1,643 km of India-Myanmar border, running along Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram, said a senior government official. The fencing of the remaining length of the border is likely to be completed in the next four and half years, the official said.

The development comes after the initial pilot project of 10 km was completed last year and work for another 80 km was awarded, taking the total smart fencing to 390 km.

The porous border along the India-Myanmar has witnessed large-scale smuggling of goods, drugs, arms and ammunition. Following the clashes in Manipur in May 2023, the Centre embarked on a project to examine ways to fence the border which has been completed by multiple agencies. Once the smart fencing is completed, the free movement regime (FMR) along the India-Myanmar border will be discontinued and those trying to come or go on either side will have to obtain visas from the respective countries, said people familiar with the matter.

Under FMR, people belonging to the hill tribes, whether they are citizens of India or Myanmar and are resident of any area within 16 km on either side of the India-Myanmar border, can cross the border on production of a border pass, which is issued by the competent authority with a one-year validity.

""The lack of awareness among locals, ambiguity and uncertainty on FMR has posed major problems, which has further led to fear among border residents that their traditional rights will be unfairly curtailed or they will not be able to communicate with their relatives across the border or access their livestock and cattle,"" a senior Nagaland Police official said on condition of anonymity.

The Mizoram and Manipur governments collected biometrics of illegal migrants last year and, following the exercise, were able to identify more than 37,000 migrants who were put in negative lists for Aadhaar and voters' identity.

However, the number of illegal migrants, whose influx started after the 2021 military coup in Myanmar, could be higher, said officials."

Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva expelled Yadav from the party on disciplinary grounds.

A letter issued by Sachdeva said Yadav had announced appointment of functionaries of the party's state unit, Lok Sabha incharges, and district presidents that was not permitted by the party constitution.

Yadav was being counselled and warned for the past few days for his ""anti-party and anti-social activities"" by the state leadership but he defied it, the letter said.

The appointment of state functionaries of all the eight morchas of the party was to be made by the state leadership and Yadav's order for appointing them fell under the category of indiscipline, it said.

No immediate reaction was available from Yadav on the action taken against him by the Delhi BJP president.

It is a sensation that transcends the 'mere' act of reading, encapsulating the essence of time itself.

The almond and vanilla fragrance of aged pages evokes a sense of nostalgia, transporting readers to different eras, cultures and minds that have left their mark on the printed word. Not to mention the years passed and encaptured by the book object itself.

Each book carries the whispers of the hands that have turned its pages, the musings of minds that have read its words. It is a sensory journey that engages not only the intellect but also the olfactory senses, triggering a flood of Proustian memories and emotions.

The unique aroma of old books fosters a sense of intimacy with literature - stories and tellings - creating a sacred space where you become a custodian of a heritage, of a cult that non-book-lovers will forever be denied of. The scent of old books is a ritual, a communion with the collective wisdom of humanity, beyond the grasp of e-hoi polloi and digiterati."

Government agency Nafed launched the pilot of selling subsidised pulses under the Bharat Dal brand through Reliance Retail and Big Basket. It plans to soon begin sale of Bharat Atta through the private retail channels, confirmed Nafed officials, who did not wish to be identified.

Reliance has started selling Bharat Dal from end-October and has been getting increasingly good response. At some of the Reliance stores, the sale of Bharat Dal is about 50% of the total sale of chana dal at that store, said industry sources. Although subsidised chana dal is competition to their own private labels, private retailers have agreed to sell Bharat Dal as they get good volumes and because of government pressure, said sources. Reliance did not respond to the email sent by ET.

The availability of Bharat chana dal is more in north and west India where Nafed is getting the Bharat dal processed. Sources told ET that there was not much difference in the quality of Bharat dal and the private label dal as both get chana from Nafed, the only agency in India which has stocks of chana. Bharat chana dal is cheaper than the lowest priced dal sold by these retailers by over 40%.

The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) in a notification amended the import policy for such products from “restricted” earlier to “free subject to…conditions”.

A company can now move used IT assets (laptops, desktops, monitors, printers) from SEZ to DTA without a licence “only” for the purposes of further use in their DTA operations. Till now, a company in DTA needed a licence for imports of these goods from SEZs.

As per the notification, these equipment should have been used in SEZ units for at least two years and should not be older than five years from the date of manufacturing at the time of moving them to DTA.

In cases where a unit is closing down its operations in SEZ and relocating to the DTA, the import of these items is allowed without a licence subject to a condition that those products should not be older than five years from the date of manufacturing, the DGFT said.

The development assumes significance as the government had in October last year introduced a new import management system to monitor shipments of laptops, tablets, and computers into the country.

“Import of any used IT assets which do not fulfil these criteria shall be subject to licence for restricted import,” the DGFT said, adding that these relaxations will be applicable on the condition that no exemption has been availed from any regulatory requirements such as Compulsory Registration Order (CRO), restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS), and WPC (wireless planning and coordination) import licence.

If an SEZ unit has second hand/used/old equipment used for less than two years, they cannot be shifted to DTA."

The FCI has invited bids from banks for raising a three-month tenure loan to likely meet its cash flow mismatch and for the procurement and distribution of food grains, said a person familiar with the matter.

This short-term loan will be on an unsecured basis. Fully owned by the government, FCI has a paid-up capital of Rs 9,999.79 crore.

""The corporation has invited bids and generally, the interest rate for such tenure loans are around 7%,"" said a bank executive aware of the matter.

FCI, in its bids, has sought revolving credit, which essentially means it can avail short-term loans from lenders if their outstanding loan on the date of request is less than the quantum originally offered, irrespective of disbursements and repayments already done.


Since FY22, the government has stopped the practice of FCI borrowing from the , or NSSF.

As per the FY24 Budget, FCI is to borrow Rs 1.05 lakh crore through ""others,"" which the government noted is arrangements through banks to cover temporary cash requirements.

""Banks have the option to offer rates linked to MCLR, Repo, or Treasury bill rates,"" the corporation noted in its bid document.

In FY24, the corporation had approved a short-term loan limit of Rs 75,000 crore. As per the annual report, FCI in 2022-23 availed total short-term loans of Rs 1.18 lakh crore, of which ₹3,000 crore were outstanding as of March 2023.

This is the third tranche of borrowing by FCI in the current financial year. ""This year so far, FCI has borrowed in two tranches, in June and September,"" he said.

""These additional borrowings are largely on account of the extension of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) scheme,"" said another bank official, adding that mostly state-run banks participate in the bidding process. In 2022-23, FCI repaid₹1.28 lakh crore to banks borrowed through this route."

Candidates of political parties will likely accelerate their spending from this quarter (fourth), increasing travel for campaigns and use of publicity material, among other things, thereby pushing up consumption.

""In 2019, it was estimated that ₹60,000 crore was spent, which, when adjusted for inflation, more parties/candidates can touch the ₹1 lakh-crore mark. A lot of this would be in cash and not accounted for,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda.

ET Bureau

General election in India is scheduled for the middle of this year, and economists say rural households and lower-income groups could benefit from the increased spending by political parties.

""We are expecting that pre-election spending, based on historical trends, would lead to an increase in consumption, but the rise would be more for rural consumers and people in the lower-income bracket,"" said Sakshi Gupta, principal economist at HDFC Bank.

Gupta said some of the impact of elections on consumption was visible in the third quarter itself, owing to state elections. The government increased fertiliser spending and announced cuts in LPG prices this year.

Radhika Rao, senior economist at DBS Group Research, said there may be a slight uptick in discretionary consumption, which benefits the lower- and middle-income stratas. ""Growth may receive at best a 0.5 bps uptick in the final quarter due to elections, but even that may be subdued by base effects,"" Rao said. Paras Jasrai, senior analyst at Ind-Ra, said the growth impact may be limited to 0.2 -0.3 percentage points, but pointed out that GDP growth would still remain below 6% in the last quarter of FY24.

The RBI's monetary policy committee has projected growth to ease to 6.5% in the third quarter and to 6% in the last quarter of the current fiscal.

The little ninjas, your friendly-formed feedback forms, a.k.a. feefos - remind us of that line made famous in the 1970s by free-market economist Milton Friedman (there is, indeed, something called a 'free market'), every time we finish a restaurant meal (delivered home or otherwise), a service, an experience - or even six months into a new job. With their checkboxes and rating scales, feefos - now backed by the superpower of AI - wait stealthily for you to finish and then pounce on you before you can even do a quick internal evaluation of product or service.

Feefos may look innocent, but they are not. They can suck you into a black hole of self-doubt and force you into unnecessary overthinking. Should you rate this coffee shop's ambience as a 3 or a 4? Was the relationship manager polite enough and answered all your queries? The tyranny doesn't end with giving honest feedback. There will be follow-up mails, asking you to explain what was wrong, reminders for follow-up visits. While we have all been sweet-talked into filling feefos one time or the other, ever wondered about their afterlife? Perhaps they, too, are sucked into a black hole. Despite the reams of 'quality monitoring' data that companies gather from feefos, the 'overall experience' of too many firms, at best, get one star."

Hollywood couple Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones welcomed the New Year in Hyderabad.

The ‘Fatal Attraction’ star took to Instagram on Monday and shared a video of himself and Jones, sharing a sweet kiss to the beat of AP Dhillon’s ‘With You’. The couple is on a sojourn in India, and the video was taken in Hyderabad.

In the video, Douglas says, “Happy New Year, everybody! Hyderabad, India, have a great, great 2024! Lots of love,” said the ‘Basic Instinct’ star before kissing his wife.

The video has gone viral on the video and picture-sharing platform, gaining more than 29, 302 likes. Along with sharing the video, the actor also wrote, “Happy New Year everybody! Have a great great 2024! Lots of love, M, and C.”

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/sriram-raghavan-reveals-that-merry-christmas-has-a-pinocchio-connection/articleshow/106494024.cms,"New Delhi: Sriram Raghavan says his upcoming thriller 'Merry Christmas', starring Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi, is set in the early '80s and shares a thematic connection with the story of 'Pinocchio'. Raghavan, regarded as the master of the thriller genre in India, returns to direction with the film after 2016's hit 'Andhadhun' and hopes the audiences engage with the story that unfolds within a span of one night. It will hit the screens on January 12.

The trailer of 'Merry Christmas' shows the two central characters walking past a theatre showing the children's classic 'Pinocchio', about the titular wooden puppet whose nose grows longer when he lies.

""We have not specified the time but it is set in the early '80s. 'Pinocchio' has many movie versions so we decided to design our own version of the 'Pinocchio' poster. We haven't shown the movie on screen, you will only hear the soundtrack. So, thematically it's very much like our film because it is about deception. When Pinocchio tells lies, his nose gets longer,"" Raghavan told PTI in an interview.

The filmmaker said it was challenging to cut the trailer of the Hindi film as he wanted to create intrigue about the plot of the movie, which he shot simultaneously in Tamil.

""The Hindi trailer was more fun because it's got these quick cuts. The whole aim was to not give away the story and make viewers think of their own stories so that when they come to the cinema hall, they're surprised. Occasionally, one of them will be right too,"" he said.

The Hindi trailer of 'Merry Christmas' seems like a time capsule, taking viewers back to the era of weighing machines, landline phones and single-screen theatres.

Raghavan, 60, said he decided to include these elements as they are all gone now.

""These are iconic things of that era and it has all gone now. I remember I would go to the railway station just to check my weight and get that little card, which had a picture and something written on it. I used to collect those. This is why we chose it for our film.""

The idea to set the film within the span of a night was also by design, said the director, known for cult classics like 'Ek Hasina Thi', 'Johnny Gaddar', 'Badlapur' and his biggest hit, 'Andhadhun'.

Raghavan said one of his earliest memories is watching Yash Chopra's 1969 thriller 'Ittefaq', starring Rajesh Khanna and Nanda, which was also set in the course of a night.

""I think one-night stories are a genre in themselves because there can be all kinds of stories. I remember seeing Yash Chopra's 'Ittefaq' and I was completely blown away by that movie and performances. Even 'Die Hard' (the 1988 Hollywood hit featuring Bruce Willis) was a one night and a Christmas story.

""I like the sub-genre of one-night stories because it's tough to hold the attention of the audience. It's exciting to think how you are going to compress time and space, and make the story work,"" he added.

'Merry Christmas', according to the filmmaker, is an intimate story of two mysterious strangers.

""You meet them on this particular day. What they were doing before, how much of what they are saying is true or false, it is all left to you to make assumptions as a viewer. These two strangers are meeting each other and the viewer is meeting each of them, and we have to figure out, 'Okay, what's happening here?' It just makes you curious,"" he teased.

Just like his films, chance played an important role in the unique casting of Kaif and Sethupathi.

Kaif had once spoken to Raghavan about doing a film that is ""out of her comfort zone"" and that conversation stayed with him.

""It is unlike the films she has done so far which largely, and I'm saying largely, project her as a very glamorous person. She once met me two years back and said she would love to do something in this sort of a zone. Luckily, I found this story,"" he recalled.

The director said he was looking for an ""oddball"" pairing, but most of the suggestions that came up for the leading man seemed a bit too familiar.

""By chance, I met Vijay Sethupathi in Melbourne, where he was getting an award for 'Super Deluxe' and Tabu was getting an award for 'Andhadhun'. In the flight, it was fortuitous that I happened to see '96', starring Sethupathi, and then I landed and met the actor.

""I told him, 'I just saw your movie' and in my mind I kept thinking, 'What if this is the guy?' He's a Tamilian who speaks Hindi as he has lived in Dubai for three years. The language is not really alien to him,"" he said.

Raghavan said he kept thinking about Sethupathi and finally spoke to his team. Later, they also came onboard with the idea.

""This casting is so oddball that I hope it will create curiosity. You can't write chemistry on paper. Chemistry has to be performed and enacted. It has to come through. What they have managed is difficult to achieve.""

For the Tamil version of 'Merry Christmas', Raghavan said they came up with a ""gibberish"" version of Tamil for Kaif, who had to learn the language for the film.

""Luckily, she did the Hindi version first and then the Tamil version. So, she had gone through the experience and knew the emotions behind the scene and character, so she managed beautifully."""
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/toni-braxton-and-rapper-birdman-breakup-after-marriage-rumors/articleshow/106494100.cms,"Toni Braxton wanted to kick off the new year without any misinformation. The 56-year-old R&B singer addressed rumors circulating on social media suggesting that she and her former fiancé, Birdman, had tied the knot over the New Year's Eve weekend.

On January 1, Toni took to Instagram to clarify, writing, ""My dear friend @birdman and I are not married... never been married. We are both single."" She accompanied her post with a screenshot of a headline declaring, ""Congratulations! Toni Braxton and Birdman Married in a Private Ceremony in Mexico,"" adding the hashtag, ""#fakenews.""

Despite appearances of a strong relationship just two months earlier, with a photo of a sweet kiss shared in November 2023, the singer deleted the image later, according to Complex.

The on-and-off relationship between the former couple reportedly began in 2016. Although they initially got engaged and later called it off in 2019, they continued to stay together. During that period, both Toni and Birdman unfollowed each other on Instagram.

Toni had previously spoken to PEOPLE about the evolution of her friendship with Birdman into something more. Describing him as her ""bestie for like 15 or 16 years,"" she highlighted their long-standing connection. Toni mentioned how Birdman had been a supportive presence at her baby showers, plays, and shows. Despite not anticipating a romantic relationship, Toni acknowledged Birdman's caring nature, especially during a challenging tour in 2016 when she fell ill.

Sharing the backstory, Toni recalled, ""Every night he would ask me, ‘Are you OK? Are you good?’ I said, ‘Oh my God, he’s such a great guy!’ When Birdman finally made his move, he told me he always liked me, and I was like, ‘You never told me!’ And he’s like, ‘Well, you were married!’ He said, ‘I was always digging you.’”

The annual mean land surface air temperature over India averaged 0.65° C above the long-term average for the 1981-2010 period, slightly lower than 0.71° C in 2016. Globally, 2023 was the warmest year on record, according to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). The impacts of warming - floods, excessive and uneven rainfall, cyclones, and droughts - were seen worldwide. Given that El Nino conditions are expected to prevail through April-June, this year could record further temperature increases.

Last year, India witnessed a series of extreme weather events, the last one being in Tamil Nadu in December. Chennai and some other districts saw intense flooding after Cyclone Michaung hit on December 4. While there was above-normal rainfall, the city's development trajectory that deprioritises its legacy is equally responsible for the large-scale destruction.

Shifting to pathways is critical. But it may not be enough. There must be a laser focus on and adequate funding to build climate resilience into the system. RBI estimates adaptation costs to be about Rs 85.6 lakh crore (at 2011-12 prices) by 2030. Building without due regard for and impacts will mean throwing good money down the drain and hurting the economy sooner than we think."

With Tuesday's incident, a total of 11 security personnel have been injured in different extremist attacks in Tengnoupal district since Saturday.

Reacting to the escalating violence, the Indigenous Tribal Leaders Forum (ITLF) and Committee on Tribal unity (CoTU) have declared 24-hour shutdown in all Kuki-Zo areas (from midnight of January 3 to Jan 4) to protest against the alleged atrocities of the Meitei state forces and to demand their removal from all Kuki-Zo districts.

They stated: ""The incursion of communal Meitei state forces into Moreh and the surrounding tribal areas during the ethnic conflict involving the two communities is clearly an attempt by the chief minister to drive out tribals from their homes using state machinery, and will never be tolerated by the Kuki-Zo people.""

""We urge the central government to remove all Meitei state forces, especially commandos, from Moreh and the surrounding tribal-majority settlements,"" they said.

Police officials in Imphal said the militants targeted the vehicles carrying police commandos and the BSF personnel when they were en route to Moreh. The militants fired on the security forces with sophisticated weapons while the police commandos and the BSF jawans were jointly conducting search operations to nab the rebels.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/new-ruling-on-benami-law-may-unearth-old-deals/articleshow/106493663.cms,"A single word, largely overlooked, in the tough 'Benami' law can exhume old ghosts. The past sins can come back to haunt a 'benamidar' and its partner in crime if an old deal, which may have been cut years ago, is still alive.

Even if a benami transaction had happened long before November 2016, when the new, amended statute came into force, the parties would face the wrath of the law today if the property or asset in question is still being 'held', according to a recent ruling.

""If somebody is 'holding' a subsequent to the amendment, it would come in the sweep of benami transaction(s),"" said the appellate tribunal on disputes on benami matters.

The ruling may rattle many who were under the belief that old deals would not come under glare following the apex court verdict that the law would not have retrospective effect.

""This is a significant ruling and the interpretation of the word ""held"" in the definition of ""benami transactions"" as adopted by the Appellate Tribunal will be tested at the higher courts as well. This interpretation, if upheld, could have wide ramifications,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at the law firm Khaitan & Co.
A benami deal is a transaction or an arrangement where a property or assets like stocks is ""transferred"" to or is ""held"" by a person but the consideration of such property has been provided or paid by another person. In other words, the holder of the asset (the front) is not its true beneficial owner.

For the Tribunal the word ""transferred"" is as significant as ""held"". ""The Tribunal cannot miss any word used in the statute...We cannot ignore the word ""held"" for giving proper interpretation of the definition of benami transaction...the two expression words, ""transfer"" and ""held"" under the amended provision need to read in conjunction,"" said the bench a fortnight ago while ruling against an appeal pertaining to a matter where purchase of shares by two companies, their generation of funds for carrying out the transaction, and the links between the buyers and the promoter of the investee company came under the scanner of the revenue authorities.

The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act came into effect from November 1, 2016, following amendment of a 28-year-old dormant law. While the enactment sparked a raft of notices and attachment of properties, many who were pulled up escaped the scrutiny of the law after the apex court in August 2022 declared the retrospective use of the as unconstitutional.

The present tribunal ruling, however, may open a Pandora's Box by making it clear that existence of a transaction, reflected in holding of an asset post November 2016, would be construed as continuance of the offence under the law.

The matter involved transfer of shares of in favour of two companies -- Prism Scan Express and Futurage Corporate Care. While in quashing the appeals of Bhageria, Prism and Futurage, the Tribunal observed that ""funds in the companies were not matching with the credentials of the directors"", the thrust of the ruling, which may set a precedent, rests in fact that the companies which purchased the shares were holding them not only on the date of amendment of the law in 2016 but even at the time of survey by the I-T Department for 2018-19."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/blake-sheltons-new-years-controversy-fans-unhappy-with-double-booking-debacle/articleshow/106494011.cms,"Country music star Blake Shelton found himself in hot water with fans during CBS' New Year's Eve special, leaving them puzzled and ultimately irked by a dual-performance stunt.

Shelton's presence was seemingly ubiquitous as he simultaneously appeared on CBS' ""New Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash"" and headlined a live performance at Winstar Casino in Oklahoma. The double-booking maneuver by Shelton and CBS sparked confusion among fans, questioning the authenticity of the promised live performances.

During the CBS special, Shelton joined forces with Trace Adkins for a performance of ""Hillybilly's Bone"" and ""Hell Right."" However, vigilant viewers quickly discerned that the supposedly live rendition was pre-recorded, contradicting the network's commitment to delivering live acts.

This discovery prompted a swift and robust backlash from fans who felt deceived by the false promises of live entertainment. Social media became a sounding board for disgruntled viewers expressing their discontent with both Blake Shelton and CBS.

On CBS' Instagram page, one fan pointed out the inconsistency, stating, ""Strange it's Live when Blake Shelton is in Oklahoma doing a concert at a casino."" Another follower questioned the authenticity, writing, ""How is this live when Blake is in Oklahoma doing a concert in Winstar tonight?""

The irony did not escape the audience, as another fan humorously remarked, ""Funny as hell since Blake was in Oklahoma."" A tongue-in-cheek comment suggested, ""Blake Shelton needs to stop his imposters.""

The collective sentiment among fans reflected disappointment and frustration, emphasizing the importance of authenticity when it comes to live performances and televised events. While some found humor in the situation, Shelton and CBS faced considerable backlash for the perceived attempt to deceive the audience.

As 2023 concluded, the incident served as a memorable and controversial moment, leaving Blake Shelton to navigate the aftermath of a New Year's Eve performance that didn't quite hit the right notes with his fanbase. It remains to be seen how Shelton and CBS will address the fallout from the double-booking controversy and whether future promises of live performances will be met with a more critical eye from fans.

FAQs:
Why did Blake leave The Voice?
Shelton exited The Voice in May 2023 to prioritize his family life, particularly in his role as a stepfather to Stefani's children.

This gives the commission more elbow room to go about strengthening fiscal federalism. On paper, its job is to ensure balance in resource transfers between the Centre and states, and among states. But the task is nuanced. States grudgingly relinquish their resource-raising capacity and resent any loss of agency over expenditure. The Centre, on its part, would like to see the larger devolution to states put to responsible use and tries to nudge states towards fiscal responsibility. States also need to be convinced that the formula for dividing resources does not disincentivise outperformance and delivers on curbing unwarranted migration.

The 16th Finance Commission has the freedom to choose its population data. But it will not have the 2021 census data to go by. Population is a key determinant of how much a state receives as its share of the divisible pool of . States that have stabilised their population growth, and, thereby, bumped up their per-capita income, would have gone further down that path between 2011 and 2021. Without the 2021 data, however, there would have to be an approximation of the performance of lagging states. The extent of migration over a decade would also involve an element of uncertainty. This makes assessment of outcomes more difficult than it should be.

The Centre now draws less from the combined resource pool than the states, but is directing spending through and welfare payments. As the gap widens, states would need more unencumbered finance for their larger responsibility. The Centre is trying moral policing to drive fiscal prudence, but is not in a position to lead by example. This will be a subtext for further devolution."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india-bloc-meetings-only-decide-further-dates-west-bengal-bjp-state-president-dilip-ghosh/articleshow/106492784.cms,"Kolkata: West Bengal BJP leadership expressed doubts about the INDIA alliance which have allegedly failed to take any decisive move yet and it has been created to mislead people, former BJP state President Dilip Ghosh said on Tuesday.

“INDIA Bloc meetings only decide further dates. Only dates after dates are fixed (Tarikh pe Tarikh). This has been a trend for a long time. The opposition parties come together against the ruling parties and fight against them. When Congress was in power, opposition parties came together and the same is happening before any Lok Sabha elections,” Ghosh said. “People are watching the drama and they know what to do in the elections and have faith on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.”

Notably, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut on Monday said that no meeting has been held for the appointment of a convener or chairperson of the Opposition INDIA alliance.

“There is an attempt to keep their identities intact. Last time, it was Mamata Banerjee, who had ambition to become the Prime Minister, took the initiative. This time it was Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar who took the initiative. After taking the initiative, Nitish Babu has disappeared,” Ghosh, who is part of the BJP’s core election team, told ET.

""Similar Alliance was planned last time with Mamata Banerjee leading last time,” Ghosh said, when asked about the INDIA bloc and the seat sharing deal which was scheduled before December 31 but yet to get worked out.

With Lok Sabha polls approaching, rifts among the Opposition's INDIA bloc seem to become evident with various alliance partners refusing to accept seat-sharing arrangements. One such example is West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee who intends to go alone in Bengal, keeping the alliance intact in the country.

Meanwhile, recently, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut asserted the party's demand of contesting 23 seats for the Lok Sabha polls 2024 including in Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/s-jaishankar-on-why-economic-choices-cant-be-divorced-from-a-strategic-context/articleshow/106493897.cms,"Since the drive for prosperity is a constant endeavour for all societies, it is natural that policymaking is also devoted to this goal. The most obvious expression of that is the promotion of trade and investments. Just building capabilities at home, however, may not be adequate. Securing business abroad needs information, networking and access. There is a virtuous cycle at work here, whereby greater trade and economic activity strengthens skills, capabilities and employment.

In the last few years, India achieved ambitious export goals that would have been considered unrealistic till just recently. Now, this is not just a substantial increase in aspiration, but one realised as the world economy is still recovering from the Covid pandemic. The basis for this confidence is a range of reforms in manufacturing, labour, finance, skills and trade facilitation. Added to that is a steady improvement in the ease of doing business.

Foreign commercial policy is being tasked to obtain access to markets and lower trade barriers. This can be done in an orthodox way but hastened through negotiated understandings, including FTAs and global supply chains. That may be an objective in itself; its larger significance for employment and prosperity are obvious.

Increasingly, foreign policy contributes to the creation of new capacities at home. In Asia, all modernising economies have single-mindedly focused their external interactions on obtaining capital, technology and best practices from abroad. Newer challenges like green growth and climate action have started to open up more possibilities. Our partners have expanded from the older industrialised economies to more innovative ones.

The resources and opportunities provided by external collaborations speed up the natural growth of the domestic economy. Valuable as they are, they do not, however, substitute the continuous nurturing of deep strengths at home.

Three decades ago, India embarked on much-needed reforms and opened up its economy. The benefits of doing so are undisputed. However, in the name of efficiency and modernity, easy options were taken at the expense of our SMEs. Instead of building effective domestic supply chains, we opted for integration and value-addition that were more profitable and less painstaking.

Infrastructure projects were given out to others without any effort to absorb learnings for our own industry. The pursuit of short-term gains made us lose ambition and, with that, a sense of strategy. As a result, economic growth did not witness the commensurate scaling up of employment, skills, strengths and capacities.

In the last decade, we have awoken to the realisation that mantras about globalisation, if mindlessly applied, can cause real damage. Not just that, if economic choices are divorced from a strategic context, it could lead the country down a very dangerous path. The real debate is not whether we should be an open or a protected economy. It is whether we are an employment-centric and capability-driven one, or just a profit-obsessed society content to be a market.

Along with vulnerabilities, a dependent mindset has also been rationalised, which masquerades as globalised thinking. India's destiny is bigger than to be just a part of the future of others. Real growth is not only about GDP increase; it is equally about infrastructure, supply chains, skills, finance and socioeconomic progress. When we sacrifice the latter for the former, our long-term prospects are imperilled. We could slide into strategic lock-ins without even being aware. Foreign policy is surely an instrument to advance our strategic course. It is equally an insurance that our big picture is the right one.

In an era of more interdependence and interpenetration, it is also expected that all nations will seek to expand their zones of deep influence beyond their national boundaries. In the past, trade, finance, military activities and migration were some of the means to do so. Nowadays, the role of connectivity and socioeconomic collaboration has become more salient. This is an important realisation for a nation like India, whose reach was constrained by Partition.

As we grow in different dimensions, strategic sense dictates that our prosperity serves as a larger incentive for the entire region. Realising this, the Modi government has significantly expanded connectivity and collaborative initiatives with neighbours. Its results are evident in new road and rail connections, waterways, port access and transit rights, power grids and fuel flows, and especially in the movement of people.

Interdependence, however, has its own downside and can be leveraged unfairly when global norms are cast aside. Exposure to competitive polities, therefore, needs constant monitoring. We cannot always assume that all others will play by the rules. For that reason, as an interpreter of the world, diplomacy is also voice of caution. It informs a society of the risks and pitfalls even as it explains opportunities.

Doing so in a systemic and organised manner is part of formulating strategy. By its very nature, foreign policy develops a comprehensive outlook and can guide other sectors. It could be trade and technology, or education and tourism. Current times, in particular, require a holistic approach to relationships.

A stronger and more capable India, one truer to its roots and culture, is a key factor in the larger rebalancing that characterises our contemporary world. In an era that is more globalised, our talents, capabilities and contribution have a growing value for the rest of the world. As we celebrate 75 years of Independence, there is good cause for Bharat to be confident about its prospects."

The CBI had filed the case on August 23, 2023, on the request of the Manipur government and had taken over investigation in a case that was earlier registered at the Imphal police station on a complaint against a minor boy. It was alleged that the complainant's minor daughter was missing since July 6, 2023, and was kidnapped by the minor boy with an intention to marry her without her consent.

On the other hand, the father of the boy had also registered an FIR at Lamphel police station, Imphal West, against unknown persons alleging that his son (17 years), left his house on his bike on July 6, 2023 morning and since then had not returned. It was alleged that he might have been kidnapped.

The investigation of both the inter-related cases (arising out of the same facts) revealed that on July 6, the boy went to the tuition class of the minor girl and picked her up. She rode pillion with him and proceeded towards Bishnupur side and from there to Thas View Point Area on old Cachar Road. At that spot, the boy and girl were intercepted and held captive by the accused who forcibly put the victims (boy and girl) in a vehicle. They were taken to an undisclosed location. They are suspected to have been killed. Four accused persons were arrested during the investigation and are currently in judicial custody."

State ministers J Chinchu Rani and Roshy Augustine visited 15-year-old Mathew, the distressed young farmer, at his house in Velliyamattom village this morning and offered support and assistance from the state government.

Besides Kerala ministers, actor Jayaram also lent a helping hand to the teenaged Kerala farmer. While the ruling CPI (M) offered to give two cows, business giant Lulu group handed over an amount of Rs five lakh to the family to buy 10 cows. Actor Jayaram, known for his love of animals, also visited the boy's house and handed over a cheque of Rs 5 lakh to buy new cows and rebuild his farm.

Jayaram said the film crew of the Malayalam movie 'Abraham Ozler', in which he stars, has opted to cancel the scheduled trailer launch event on January 4, and instead decided to donate the Rs 5 lakh allocated for it to Matthew's family. Additionally, Jayaram conveyed to Mathew that actors Mammootty and Prithviraj will also be contributing financial aid of Rs 1 lakh and Rs 2 lakh, respectively.

Earlier, Animal Husbandry Minister Chinchu Rani said that steps would be taken to hand over five insured cows to the young farmer soon. Cattle feed for one month would also be made available to him free of cost at the earliest, she said after visiting the young farmer and his family. Furthermore, a financial assistance of Rs 45,000 from the Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (Milma) would also be ensured for the distressed farmer, she added. ""All five cows will be of good breed. They will be given after they are insured. If any casualty happens to the cattle, he would get back the entire amount,"" she told reporters. The minister, accompanied by Water Resources Minister Augustine, also advised Mathew to grow grass on unused properties in the area to ensure good-quality feed for the cattle.

Actor Jayaram, after handing over the cheque, said he could understand the sorrow of the young farmer and his family over the deaths of their dear cows. ""Everything will be alright soon,"" the actor said, consoling them. He also told the farmer that he would help him buy high-bred cows from Krishnagiri in Tamil Nadu at a good price. After learning about the plight of the teenaged farmer from the media, Lulu Group chairman M A Yusuffali directed his company officials to visit their home and provide immediate assistance. CPI(M) sources revealed that the party's state secretary, M V Govindan, contacted Mathew and his family members over the phone to offer consolation. He also extended the offer of providing them with two cows.

Thirteen of Mathew's 20 cows died on Sunday, following which he became distressed and was hospitalised. Preliminary reports suggest that the cattle might have been affected by a poisonous substance called hydrocyanic acid (HCN) present in the tapioca skin used as feed, a non-conventional but cost-effective food for cattle, a government official said.

Three of the cows that survived are under treatment, while another cow with four calves has survived. The losses incurred by Mathew is estimated to be around Rs 6 lakh, officials said, adding that unfortunately, the family had not insured the cows. The boy, who took over the farm two years ago at the age of 13 after his father's untimely demise, relied on tapioca leaves as an economical alternative to conventional cattle feed. Mathew's brother George and younger sister assist him with managing the farm."

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/speaking-tree/salesman-and-two-boats/articleshow/106494000.cms,"I have heard about a man who was seen as a great salesman. His company was very proud of him. The company, dealing in real estate, had been unable to sell a big plot of land that had been with them for years. But the salesman sold the plot. A fortnight after the sale, it started to rain and the plot was about 15 ft under water. The man who had purchased it came to the dealer's office and said, 'Your salesman sold me a plot that is now under 15 ft of water. It has become a big lake. I want my money back.'

The salesman was called, and he said, 'Here, take your money with interest because I have lots of buyers. You can make a beautiful house on it after the rains, and when the rains come again, you can make arrangements so that the water does not flow out. You will have a lake palace. And I will give you two boats.' And he sold two boats to the man. The dealer was watching the scene. The boats were absolutely useless. But the salesman said, 'Don't worry, if I can manage that big a trouble, I can manage two boats.'

You just have to create a desire in people. The buyer was only thinking of making a house, but his desire and ambition were changed to a lake palace. For centuries, man has been sold beliefs, dogmas that are untrue, that have no evidence, except in your ambition. You don't want to do anything, and you want to reach heaven. And there are people ready to give you maps, shortcuts.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/why-it-would-be-a-challenging-year-for-us-india-and-their-relations/articleshow/106493867.cms,"It will be a year of living dangerously. The main challenge for the US and India in 2024 will be to stay focused on the relationship and manage the frictions while conducting that essential dance of democracy called national elections. Differences and disappointments may register a slight uptick, whether from India's pursuit of multi-alignment or America's demands to 'prove that you care'.

The two wars will take a further toll on both countries in material and political terms. President faces a mountain of criticism for not doing enough in one () and doing too much in the other (). Countries with a huge axe to grind will hit targets to force the hand of others. Two India-bound oil tankers - MV Sai Baba and MV Chem Pluto - have come under drone attacks from Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the last 10 days. Of the 47 crew members on the two ships, 46 were Indian. That's significant.

While India and others, including American allies, haven't joined the US-led Operation Prosperity Guardian to protect commerce in the Red Sea, the has sent five warships to the Arabian Sea. It has also deployed P-8I surveillance aircraft for 'complete maritime domain awareness'. As a freshly inducted member of the multinational Combined Maritime Forces, the Indian Navy is doing its job as a net security provider in the region. All countries benefit from order on the seas, but many have chosen not to commit for fear of becoming .

Moving to the other war launched by India's old friend, Russia, the costs may be heavier and more far-reaching. While foreign minister S Jaishankar made a significantly long five-day trip to Russia last week, complete with a meeting with President Vladimir , it's unclear when the Russian weapons India awaits will begin arriving and how payments would be made. From the remaining S-400 Triumf air defence systems (only two were delivered), to frigates to even AK-203 assault rifles, things are stuck somewhere between sanctions and shortages. Last October, Russia's state agency for - Rosoboronexport - went public about 'pressing challenges facing the Russian defence industry' and how its 'top priority' was supplying to the .

But Jaishankar's visit, which generated some interest here, was about more than weapons. Reinforcing the idea of a multipolar world with India and Russia as mutually reassuring poles was a big part. The need to keep all friends and partners in good humour - a necessity in a fluid world - was another. Given the recent difficulties in India-US ties over the alleged plot to kill a Khalistani, the length and breadth of Jaishankar's Russia visit was seen by some as a signal to the US. Fortunately, the Biden administration has successfully compartmentalised India's relationship with Russia even if the commentariat hasn't. There's a mature understanding that India remains dependent on Russia for defence equipment and that relations with the US are 'qualitatively' different.

Besides dealing with the second- and third-order effects of the wars, the world's largest and oldest democracies will hold elections this year. India is unlikely to spring a surprise, but the US could, for which all must brace themselves. Constitutional questions about who has the right to be on the ballot are just a start. Donald Trump's fate may be decided by the Supreme Court - Colorado and Maine have barred him from the primaries for his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.

Outside players are already active to sow more discord and create more polarisation with fake news, deepfakes and every which way technology can be misused. Facebook recently shut down around 5,000 fake accounts created in China. Then there's Israel's war that is playing havoc with Democratic Party voters. The young are abandoning Biden as they watch American munitions rain down on Gaza. At the same time, the Hamas attack may have spelt the end of the extreme 'woke' movement when students, professors and activists justified the horror and condemned Israel before it had taken any action. Presidents of Ivy League universities made fools of themselves, dodging the question whether calling for the genocide of Jews violated their codes of conduct. Biden has a tough task with his party's woke wing.

Biden has an equally difficult challenge with illegal immigration. Too bad Indians have become part of the problem with numbers soaring to over 96,000 last year - a hugely embarrassing statistic for a country moving to become a $4 trillion economy. And to say nothing about the state from which more than 300 chartered a plane to escape. In a 'Trump scenario', the issue could become a 'wall' and a real problem in bilateral relations."

""Until the next meeting of the All India Motor Transport Congress is held no laws will be imposed,"" said Amritlal Madan, President of AIMTC.

""We had a discussion with All India Motor Transport Congress representatives, govt wants to say that the new rule has not been implemented yet, we all want to say that before implementing Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 106/2, we will have a discussion with All India Motor Transport Congress representatives and then only we will take a decision,"" said Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla.

Further, the Government and the transporters appeal to the truck drivers to resume work.

The truck and bus drivers, along with petrol pumps were protesting against the newly enacted Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS), which has a provision for hit-and-run cases. The new penal actions in hit-and-run cases have raised concerns among drivers who now face the possibility of a 10-year jail term for fleeing and not reporting fatal accidents.

Some truck, bus and tanker operators began a three-day strike on Monday against the new rules and have blockaded roads and highways across states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.

A panic situation was created among citizens amid fears of shortage of fuel. Nearly 2,000 petrol pumps, mostly in western and northern India, have run out of fuel stocks as the strike by some truckers' associations entered the second day, PTI had reported.

Under the previous legislation, drivers could be imprisoned for up to two years under IPC Section 304A (death by negligence). The protesting drivers are demanding the repeal of these new provisions, asserting that the stringent penalties are a threat to their livelihoods.

There are about 1 lakh trucks that ferry petrol and diesel as well as LPG from oil company depots to petrol pumps and gas distribution agencies.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/jeffrey-epstein-court-filings-unsealed-in-new-york-heres-what-you-should-expect/articleshow/106493603.cms,"In the imminent days, a comprehensive list detailing individuals associated with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is set to be disclosed. This revelation is anticipated to shed new light on the intricate web of sex trafficking orchestrated by Epstein, who met his demise in 2019, and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. The disgraced millionaire was known for his associations with prominent figures from the realms of politics, business, and royalty.

A court order has mandated the unveiling of court documents related to a lawsuit linked to Maxwell, the daughter of a British media tycoon. The lawsuit, filed by Virginia Giuffre, one of Maxwell's accusers, resulted in a 20-year prison term for Maxwell. Previously under seal, the identities in the lawsuit, often referred to as ""J Doe,"" will now be disclosed with their real names, totaling 187 mentions.

The disclosure is a consequence of a defamation lawsuit brought by Giuffre, and the judge's ruling in New York last month paved the way for these names to be made public. Judge Loretta Preska acknowledged that many of the individuals were already publicly identified by the media or during Maxwell's trial, and others did not object to the release of the documents.

While some names, particularly those of child victims, will remain sealed, there is an anticipation that the list will encompass a mix of individuals accused of wrongdoing, accusers, and potential witnesses to the crimes. Notably, Prince Andrew is expected to be on the list, with court filings including evidence from a woman who accused him of sexual misconduct. Similarly, former U.S. President Bill Clinton is mentioned numerous times, primarily in relation to his association with Epstein on humanitarian trips.

The impending revelation of the Epstein list has sparked intrigue and speculation about the extent of involvement of high-profile figures and the nature of their relationships with Epstein and Maxwell. As the disclosures unfold, it remains to be seen whether these revelations will bring forth new details and perspectives, potentially reshaping public understanding of the scandal that has captivated global attention.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/jharkhand-cm-hemant-soren-rejects-possibility-of-wife-contesting-polls-as-bjps-imagination/articleshow/106493283.cms,"Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren on Tuesday dismissed speculations of his wife Kalpana Soren contesting from Gandey assembly constituency in the state and termed it as a ""complete imagination"" of the BJP. There is not an iota of truth in the speculations, said Soren who is the executive president of the JMM.

""Possibility of my wife contesting in the near future is a complete imagination of the BJP... The speculation about handing over reins to her is a fabric woven by the BJP to build a false narrative,"" the chief minister told PTI.

The speculations were triggered by the Enforcement Directorate's recent summons to the chief minister coupled with the sudden resignation by the ruling JMM's Gandey MLA Sarfaraz Ahmad on Monday.

The opposition BJP has claimed that Ahmad was made to quit so that the chief minister's wife Kalpana Soren could contest from the Gandey seat in case of any eventuality in connection with the ED summonses.

Soren has been in the eye of a political storm after the ED summonses in an alleged corruption case involving an office of profit case. Besides, the Election Commission had sent a letter to the then governor of Jharkhand Ramesh Bais in August 2022 which is believed to have recommended his disqualification as an MLA as a mining lease given to him was renewed during his tenure as the state's chief minister.

However, neither Bais nor his successor CP Radhakrishnan opened that letter.

According to a close aide of the chief minister, making the Gandey seat vacant is a ""masterstroke"".

Elaborating, he said that there are chances that the governor would open the letter during the ED's questioning of Soren and give the mandatory permission to the agency to act against the chief minister.

If Soren has to relinquish his membership in the assembly, he can continue as the CM for six months without being elected. After that period is over, the provision for holding a by-election will not exist as Assembly polls are due in November-December. So, effectively Soren will continue as the chief minister till the next assembly elections, he said.

In case Soren decides to contest the by-poll, he would do it from Gandey and not his present constituency Barhati as that would send a ""wrong signal"" to the people, he said.

""Without any armour, he (Soren) would have been trapped. The CM wants to give a message that you (central agencies) do whatever you want to do but I am ready,"" Soren's close associate said.

Meanwhile, sources in the Chief Minister's Office told PTI that the timeline for reply to the fresh summons by the ED to Soren will end on January 5.

The ruling JMM-led coalition has convened a meeting of its legislators here on Wednesday to discuss the present political scenario in the backdrop of the ED's summons to Soren as well as to chalk out a strategy.

In its latest summons to Soren, the ED has asked him to inform the investigating officer about the date, venue, and time of his choice so that his statement could be recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

Soren has skipped six earlier summonses by ED accusing the BJP-led union government of using central agencies to destabilise his democratically elected government. The seventh summons was issued last month.

He had filed petitions before the Supreme Court and Jharkhand High Court seeking protection from ED's actions, terming the summonses ""unwarranted"". Both courts dismissed his petitions.

The CMO has sent a letter to the ED in which he is believed to have accused the agency of selectively leaking information to the media.

Meanwhile, BJP state president Babulal Marandi has said that a delegation will meet Governor C P Radhakrishnan and urge him to seek suggestions from legal experts and the attorney general in case the Hemant Soren government proposes to anoint the chief minister's wife as his successor.

The ED has arrested 14 people in the mining lease case, including IAS officer Chhavi Ranjan, who had previously served as the director of the state social welfare department and the deputy commissioner of Ranchi.

The JN. 1 coronavirus strain has newly emerged along with the concerns about monkeypox in central Africa, and the spread of diseases carried by mosquitos in newer countries, because of climate change.

According to Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, who is an expert on contagious diseases, the increasing number of Covid cases is not a surprise. She states how there has been no occurrence of COVID-19 on a periodic level, but about the other respiratory illnesses, we can witness their rise in the months of winter and autumn in temperate areas.

This is the reason for vaccination campaigns starting a little early for COVID-19, and influenza, with the target group being those who are at greater risk of it. However, according to her, the vaccination coverage in the countries constituting the groups who are at risk is very bad.

She says: “The biggest point of disappointment is that solutions are there for everything starting from influenza to COVID-19, which can help to prevent extreme diseases and even death. The question is why are they not being used ?”

Spread of Dengue and Climate Change
At the gathering of global leaders to discuss the fight against climate change previously this month, it was pointed out that global warming is affecting infectious diseases’ spread, as per Dr Van Kerkhove. For instance, Dengue fever is a virus transferred to humans through mosquitoes.

It is perceived that mosquitos that carry dengue virus will become common in England within the 2040s.

Outbreak of monkeypox
An outbreak of monkeypox was also pointed out by Dr Van Kerkhove in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in central Africa. Monkeypox is a disease that is caused by an infection due to the mpox virus which are of two types: Clade I and Clade II.

Clade I has a higher degree of risk of death, with a 10% fatality rate. Clade II is in general lenient and was spreading in Europe according to Dr Van Kerkhove.

Contagious disease in war zones
The Israel–Hamas war and the Ukraine-Russia wars dominate 2024, with a range of other conflicts that are not reported from all across the world.

Medical professionals are at greater risk of getting those infectious diseases, because of the demolition of the homes of the people and the despairing war conditions. It leads to the creation of difficult conditions where people are not nourished enough without any access to proper waste systems and clean water, moreover, they remain cold.

According to Dr Van Kerkhove, the people who feel threatened and scared, will suffer more when there is a spread of infectious diseases.

FAQs:
What are the health threats that have emerged in 2024?
2024 is going to be plagued by new health threats which include the emergence of the JN. 1 coronavirus strain, monkeypox, mosquito carrier diseases, as well as climate change.

What is having an impact on the spread of infectious diseases?
At the gathering of global leaders to discuss the fight against climate change previously this month, it was pointed out that global warming is affecting infectious diseases’ spread, as per Dr Van Kerkhove

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/wearables-firm-ultrahuman-says-revenue-growing-20-on-month/articleshow/106493088.cms,"Ultrahuman, which sells wearable devices and services that help users track metabolic health, is witnessing 20% month-on-month growth in revenue and is targeting to cross $50 million in annual run rate (ARR) by March, its founder and chief executive said.

The Bengaluru-based startup is currently clocking an ARR — annualised revenue based on current monthly revenue — of about $31 million, Mohit Kumar told ET. He said at the current rate of growth, it must first focus on turning a profit before considering a public sale of shares.

“At a scale of around $100 million in ARR, a slightly different and slower strategy may appeal to startups. But at the scale we are growing towards $50 million, it is important that we focus on profitability faster before exploring choices such as an IPO or non-conventional forms of capital raises,” Kumar said.

Ultrahuman, Kumar said, posted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in the past three months. Its monthly Ebitda margin is 6% currently, the CEO said.

For the ongoing fiscal 2024, Kumar projected the company post $14.5 million in revenue, with a loss of $1.26 million before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.

The Nexus Venture Partners-backed startup had posted an Ebitda loss of $6.76 million on revenue of $3.65 million in fiscal 2023.

Ultrahuman’s products and services include continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices and software, smart rings and lately, blood testing.

On December 15, Ultrahuman launched Blood Vision, an at-home blood-testing service that the company claims takes into account age and a population’s genetic makeup among other factors to understand leading preventive health indicators, such as specific types of protein responsible for cardiovascular diseases. The service is currently live in seven cities in India.

Ultrahuman makes 25% of its revenue from India, 30% from the US and 15% from the UK and UAE, with the rest coming from other markets. About 15% of its sales are business to business and 20% are closed through offline distribution channels.

With customers using its CGM services about three times a year, Kumar said the company has an active paying user base of about 120,000.

In its revenue from operations of Rs 19.83 crore in FY23, about Rs 16.19 crore was from subscriptions and CGM services, while Rs 3.34 crore was from the sale of smart rings.

In November, Finnish wearables startup Oura Health sued Ultrahuman in the US, accusing it of patent and copyright violations.

The startup has so far raised capital from the likes of Alpha Wave Incubation, Steadview Capital and Nexus. The company closed its latest round of funding last year, an extension of Series B, at $5 million from investors such as former a16z general partner Balaji Srinivasan and AngelList founder Naval Ravikant, Kumar told ET."

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/151-fleeing-myanmar-soldiers-flown-home-after-refugee-stay-in-mizoram/articleshow/106493425.cms,"Guwahati: Around 151 soldiers from Myanmar, who fled to Mizoram after their camps were captured were flown back home on a Myanmar military aircraft on Tuesday.

Officials said that a Myanmar Air Force aircraft landed at the Lengpui airport here on Tuesday afternoon to take back the soldiers.

""A Myanmar Air Force transport plane from Mandalay (Myanmar) landed at Lengpui airport and evacuated 151 Myanmar soldiers to Akyab in two sorties. Before the departure of the Myanmarese soldiers, the Indian authorities have completed all necessary formalities,"" a senior official said.


According to officials, the Myanmar soldiers on Friday fled to Mizoram’s Lawngtlai district with their arms and ammunition, and approached the Assam Rifles after their camps near the India-Myanmar border were overrun by the Arakan Army fighters.

Some of the fleeing Myanmar soldiers were critically injured in the gun battle and basic medical treatment was provided to them by the Assam Rifles. The soldiers were in the custody of Assam Rifles at Parva in Lawngtlai.


In November, a total of 104 Myanmar soldiers, including officers, fled to Mizoram in different phases after their camps near the border were overrun by pro-democracy armed groups.


Since November 13, several Myanmar soldiers fled to the Indian territory in different phases after their camps in Chin state were captured by the Chin National Defence Force, the armed wing of the Chin National Organisation.


They were earlier airlifted by the Indian Air Force to Moreh in Manipur, from where they were repatriated to Tamu, the nearest town on the Myanmar side.

Besides soldiers, several thousand Myanmarese civilians, including women and children, took shelter in Mizoram's Champhai and other districts since last month following the gunfights between Myanmar Army and CNDF cadres.

Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh last week said that due to prevailing unrest in the neighbouring country around 6,000 people from Myanmar have taken shelter in his state in the recent past. Mizoram and Manipur share 518 km and 398 km unfenced borders with Myanmar, respectively.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/world-introvert-day-hate-small-talk-struggle-over-presentations-5-tips-to-help-you-survive-at-the-workplace/articleshow/106493057.cms,"It’s not easy being an introvert in a world that celebrates, cherishes, and even rewards extroversion.

From boardrooms to party venues, it seems the world is the playground of the social butterflies. It also makes sense in a way.

Gregarious people can talk on multiple subjects with ease, ooze likeability, wit, and charm. They are blessed with tons of social grace and tact and so are pretty much irresistible in all social circles. They are often described in various epithets such as “life of the party,” “superstar” etc.

In a world ruled by extroverts, introverts seem to be fated to languish in the background, be the wallflower to the extrovert’s sunflower.

Although introversion exists on a spectrum - some of us can talk exhaustively on particular subjects, others are on the more extreme side of the spectrum and may suffer from bouts of debilitating social anxiety and may struggle to hold conversations with new people. For them, even something as mundane as making small talk with an acquaintance can be exhausting.

In general, introverts are people who prefer being alone and can ‘recharge’ themselves only when they are by themselves. Although not all of them are loners and can seek company from time to time, they may feel lost in the crowd or if made to entertain a huge amount of people for a long time.

Being an introvert in the workplace can be exhausting. Often your silence and unwillingness to hang out at water coolers and office lunches may be misconstrued as arrogance or rudeness.

Moreover, if you are not someone who is vocal and is afraid of confrontations, there is also the risk of being bypassed for promotions, not being given your due, or worse, becoming a sitting target for bullies.

Worried about how to navigate the workplace if you are an introvert? Read on to find out…

You Don’t Have To Be The Workplace Charmer
Conversation not your strong point? Don’t worry. You don’t have to be the residential small-talk expert. Keep your conversations clear, calibrated, and focused on your work. You don’t have to go out of your way to be a charmer.

Remember, your charming, extroverted co-worker is there for the same reason as you - to meet deadlines.

Be Empathetic
Introversion doesn’t mean you have to be devoid of empathy. If you come to know that a colleague is battling a health scare or someone close to them is, don’t forget to ask about health updates!

Be Proud Of Your Strengths!
So what, if spontaneity, presentation skills, and networking are not your strengths? Introverts have virtues such as patience, are usually great listeners, are often more objective, and are better at reading between the lines.

When In Doubt, Prepare
Do you have to make a presentation to the board? Then prepare a speech, and go through the content again and again, so that you don’t come across as clueless.

Stand Your Ground
Not all, but many introverts fear confrontation and they may become helpless if faced with an adversary who is great at twisting words to their end.

Document all the work that you do. If necessary, CC and BCC it to your manager, so that no one can claim credit.

Facing rude/toxic behaviour from a co-worker? If you find confronting them exhausting, just limit yourself to emailing or messaging when interacting with them. If their behaviour becomes intolerable or devolves into bullying, inform the HR."

This is staggering growth for UPI payments service in the country which recorded around 74 billion transactions in 2022 and 38.7 billion transactions in 2021.

Monthly transactions on UPI have seen an over 49% jump between January and December in 2023, data from NPCI showed.

For December 2023, UPI payments touched 12.02 billion transactions with payments worth Rs 18.23 lakh crore being processed by the service. This represented a 54% year-on-year growth in terms of volume and 42% growth in value annually.

ET had reported in December that UPI Autopay, the recurring payment mandate run by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) on the UPI payment mode, has also been steadily gaining steam, especially for bill and subscription payments in the country. The gaining of popularity of could also be attributed to the increase in the number of use-cases for which the service could be used. This included payments, insurance and card bills payments in the country.

Recent enhancements of transaction limits to Rs 1 lakh from Rs 15,000 previously has also led to the growth of the UPI Autopay feature, both in terms of volumes and value."

Dismissing speculation about bidding farewell to the area, Joel emphatically stated, ""Just because I’m selling that house doesn’t mean I’m leaving Long Island,"" emphasizing his continued residence in Sag Harbor.

Injecting humor into the conversation, the 74-year-old singer shared jestingly about his decision to sell his Centre Island estate, humorously remarking, ""I’m just gonna spend a little more time in Florida like old Jewish guys from Long Island do."" He candidly acknowledged the challenging prospect of finding a buyer for his sprawling five-bedroom, eight-bathroom manor named Middlesea.

Having initially purchased the property for $22.5 million in 2002, Joel devoted several years to restoring the estate before listing it for sale. Despite a brief withdrawal from the market, Joel clarified during the concert that he awaits the completion of ongoing renovations before finalizing the sale.

While Joel already owns a residence in Manalapan, Fla., reports suggest his interest in exploring additional properties within the Sunshine State. His New Year's Eve performance, spanning from 10:30 p.m. to 1 a.m., captivated audiences and culminated in a vibrant rendition of ""Auld Lang Syne"" at midnight.

This event marked a significant juncture amidst Joel's record-breaking 10-year residency at Madison Square Garden, slated to conclude in July.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ahead-of-market-10-things-that-will-decide-d-street-action-on-wednesday/articleshow/106492746.cms,"India's benchmark indices fell on Tuesday, dragged by financials, auto, and information technology stocks, as selling pressure emerged at near record high levels. The bluechip NSE Nifty 50 fell 0.35% to 21,666 points, while the S&P BSE Sensex shed 0.53% to 71,892.

Here's how analysts read the market pulse:

""A bearish candle has emerged on the daily Nifty chart, indicating a potential bearish trend in the near future. Sentiment is expected to stay bearish as long as it remains below 21,750. Any upward movement toward 21,750 could encounter selling pressure. However, a clear breakout above 21,750 could shift sentiment in favor of the bulls. Support is established at 21,500 on the lower end,"" said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.

Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking, said, ""The underperformance of the banking majors is largely weighing on the sentiment amid consolidation, and a decisive close above 21,800 in Nifty would prompt the next leg of the up move. Meanwhile, we feel it is prudent to prefer defensive viz. FMCG, pharma and stay selective in others.""

That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Wednesday's action:

is starting 2024 weakly on Tuesday and giving back some of its powerful gains from the year before.
The S&P 500 was 0.7% lower in morning trading after pulling to the brink of its all-time high set roughly two years ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 56 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:50 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.5% lower.

Europe's benchmark stock index erased its initial gains and slipped on Tuesday, led by technology and chemicals, as traders bid adieu to an upbeat 2023 that was fuelled by expectations of nearing interest rate cuts.

The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.5% by 1320 GMT, coming off the 23-month high hit intraday, with euro zone government bond yields also on the rise.

Nifty on Tuesday ended 76 points lower to form a reasonable negative candle on the daily chart with a minor lower shadow, which technical analysts say indicates a reversal in the short term.

Positive chart patterns like higher tops and bottoms are intact on the daily chart and present consolidation/weakness is in line with the formation of new higher bottoms of the sequence. The bottom reversal needs to be confirmed at the lows. A slide below the immediate support of 21,500 could open some more weakness for the near term. A sustainable move above 21,840 could bring bulls back into action, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities.

Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence () showed bullish trade on the counters of Oracle Financial Services, Dr Lal Pathlabs, Abbott India, Granules India, BHEL, and Rashtriya Chemicals, among others.

The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

The MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of Bikaji Foods International, DCM Shriram Titan Company, Cyient, EID Parry, and SBI among others. A bearish crossover on the MACD on these counters indicated that they had just begun their downward journey.

HDFC Bank (Rs 2,481 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 1,604 crore), Coal India (Rs 1,108 crore), Tata Motors (Rs 1,086 crore), SBI (Rs 971 crore), RIL (Rs 967 crore), and Kotak Bank (Rs 961 crore) among others were among the most active stocks on NSE in value terms. Higher activity on a counter in value terms can help identify the counters with the highest trading turnovers in the day.

Coal India (Shares traded: 2.8 crore), Tata Steel (Shares traded: 2.7 crore), ONGC (Shares traded: 2.1 crore), ICICI Bank (Shares traded: 1.6 crore), SBI (Shares traded: 1.5 crore), HDFC Bank (Shares traded: 1.4 crore), and Tata Motors (Shares traded: 1.3 crore), among others were among the most traded stocks in the session on NSE.

Shares of Divis Labs, Sun Pharma, Coal India, Cipla, Tata Consumer Products, Apollo Hospital, and Power Grid Corp among others witnessed strong buying interest from market participants as they scaled their fresh 52-week highs, signaling bullish sentiment.

No major stock hit its 52-week low on Tuesday.

Overall, market breadth favoured bulls as 1,906 stocks ended in the green, while 1,904 names settled in the red."

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/manipur-shootout-rpf-claims-self-defence-after-four-civilians-killed-eight-injured/articleshow/106492724.cms,"Guwahati: Proscribed armed outfit of Manipur, Revolutionary Peoples’ Front (RPF), stated that shootout in Lilong, resulting in the loss of four innocent lives and injuring eight others was in self-defence.

Chief minister N Biren Singh warned that these elements should be held responsible, if the government takes any stringent action including reimposition of the unwanted AFSPA.

On Monday four people were shot dead, and injuring others injured in Manipur’s Thoubal district. Curfew was reimposed in the three districts of the state.

The RPF clarified their mission was an attempt to apprehend a drug lord who had persistently flouted warnings to halt illegal drug trading which the locals of the area intervened without understanding the mission, resulting in the shootout in self-defence.

Police reports, registered under FIR No. 01(01)2023LIL-PS u/s 302/435/34IPC, 20UA(P) A. Act & 25(1-C) Arms Act, detailed the sequence of events. Armed miscreants in four Maruti Gypsies opened fire in the localities of Lilong Tamyai and Chingjao, near Md. Hassan’s residence, while allegedly attempting to abduct him. When locals intervened to prevent the abduction, the armed group resorted to firing, resulting in casualties and injuries. The miscreants fled on foot, abandoning their vehicles which were later set ablaze by enraged locals.

The victims, all from financially disadvantaged backgrounds, leave behind shattered families. Makakmayum Sophia, daughter of one victim, M Azad (44) recounted the tragic moment her father left home to search for her missing brothers, never to return.

“We were having dinner last night at around 7 pm when we heard the commotion. My father realized my younger brothers had not returned home. So, he got worried and despite my request not to go out, he went out not to come back,” sobs a soft-spoken Sophia.

Amidst the grief, concerns arose over potential ethnic clashes between the Muslim and Meitei communities. Civil society organizations from both sides condemned the incident, urging for justice and restraint to prevent communal tensions from escalating.

Md. Jakaria, a research scholar at Manipur University, sought to quell communal tones, attributing the mayhem to an extortion-related issue involving armed miscreants. He emphasized the absence of underlying tension between the Muslim and Meitei communities.

The RPF, while regretting the civilian casualties, maintained their stance, asserting that the unfortunate incident occurred during their attempt to discipline the alleged drug lord, Md. Hassan. They claimed local intervention led to a defensive retaliation resulting in fatalities and injuries, expressing remorse for the outcome.

Monday’s firing, which could spark abrupt communal flare up, was proficiently handled by the N Biren Singh government to ease tension, with the sudden clamping of total curfew in all valley districts in addition to his public statement appealing to remain calm. The timely intervention of civil society organisations into the incident is also a big force to subside the highly charged tension.

Meanwhile, Biren Singh, who visited the injured at the private hospital , questioned the rationality in inciting hatred and fighting among the people instead of unitedly facing those who are trying hard to break the state apart.

Reiterating his stance to come out strongly against anyone taking the law into their own hands, he said that the government will not remain silent and take actions against anyone taking the law into their own hands.

“These elements should be held responsible, if the government takes any stringent action including reimposition of the unwanted AFSPA,” added Biren, who also visited the victims’ families.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/oppenheimer-when-will-it-begin-streaming-on-peacock/articleshow/106492396.cms,"After Christopher Nolan's latest blockbuster, 'Oppenheimer', dominated theaters throughout mid and late-summer 2023, fans are waiting for its streaming run on Peacock. Nolan became one of 2023's biggest names for his work on Oppenheimer. It became his third-highest-grossing movie ever and the third-biggest movie of 2023 at the box office behind 'Barbie' and 'The Super Mario Bros. Movie'. Nolan's World War II biopic is the lone outlier still only available to view on the big screen.

Though 'Oppenheimer' made its theatrical debut on July 14, 2023, the film still does not have an official update on when it will be available for streaming on Peacock.

January 2024?
Though Peacock released its January 2024 slate of streaming projects, the list did not include Christopher Nolan's 2023 blockbuster. Peacock has historically added movies to its monthly slate later that weren't previously slated. There is a possibility that 'Oppenheimer' could come to Peacock sometime in January, it is not likely to arrive in 2024. But if it happens, 'Oppenheimer' may arrive later in January or sometime in early February.

Oscar nominations
The Oscar nominations will be announced on January 23, 2024. So, Universal may also be looking to time Oppenheimer's streaming debut date closer to this date so that Nolan's film may get plenty of consideration across multiple awards categories.

As the studio is still collecting money from digital sales nearly half a year after 'Oppenheimer' hit theaters, the studio is most likely to use any method to earn as much financial success as possible from its biggest hit of 2023.

Oppenheimer is currently playing in theaters and it does not have an official streaming release date.

Oppenheimer
'Oppenheimer' is a 2023 epic biographical thriller, written and directed by Christopher Nolan. It stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist credited with being the 'father of the atomic bomb' for his role in the Manhattan Project—the World War II undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons. Based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles the career of Oppenheimer.

FAQs:
When was 'Oppenheimer' released to theaters?

The interior ministry informed the Senate, the upper house of parliament, that those sent back were about one third of all unlawful immigrants living in the country,

A written reply was submitted to the Senate by the ministry in response to a question by Senator Mohsin Aziz on the number of illegal residents in the country as well as the number of those deported.

The ministry said that around 1.7 million ""illegal aliens"" are unlawfully living in the country, the majority of whom are Afghans, who are living without any legal documentation necessary for staying in the country.

It further said that ""541,210 people have been sent back after the cabinet's approval of the deportation plan for illegal residents.""

It added that nearly 1.15 million illegal aliens were still living in the country and continuous efforts were under way to identify and deport the remaining people.

It also said that 271,985 people were repatriated through the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and another 159,161 through Balochistan province. Both provinces share a border with Afghanistan.

It added that according to data from other systems such as the Integrated Border Management System, a further 110,064 had also left the country.

The government in October issued an ultimatum to all undocumented immigrants to leave Pakistan by Oct 31 and warned to launch a crackdown from Nov 1 against those who failed to follow those directives.

As the deadline ended, the government began a campaign to expel illegal foreign nationals.

As the majority of the illegal residents came from Afghanistan, the interim government in Kabul tried to get the orders reversed but without any success. Besides the Afghan government, the human rights bodies also criticized the government.

However, the government insisted that Afghan nationals were involved in terrorist activities and it was essential for the national security to expel the illegal residents and those interested to come back should come through legal channels.

Maheshwari Datamatics Pvt Ltd (MDPL) is a Sebi-registered Registrar to an issue and Share Transfer Agent (RTA).

The order came after the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) conducted an inspection of MDPL for the period from April 2021 to November 2022.

After the inspection, Sebi initiated the adjudication proceedings against Maheshwari Datamatics for violating the market rules.

In its order passed on December 29, Sebi found Radhey Shyam Jhanwar was an associate person of MDPL during the inspection period and hence was required to possess the National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM) certification.

Under the Sebi rules, the markets watchdog has laid down the specific procedural requirements regarding the certification of an associate person, and these requirements must be adhered to.

However, MDPL had failed to ensure that its associated person has completed the mandatory NISM certification, thereby violating the RTA rules.

""I note that penalties have been imposed by Sebi on the noticee earlier for similar violations. Such repetitive violations by the noticee show that it had not given sufficient attention to the deficiencies pointed out in the earlier inspections,"" Sebi's Adjudicating Officer N Hariharan said in the order.

The regulator also found that there is no finding on record to show that the activities of the noticee have caused loss to any client or have impacted the securities market in any manner.

However, the regulator noted that there can be no dispute regarding delay in processing of requests by investors within the prescribed timelines which have affected the genuine rights of investors, as per Sebi.

In a separate order, the markets watchdog imposed a penalty of Rs 6 lakh on Capital Grow Financial Services (Proprietor Prashant Gole) for violating market rules.

The order came after the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) in its ruling had set aside Sebi's order passed in January 2023 and remitted the matter back to the regulator and directed it to pass a fresh order.

Rural Development Minister Giriraj Singh said both Hindus and Muslims in India have the ""same DNA"", and urged Hindu youths to pledge that no attacker will be able to harm the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.

He was reacting to Owaisi's reported remarks where, while referring to Babri mosque, the AIMIM asked the Muslim youths if they don't feel the pain that ""the place where we sat and recited the Quran for 500 years is not in our hands today"".

""Young people, don't you see that a conspiracy is taking place regarding three- four more mosques, in which the Sunheri Masjid (Golden Mosque) of Delhi is also included? After years of hard work, we have achieved our position today....

""It should not happen that our mosques are snatched away from us...,"" he said in his address at an event whose video was posted on X by his party AIMIM on Monday.

Reacting to the post, BJP's Information and Technology head Amit Malviya accused Owaisi of communalising the consecration of Ram Mandir.

""Asaduddin Owaisi is doing what he does best, communalising the consecration of Ram Mandir.

""In 2020, two Mosques in Hyderabad, Masjid-e-Mohammadi and Masjid-e-Hashmi were demolished to build the Secretariat but Owaisi, who is Member of Parliament from the city, didn't utter a word,"" Malviya said.

BJP leader Giriraj Singh likened Owaisi to Pakistan found M A Jinnah.

""In 1947, Jinnah left India on August 15, but the ghost of Jinnah remained in India, and it entered people like Owaisi,"" Singh said.

""Owaisi is provoking the youth of the country that your mosques are going,"" Singh said.

""Lord Ram is the identity of India, there are no sons of Babur in this country. Our DNA is the same. One may convert but our ancestors remain the same,"" Singh said.

Singh said Lord Ram belongs to everyone.

""It will be the day of renaissance in India. I want to tell Hindu youths, on January 22, light five earthen lamps and pledge that no Ghazni, Babur or Aurangzeb can even look at the Ram temple, and if they do, respond to them like Maharana Pratap,"" Singh said.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/uk/mo-salahs-penalty-woes-continue-despite-milestone-goal/articleshow/106492071.cms,"Liverpool's clash with Newcastle witnessed a pivotal moment as Mohamed Salah endured another penalty miss, extending his recent struggles from the spot. The match at Anfield saw controversy arise when Luis Diaz was fouled, leading to a penalty awarded to the Reds.

Despite Salah's remarkable goal tally this season, he faltered, aiming his shot straight at Martin Dubravka, who easily parried it away. This miss marks Salah's fourth failure from his last ten penalties, further highlighting a concerning trend.

Attempting to unravel Salah's uncharacteristic error, former Manchester United defender Gary Neville expressed surprise at the Egyptian forward's hurried approach. Neville, speaking on Sky Sports, pointed out Salah's perceived desperation, questioning both the rushed nature of the penalty and Trent Alexander-Arnold's failure to capitalize on the rebound opportunity.

Neville pondered whether Liverpool might consider an alternative penalty taker, a decision that could potentially unsettle Salah despite his outstanding abilities on the field.

However, Salah quickly brushed off any dismay by opening the scoring post-halftime, reaching a significant milestone of 150 Premier League goals. Yet, discussions might ensue within Liverpool's camp regarding penalty duties, considering Salah hasn't always been their primary penalty taker.

In a previous conversation with Liverpool icon Steven Gerrard, Salah revealed his initiation into penalty-taking, citing a specific instance involving Harry Kane's goal tally. Despite his knack for finding the net, Salah confessed his aversion to taking penalties, expressing a dislike for the pressure and feeling associated with spot-kicks.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/knives-out-3-release-cast-and-everything-else-you-should-know/articleshow/106491643.cms,"Fans are eagerly waiting for the release of 'Knives Out 3', Rian Johnson's take on the murder mystery genre. After a stellar box office performance, grossing $312.9 million worldwide, Johnson signed a $450 million deal with Netflix for two 'Knives Out' sequels. The first of which 'Glass Onion' was released in 2022. The second is on the anvil. Casting Daniel Craig as detective Benoit Blanc, along with talented actors like Ana De Armas, Chris Evans, and Dave Bautista, Johnson seemingly has stars lined up to be a part of Clue-like ensembles.

'Knives Out 3' Release
The fans have been waiting, but an exact release date has not been decided because 'Knives Out 3' is still in the works. It will be the final movie under Rian Johnson's current deal with Netflix which promised two Knives Out sequels.

Talking to Variety, Johnson confirmed that he had ""started work on the third movie."" He said, ""They felt like the most entertaining thing in the world. And we make these movies as entertainment first and foremost. What was exciting about doing [‘Glass Onion’] was the notion of trying to emulate Christie with a completely new story.""

He added, ""I’m starting to work on the third movie now, and that’s also what’s got me creatively jazzed: I don’t have to replicate the last movie at all. The goal is to strike out in a completely new direction tonally and thematically.""

Release date
Considering that 'Knives Out' came out in 2020 and 'Glass Onion' three years later in 2022, it seems likely that 'Knives Out 3' will hit Netflix sometime in late 2025. According to the co-head of the streamer's original studio film group Ori Marmur, Rian Johnson is already working on the third one, but there’s no set timetable. He said further that he would love to have it sooner rather than later given the response to the last one.

Cast
The only confirmed character for 'Knives Out 3' is the series protagonist, Detective Benoit Blanc, portrayed by Daniel Craig. The eccentric inspector has been the only constant seen throughout the two movies thus far in the franchise, and that seems to be intentional.

Assam director general of police stated in X, “The review BMI testing for the 1884 police personnel has started at Jorhat, Silchar and Guwahati.”

Earlier he had stated, “As a follow up to BMI testing in August 2023, the re-examination of 1884 @assampolice personnel who fell in Obese category (30+ BMI) would start at Guwahati, Silchar and Jorhat from January 2nd 2024. Hope most of them have shaped up in the three months period given. We remain committed to provide the people of Assam a professional and fit Police Unit.”

In August last year, started a for the 67,000-strong force. Assam Director General of police GP Singh also took up for the fitness test last year .The BMI tests are being conducted in as many as 36 locations across the state.

Those found unfit will be given three months to shape up. A test will be done at the end of three months. If they fail again, they will be made to take voluntary .

""We have decided to make Assam police fitter and healthy. First port of call is checking BMI. After the results are out, those found obese will have to come to a police training college where the doctor will help them. We will make a similar data base for blood sugar and pressure.""

In May last year Assam police decided to get rid of deadwood from the police force.

Singh earlier had stated in X, “ In line with directions of the Hon @CMOfficeAssam @assampolice Hq has decided to go in for professional recording of Body Mass Index (BMI) of all Assam Police personnel including IPS/APS officers and all DEF/Bn/Organisations. We plan to give three months' time to all Assam Police personnel including IPS & APS officers till August 15th and then start BMI assessment in the next fifteen days.

Earlier the DGP had stated that there are around 680 personnel who are purportedly habitual drinkers or obese, and those among them found unfit for duty will be offered voluntary retirement after a thorough review.

On May 8 the DGP had stated, “We already have a list of about 680 persons. To ensure that no name is added without a logical basis, we have formed committees in battalions and districts, which will be headed by a deputy commandant or an additional SP-rank officer.”

Assam chief minister in a virtual conferencing with senior officials of the Assam Police and SPs of districts instructed the police top brass to cut the dead wood out of the police force - those who are habitual drinkers, excessively obese, and having corruption cases against them - by giving them either VRS or CRS compensation."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/india-womens-suffer-third-heaviest-odi-defeat-by-190-runs-rampant-australia-complete-3-0-whitewash/articleshow/106492340.cms,"India produced an abject batting display after a poor show with the ball to suffer a 190-run loss, their third heaviest defeat, in the third and final ODI as a rampant Australia completed a 3-0 series whitewash here on Tuesday. Having conceded the highest total ever of 338/7 recorded by any opposition against them, India's frailties with the bat came to the fore as they were shot out for 148 in 32.4 overs.

None of the Indian batters, who had put up a strong fight in the second ODI here at the Wankhede Stadium, could make a dent in the opposition's march to a 10th consecutive win in away bilateral games.

For Australia, it is their ninth series win against India and fifth in the opponent's backyard.

Australia have beaten India in India 3-0 in 2018, 3-0 in 2012 and 4-0 in 1984. India have also suffered 0-3 whitewash in 2006 and 0-5 clean sweep in 2008 in Australia.

India were rocked twice in the powerplay when Megan Schutt (2/23) cleaned up Yastika Bhatia (6) and then Smriti Mandhana (29) played one straight down the throat of Kim Garth at deep extra cover.

India's plight deepened when skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (3) was dismissed for her third single-digit score in a row.

Looking to sweep Georgia Wareham (3/21), Harmanpreet was beaten by Beth Mooney's anticipation to quickly move on her left from the first slip to complete the dismissal.

Richa Ghosh (19), coming off a superb 96 in the second ODI, played on to her wickets off Wareham with the Australian leg-spinner once again snaffling crucial wickets.

India's hopes to take the game deep then suffered a body blow in the 20th over when their most consistent batter in the series Jemimah Rodrigues (25) smashed one straight to Alana King at short midwicket off Ashleigh Gardner.

But the highlight for Australia in the second innings was Phoebe Litchfield's stunning one-handed catch. She flew on her right to complete a diving effort at cover, to dismiss Amanjot Kaur (3) off King.

King (2/21) then produced the ball of the series when she bamboozled Pooja Vastrakar (14) to get one turning from leg stump to hit the top of off.

Annabel Sutherland also chipped in with a measly 3-0-9-2.

Earlier, Litchfield continued her rich vein of form with a magnificent century as Australia Women flayed India.

Litchfield cracked as many as 16 fours and a six to make 119 off 125 balls and put on a record 189-run stand for the first wicket with Alyssa Healy, who also cashed in on the opportunity with an 85-ball 82 (4x4s, 3x6s).

Australia were relentless with the bat from the word go and despite Shreyanka Patil's 3/57, the visitors made merry on a placid wicket that proved to be a batting haven.

Litchfield and Healy's 189-run stand is now the highest for any wicket among all the visiting sides in India in the 50-overs format, bettering South Africans Lizelle Lee and Laura Wolvaardt's 169-run partnership for the first wicket in 2021.

Having possibly missed out on making tons in each of the first two ODIs with scores of 78 and 63, Litchfield showcased her rich arsenal of strokes all around the park to flatten India.

Litchfield, however, was also lucky when Deepti Sharma could not hold onto a tough diving catch to her left, off Amanjot Kaur (10-0-70-2) in the 19th over, when the batter was on 62.

If it was any consolation, Deepti had Litchfield caught by Harmanpreet and with that the right-arm spinner became only the fourth Indian to have taken 100 wickets in one-day cricket.

Patil was the most successful Indian bowlers with 3 for 57 in her 10-over spell, with her twin strikes in the 36th over providing some respite on a tough day out.

Patil trapped Mooney (3) and Tahlia McGrath (0) leg-before on consecutive deliveries to peg Australia back, albeit momentarily, as the visitors' aggressive approach again brought them back on top.

Gardner's 27-ball 30 with four fours, Sutherland's 21-ball 23 (2x4s, 1x6s) and late fireworks yet again from King - 26 not out off 14 balls, three sixes, one four - helped Australia better their own record.

King took 19 runs off Vastrakar's final over as Australia bettered their own record for highest-ever total against India in ODIs. Australia had made 332/7 in March 2018 at Vadodara.

Apart from a slew of misfields and dropped catches, Indian team was also guilty of conceding 28 extras, which gave further push to the visitor's massive total.

Having spilled as many as seven catches in the last game, India's fielding certainly did not seem to have improved a great deal when Mandhana spilled a sitter at deep midwicket to give Ellyse Perry a reprieve.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/fuel-supply-hit-due-to-truckers-strike-bunks-turn-away-customers-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/106490229.cms,"The truckers' strike, a stir by drivers against the new law on hit-and-run cases, has created ruckus across India for a couple of days now. While, the Union Home Secretary was scheduled to meet the protesting truckers in the evening of January 2, the protests are anticipated to continue even on Wednesday.

The on-going protests have caused heavy traffic jams on the highways, long queues at fuel stations in several states and a panic situation among the people.

As per the chairman of the All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) President, Amritlal Madan, almost 60-70 per cent of all trucks are not on the roads right now due to the ongoing strike.

Why are the truckers protesting?
The provisions under the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS), which state that a driver who causes a serious road accident through negligent driving and flees without reporting the incident to the police or any administration official will face up to 10 years in prison or a fine of Rs 7 lakh, triggered strikes among the truck drivers.

The new law superseded the Indian Penal Code of the colonial era, in which the penalty for such hit and run cases was two years.

— PTI_News (@PTI_News)

Which states are witnessing the protests?
The drivers are demonstrating strikes in some states, including Maharashtra, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.

The proteststurned violent in the Kekri district of the desert state where a mob burnt a police vehicle and pelted stones at security personnel, leaving three injured, PTI reported.

Maharashtra, the truck drivers have been staging protests at various places, including capital Mumbai, Nagpur, Solapur, Dharashiv, Navi Mumbai, Palghar, Nagpur, Beed, Hingoli, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Nashik, Gadchiroli and Wardha.

However, in a positive development, truck drivers have called off their strike in Maharashtra's Nashik district after the local authorities assured to look into their demands.

Petrol bunks run dry in these states
As the strike by some truckers' associations entered the second day, nearly 2,000 petrol pumps, mostly in western and northern India, have run out of fuel stocks, news agency PTI reported.

While most petrol stations nationwide had their tanks topped off by state-owned oil companies ahead of the truckers' strike, some petrol stations in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Punjab ran out of stock because of high demand.

Most petrol pumps in Himachal Pradesh's Dharamshala, Kullu-Manali, Bilaspur, Hamirpur, Chamba, Una and Shimla were turning away customers, while massive queues were seen outside the ones still in operation.

Motorists queued up at fuel stations at many places in Punjab, Haryana and their common capital creating a panic situation.

Chandigarh has also imposed restrictions on the sale of petrol and diesel at fuel stations. ""Effective immediately, two-wheelers are limited to a maximum of 2 litres (maximum value of Rs 200) and four-wheelers are limited to 5 litres (maximum value of Rs 500) of fuel per transaction,"" the Chandigarh administration said.

In Haryana's Ambala, some petrol stations have already reported a shortage of petrol and diesel as no fresh supply has been received in the last two days, PTI reported.

Huge crowds were also seen at petrol pumps in Bhopal, Indore and other cities on Tuesday morning to refuel their vehicle tanks amid the drivers' agitation.

Some people claimed they could not get their vehicles refuelled as petrol pumps ran dry. PTI further reported.

Meanwhile, situation in southern India is better with no major supply disruption barring a few pumps in Hyderabad.

Hit-and-run law: AIMTC Chairman says 'situation is critical, drivers are burning licenses…'
As transport associations and drivers are protesting against the new law on hit-and-run cases, Chairman Core Committee of All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) Bal Malkit Singh on Jan 02 said that the situation is critical. Bal Malkit Singh, “There is a spontaneous reaction in the country to the hit-and-run law. We've never seen such kind of a protest...Drivers are burning their licenses and papers. The situation is very serious. We are trying to defuse the fire and appeal the same to the government. We also appeal to the drivers to be patient & will take their concerns to the government.”


What are the protestors saying
The umbrella body of truckers nationwide, AIMTC, wants the government to withdraw the provisions claiming these being ""onerous"" and will create hardship for drivers.

""The government must withdraw the provisions relating to hit- and run cases in the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita,"" AIMTC President Amritlal Madan said while addressing reporters.

He further said that the truckers association will decide on the future course of action after meeting with the Union home secretary in the evening.

AIMTC Chairman-organising committee Bal Mankit Singh urged the government not to drag the issue for long as was done in the case of the Farmers law.

He regretted that the government did not consult with the stakeholders.

Government stand
General VK Singh (Retd), Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways said that the new laws have been made to alert the vehicle drivers and for the safety of the passengers.

""Passengers should not face problems. The new law has been devised to help the passengers. Earlier drivers used to run away, now a new law has been made to alert the drivers and for the safety of the passengers,"" VK Singh told ANI.

Further, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla is meeting protesting truckers in the evening amid a stir by drivers against the new law on hit-and-run cases, and the issue is likely to be resolved amicably, PTI reported citing sources.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/cars-uvs/indias-record-car-sales-in-2023-heres-a-look-under-the-hood/articleshow/106485837.cms,"India’s passenger vehicle market, valued at Rs 4.5 lakh crore, has been outpacing volume growth. It has just passed a milestone as annual volumes of cars, sedans and utility vehicles breached the four million mark for the first time in 2023. As per industry estimates, about 4.1 million passenger vehicles were sold in the local market in the last calendar year, an increase of around 8.2% compared with sales of 3.79 million units in 2022.

What's behind the spike?

The pandemic depressed the passenger vehicle market across the world. India emerged as the fastest-growing automobile market for a key reason. Semiconductor chips, important components for cars, went scarce due to the pandemic disrupting supply chains. And when the pandemic effect started waning, there was a big scramble for those chips. India was able to produce cars faster than other major markets because its cars have fewer chips.

But the major factor behind the record car sales in the last calendar year is the positive macro factors in the world's fastest-growing major economy. Higher disposable incomes, growth of the middle class, better and more roads and highways, a propensity to travel more, and the pent-up demand from the pandemic have been accelerating India's car market. Indians' new-found craze for sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and a wider adoption of electric vehicles spearheaded the record sales last year.

“The PV industry is expected to (have) posted its highest ever sales in the calendar year 2023 (CY23), crossing the significant 4 million mark, supported by a strong supply situation, new nameplates launched in the SUV segment, and a robust demand during the longer festive period. Coming off a high base, the industry recorded a single-digit growth overall with the key highlight of this moderate rise being the sharp growth registered in emission-friendly product categories. Both EV and CNG segments posted growth greater than 90% and 25% respectively, signaling a growing preference for green and smart technologies by Indian customers,” Shailesh Chandra, Managing Director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, told ET recently.

The road ahead in 2024

Overall, carmakers expect demand momentum in the market to remain strong in 2024 as the economy is expected to continue doing well. But sales are likely to go up in single-digits, on a high base. Drying of pent-up demand might impact sales and so can high interest rates that make the car loans expensive.

On the other hand, a large number of new launches will boost sales. More than two dozen new car models, including EVs, will be unveiled or go on sale in 2024, ET has reported. This will be the highest number of new model introductions in the non-luxury segment in the last few years. Besides EVs, these will include facelifts of existing models. A spate of new SUVs and EVs will surely attract more buyers.

New launches typically add 8-10% of total volume growth for automakers, potentially translating into 250,000-300,000 units of incremental volume, taking the domestic aggregate to a record 4.3-4.4 million units next year, ET has reported. That would make 2024 the third straight year of record annual sales volume for passenger vehicles.

Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) Director General Rajesh Menon told PTI that the sales outlook remained positive for the industry going into next year. ""The overall outlook for the Indian automobile industry in 2024 looks good which can be attributed to the all-round economic growth of the country, which is also enabled with the conducive policy environment of the government,"" he said.

Varied arenas, spanning from educational institutions to healthcare networks, family-driven foundations, and advocates for equitable causes, reaped the bounties of this exceptional wave of altruism.

Steering this altruistic wave was Warren Buffett, the esteemed maestro of investments. With an estimated wealth orbiting around $119 billion, Buffett left an indelible mark by bestowing a remarkable gift—1.5 million shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class “B” stock, valued at a staggering $541.5 million—to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, an homage to his late first wife. Tracing its roots to 1964, this family-driven foundation, with active participation from two of Buffett's offspring, champions primarily the advancement of women’s reproductive health and fosters the educational ambitions of aspiring students in Nebraska through scholarships.

Marching in harmony with Buffett’s philanthropic ethos, James Simons, a luminary in mathematics and founder of a hedge fund, together with his partner Marilyn, pledged an awe-inspiring $500 million through their Simons Foundation to the State University of New York at Stony Brook. This monumental contribution aims to fortify the university’s financial base and enrich various facets of academia, accentuating scholarships, faculty positions, an array of research pursuits, and bolstered clinical care.

Another standout contributor, Ross Brown, the visionary founder of Cryogenic Industries, pledged a remarkable $400 million to the California Institute of Technology. This substantial donation, channeled through his family foundation and a donor-advised fund, will seed the creation of the Brown Institute for Basic Sciences. The institute’s mandate encompasses catalyzing scientific research across multiple universities while spearheading the prestigious Ross Brown Investigators Award Program, a significant initiative backing midcareer faculty engaged in groundbreaking chemistry and physics research.

Phil Knight, co-founder of Nike, and his wife, Penny, joined this chorus of benefactors with a monumental $400 million pledge to the 1803 Fund, dedicated to revitalizing Albina, a historic enclave in Portland, Oregon. This restoration endeavor aims to uplift communities impacted by historical injustices, offering educational programs, cultural restoration projects, and economic revitalization initiatives.

In the healthcare arena, Daniel and Jennifer Gilbert made a transformative $375 million contribution through their Gilbert Family Foundation to Henry Ford Health. Their generous endowment aims to establish two medical centers—a specialized rehabilitation center in Detroit catering to patients recovering from various conditions, and the Nick Gilbert Neurofibromatosis Research Institute, dedicated to seeking a cure for neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder.

Concluding this symphony of benevolence, Kenneth Griffin, through his charitable fund, bestowed $300 million to Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, predominantly empowering financial aid programs for undergraduates.

The philanthropic tapestry of 2023 showcases these remarkable acts of giving, underscoring a year marked by extraordinary generosity. These significant contributions not only spotlight the benevolence of these individuals but also mirror a broader landscape of impactful philanthropy aimed at shaping a better society. As we await The Chronicle’s comprehensive ranking of the 50 biggest donors in March, these philanthropic endeavors serve as a testament to the enduring spirit of giving and the profound impact it continues to wield in transforming lives and communities.

Here's a comprehensive look at what we know about the film, from release dates to the talented ensemble.

Release Date Shuffle:
Initially slated for a September 2023 release, ""Challengers"" faced a delay due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, eventually securing its spot on the cinematic calendar with an April 26, 2024, release date, as reported by Deadline. This places the film amid a bustling April, sharing the month with other highly anticipated releases like M. Night Shyamalan's ""The First Omen"" and an A24 production titled ""Civil War.""

Plot Unveiled:
""Challengers"" isn't your average sports drama; it dives deep into the world of tennis, weaving together competition, drama, and a touch of romance. The MGM official synopsis introduces Tashi, a rising tennis star whose career takes an unexpected turn due to an injury. Transitioning from player to coach, Tashi guides her husband, Art, in his pursuit of becoming a Grand Slam champion. The plot takes a dramatic twist as Art, facing a slump, enters a ""Challenger"" event – a competition described as close to the ""lowest level"" of professional play. The stakes skyrocket as he is pitted against his former best friend and Tashi's ex-lover.

Stellar Cast:
At the film's forefront is Zendaya, marking her prominent role in a sports drama. Joining her are Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist, as confirmed by Deadline in February 2022. Zendaya, celebrated for her role in ""Euphoria"" and her impactful presence in films like ""Dune: Part 1"" and the Spider-Man franchise, steps into the character of Tashi. Josh O'Connor, known for his work in ""The Crown"" and ""Emma,"" takes on the role of Art, while Mike Faist, recognized for his part in ""West Side Story,"" portrays Patrick.

Adding to the ensemble is Jake Jensen, set to make his film debut in ""Challengers,"" as confirmed by Distract T.V. in August 2023. With Zendaya leading this talented cast, expectations are high for a compelling and emotionally charged sports narrative.

FAQs:
Is Challengers based on a true story?
In Guadagnino's inaugural foray into comedy, ""Challengers,"" the storyline is not drawn from real-life events. During an interview with IndieWire at the Provincetown Film Festival in October 2022, he characterized the fictional tennis narrative as ""beautifully complex"" and dubbed the film ""a notably lively, sensuous exploration of the tennis world.""

Can Zendaya play tennis?
Zendaya's on-screen tennis prowess in the movie is no just a product of CGI, according to director Guadagnino, as he revealed to Variety last year. The actress dedicated three months to rigorous training under the guidance of former professional tennis player Brad Gilbert, who also contributed as a consultant on the set of ""Challengers.""

Industrial undertakings exempt from the requirements of licensing under The Industries (Development and Regulation) Act 1951 are required to file information related to setting up of industries, which is known as IEM. Confirmation for receipt of such information by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is known as ‘IEM Acknowledgement’.

In an office memorandum, the DPIIT said that for cancellation of IEM acknowledgements, the firm concerned has to give a request letter on company’s letter head signed by authorised officer giving specific reasons for cancellation, along with the copy of original IEM.

The department said that it was receiving several applications from companies requesting for amendments, cancellation and issuance of duplicate IEM.

“In this regard, the requests have been considered and it is decided that the... standard operating procedure will be adopted for these purposes,” the DPIIT said in the memorandum.

“Cancellation letter will be issued after approval of concerned AS (additional secretary)/JS (joint secretary),” it said.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/several-grapplers-seek-uww-intervention-in-resolving-wrestling-crisis-in-india/articleshow/106492098.cms,"New Delhi, Several international medal-winning wrestlers from different states have approached the world governing body UWW, requesting its intervention for restoration of the suspended WFI and accused Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat and Sakshi Malik of orchestrating a ""fake agitation"".

The three wrestlers had led a protest against former WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, alleging that he has sexually exploited women wrestlers and sought his arrest.

The matter is being heard by a Delhi court and Brij Bhushan is out on bail.

The National camps have not been held for a long time due to the ongoing tussle between the elite wrestlers and the BJP MP. An ad-hoc panel ran the sport till recently but was brought back to handle day-to-day affairs of the sports body after the newly-elected body was suspended by the Sports Ministry.

""I would like to inform you that due to fake agitation of three wrestlers, the wrestling in India has been destroyed. I am a woman wrestler but I did not face any sexual demand from the previous president,"" wrote an Asian Games and CWG medal-winning wrestler.

""I thought after the election of WFI, this controversy will be over but these three wrestlers are trying to damage wrestling in India. Being a woman wrestler, I personally contacted many women wrestlers but no one corroborated the version of these wrestlers.

""My humble request to UWW is to interfere in the matter and a permanent Federation may please be established in India otherwise wrestling will be destroyed,"" the Arjuna awardee added.

It may be mentioned that United World Wrestling (UWW) had suspended the WFI on August 24 for not holding elections on time and Indian wrestlers had to compete as neutral athletes at the World Championships last year.

A junior wrestler from Maharashtra, in her letter to UWW President Nenad Lalovic, wrote how their careers have been stalled in the absence of junior national championships.

""Since two years, there is no sub junior and junior competition, the wrestlers are not getting the chance to show their talent as there are only three senior players (creating controversy) and on top of that due to politics, a big crisis has come...... Please give justice to Indian wrestlers by activating Wrestling Federation of India,"" the wrestler wrote.

The newly elected body WFI had announced immediately after the polls that U15 and U20 Nationals will be held in the last week of December in Gonda, UP but due to WFI suspension, the competitions could not be held.

Interestingly, the minor who filed a sexual harassment complaint against Brij Bhushan before withdrawing it, also wrote to the UWW admitting that her father filed a fake complaint against the former WFI boss.

She even said that she did it under the influence of Punia, Phogat and Malik.

""This was all fake. Nothing happened to me. I came under pressure from the top three wrestlers but I did not know what they really wanted from me.

""When I came to know that they had filed a fake complaint through my father, I immediately refuted it and appeared in the court and accepted that nothing happened to me. Now I understand that these three wrestlers are ruining the careers of all the wrestlers.

""I am an innocent female wrestler, I could not understand the conspiracy. I am feeling guilty now and request you to kindly take note of this. I don't want that wrestling goes down in India.""

Several other wrestlers alleged that now that there is nothing left in the careers of Punia, Malik and Phogat, they can afford to be involved in controversies but due to their actions, careers of others are getting impacted adversely.

Mandaviya laid the foundation stone of the NCDC regional branch in Assam and six state branches in Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Odisha, West Bengal and Mizoram, and BSL-3 labs in Himachal Pradesh and Jharkhand virtually from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) here.

He also inaugurated a temporary NCDC regional branch in Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh. These new NCDC branches and BSL-3 labs will strengthen the country's capacity for pandemic preparedness and disease surveillance with ""One Health"" approach.

Mandaviya said that these regional branches of NCDC will help in combating diseases with regional variations such as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) and scrub typhus.

Further, state branches of NCDC and BSL-3 laboratory once functional will augment the capacity of region/state for preparedness and response especially for outbreak-prone diseases by high-risk pathogens, he said.

""The health infrastructure facilities inaugurated today, or for those whose foundation stone has been laid, will substantially boost our regional, district and block level healthcare infrastructure and will further augment the surveillance, diagnostics and public health preparedness and response capacity for any impending outbreak or pandemic in future,"" he said.

""Pandemic preparedness and disease surveillance anchored in strong health systems that reach all people, especially the most vulnerable, are crucial to ensure better protection from major disease outbreaks,"" he said.

Emphasizing that these institutions under NCDC will be in the interest of the local populace, he stated that the government is committed towards strengthening the surveillance of infectious diseases and outbreak response through strengthening of NCDC.

India has performed better than many other countries in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, Mandaviya said.

The NCDC has been at the forefront in instituting containment measures, including community surveillance, contact tracing and response in coordination with state and local governments.

He said NCDC is the nodal agency for public health surveillance and response, epidemiological support including outbreak investigations in addition to diagnostic capacities for bacterial, viral, zoonotic infections and parasitic diseases.

""Healthcare professionals and practitioners are like defence forces, they can never be in a complacent mood. They have to always be on alert. There can be no lean period for our healthcare army, we have to strengthen and sharpen our skills for timely surveillance and disease detection,"" the minister said.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/will-penalise-states-not-mgnrega-workers-if-not-linked-with-aadhaar-based-payment-system-minister-giriraj-singh/articleshow/106491984.cms,"Rural Development Minister Giriraj Singh Tuesday slammed the Congress for its criticism of making Aadhaar mandatory for payments under MGNREGA, and said ""we will penalise states not workers"" if they are not yet linked with the Aadhaar-Based Payment System (ABPS). A day after the ABPS was made mandatory for the rural employment guarantee scheme, Singh said several deadlines were given for linking.

He also dismissed former rural development minister Jairam Ramesh's allegations that the union government is ""weaponising technology"", especially the Aadhaar against the poor.

The ABPS has been made mandatory to ensure transparency, the minister said.

According to data provided by the Rural Development Ministry, as on January 2 there are around 14.32 crore active workers under the MGNREGS of whom 14.08 crore (98.31 per cent) have been Aadhaar-seeded.

Also, 12.54 crore workers (87.54 per cent of the total) have completed other steps and are currently eligible for Aadhaar-Based Payment System.

Asked about the way ahead for those workers under MGNREGA who have still not been linked to ABPS, Singh said, ""We will talk to states. If they raise concerns we will see what can be the way forward.""

""We have extended the deadline multiple times over the last one year, now we will talk to states, what is the issue, how will they resolve it... We will penalise states, not the workers,"" the minister said.

The minister said the ""road is not closed"" for workers yet unlinked. ""No one can be stopped from getting work, but we need to bring transparency.""

Asked about the modalities to cover those who are not yet linked, he said it will be decided after holding discussions with state governments. District collectors or district magistrates will have the right to take a decision.

The Rural Development Ministry had said on Monday if certain gram panchayats have ""technical issues"", the government may consider them for an exemption for mandatory payments through ABPS.

""This is not Rajiv Gandhi's government that 15 paisa from a rupee will reach people. The Narendra Modi government is focused on transparency,"" Singh said, rejecting Jairam Ramesh's criticism.

""Jairam Ramesh has also been Minister in this department. MGNREGA money used to go to account, and it would change several hands before reaching the beneficiaries... There are benefits of Aadhaar-linking. Money is going into the accounts of workers. They are spreading misinformation because they want the loot to continue,"" he said.

The minister said between 2014-15 and 2023-24, 2,688 mandays of work were generated under MGNREGA, which was 1,660 between 2006-07 and 2013-14 under the Manmohan Singh government.

The minister added that the union government under PM Narendra Modi has released Rs 6,74,790 crore for the scheme since 2014-15, while under the Congress reign, Rs, 2,13,220 crore was released by the Center between 2006-07 to 2013-14.

Singh said while as per the earlier system, MGNREGA beneficiaries could receive payment through mixed route (National Automated Clearing House or APBS), it was brought to the notice of the Centre that in many cases beneficiaries have made repeated changes in the bank account number and many wage payment transactions were being rejected due to account number being old.

He said ABPS was found to be the best solution for this.

Asked about the large number of deletions of job cards, the minister said, ""There were scams, so cards were deleted... Modi ji does not support scams.""

According to data presented by the Rural Development Ministry in Lok Sabha, over 2.18 crore job cards -- affecting more than 5.48 crore workers -- were deleted in 2022-23, a jump of 267 per cent compared to 2021-22.

More than 67.57 lakh job cards were deleted in 2023-24.

A job card is issued to a family under MGNREGA, and can have more than one workers. The minister also said voter cards will also be linked with Aadhaar in coming days. ""Would the opposition tell people not to vote if voter id cards are linked with Aadhaar?"" he asked.

Singh also denied claimed about workers being left behind. ""Who is being left behind? We have linked almost 99 percent of people with Aadhaar. The one percent that is left will also be done by states. We will not let the workers lose"".

Congress treasurer Ajay Maken said the online donation campaign launched by the party on December 18 has crossed the Rs 100 million (Rs 10 crore) mark in the New Year.

""New Year, New Milestones - We just crossed Rs 10 crores in 2 weeks. As 2024 unfolds, we at the Indian National Congress are thrilled to share two significant achievements: Celebrating 138 Years of Service: Our journey in serving our great nation has now spanned 138 remarkable years. Phenomenal Success in Online Donations: Our online donation campaign (https://donateinc.in) marks culmination of 2nd week with a groundbreaking milestone. We've raised a whopping Rs 100 Million (Rs 10 crore),"" Maken said in a post on X.

""A heartfelt Thank You: To the lakhs of supporters who have joined us in this journey - your generosity is overwhelming. With 2,48,929 (2.49 lakhs) valid transaction requests in just two weeks, your support is the backbone of this success,"" he said.

Urging those who have not contributed so far to come forward and donate to the party, Maken said, ""A Call to Action: Haven't contributed yet? Now is the time to strengthen our democracy. Join us in this vital exercise. Already contributed? Consider supporting again as per your capability. Every contribution, big or small, is a step towards a stronger nation.""

""Remember, the nation needs you, the Indian National Congress needs you. Your support fuels our mission and empowers us to keep moving forward. Together, let's make 2024 a year of unparalleled success and progress. Join us, contribute, and be a part of this historic journey,"" the Congress treasurer said in his post.

The Congress had launched its 'Donate for Desh' crowdfunding campaign on December 18 with party chief Mallikarjun Kharge donating Rs 1.38 lakh to the party on the first day. The campaign is aimed at generating resources for the party ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.

The BJP has, however, hit out at the opposition party, alleging it was ""another attempt to siphon off public money and enrich the Gandhis"" and pointed to the recent record cash seizure during income tax raids against a company linked to a Congress MP.

Congress leaders have said that the crowdfunding initiative was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's historic 'Tilak Swaraj Fund', which was launched more than a hundred years ago in 1920-21.

The party had launched an 'outreach-cum-crowdfunding' campaign on October 2, 2018, ahead of the last general elections, but the campaign did not gain much momentum on the ground.

The campaign was launched to coincide with the 138th year of the formation of the Congress.

The initiative aims at empowering the party in creating a country that is rich in equal resource distribution and opportunities, a senior leader said.

Donors have been asked to donate in the multiples of Rs 138, symbolising the party's enduring commitment to a better India.

Congress sources said the party is cash-strapped and facing a dearth of money to fight ""the well-oiled BJP poll machinery"". The grand old party has alleged that the BJP is garnering a majority of electoral bonds as the scheme is designed to favour the ruling party.

""Our inaugural campaign -- 'Donate for Behtar Bharat' -- commemorates the 138-year journey of the Indian National Congress. Embracing our history, we invite supporters to donate in multiples of Rs 138, symbolising the party's enduring commitment to a better India,"" AICC general secretary K C Venugopal had said ahead of the campaign launch.

They tricked people with fake online jobs and investment promises, offering big salaries and profits.

The Mumbai Police caught Rupesh Pravikumar Thakkar, 33, and Pankajbhai Govardhan Oad, 34, after a teenager lost Rs 2.45 lakh and reported them.

The investment scam
The scam started when a 19-year-old student named Krish fell for an online job ad, thinking he could make money by writing restaurant reviews. They promised him a weekly salary of Rs 10,000 and daily bonuses of Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000. Krish also got lured into investing money by a woman named Maria, who promised him even more profits.

As per police report, Krish invested Rs 1,000, and got messages saying he earned Rs 1,650, but when he tried to get his money back, he couldn't. The Mumbai police, with help from cybercrime experts, tracked down and arrested the two.

The police found Rs 1.1 crore in their bank accounts, blocked the funds, and after looking into it more, they learned that these guys cheated many others, totaling Rs 60 crore. But even though they caught these two, the main person behind the scam is still not caught, and the police think he might be hiding in London.

The 1,643-km-long India-Myanmar border, which passes through Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, currently has FMR. It was implemented in 2018 as part of India's Act East policy.

Under the FMR, every member of the hill tribes, who is either a citizen of India or a citizen of Myanmar and who is resident of any area within 16 km on either side of border can cross over on production of a border pass with one year validity and can stay up to two weeks per visit.

""We are going to end the FMR along the Indo-Myanmar border soon. We are going to put fencing along the entire border. The fencing will be completed in next four-and-a-half years. Anyone coming through will have to...get a visa,"" the functionary said.

The idea is to not only to stop the misuse of FMR, which is used by insurgent groups to carry out attacks on Indian side and flee towards Myanmar, but also put a halt to influx of illegal immigrants, and paralyse drugs and gold smuggling networks.

Tendering for an advanced smart fencing system for 300 km of the India-Myanmar border is already in pipeline and the work will be started very soon.

It may be mentioned that Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh had urged the Centre in September 2023 to end the FMR. The state government has argued that insurgents use the free movement regime to further their activities.

Manipur shares around 390 km of porous border with Myanmar and only about 10 km has been fenced so far. In July last year, the state government shared data that around 700 illegal immigrants entered the state.

Besides, Mizoram has seen an influx of anti-Junta rebels in thousands since the military coup in Myanmar on February 1, 2021. According to government estimates, several thousand refugees are living in different parts of Mizoram since the coup.

Mizoram shares a 510-km-long porous border with Myanmar.

The Manipur chief minister had also said that several persons from Myanmar tried to enter into his state but returned on seeing the presence of a large number of security personnel. Manipur shares a 398-km border with Myanmar.

Arunachal Pradesh shares a 520-km border with Myanmar while Nagaland shares a 215-km border with the country.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/declaration-of-dividends-by-banks-rbi-reviews-certain-norms-eligibility-criteria/articleshow/106489108.cms,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Tuesday reviewed the norms, eligibility criteria and board oversights pertaining to the declaration of dividends by the banks.

The guidelines have been reviewed in the light of implementation of Basel III standards, the revision of the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework, and the introduction of differentiated banks, the RBI said.

The apex bank, as part of its latest release has asked the banks to consider divergence in classification and provisioning for Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), including its trend, as observed under supervisory findings of the Reserve Bank or National Bank for Agriculture while considering the proposal for declaration of dividends or remittance of profits.

The banks must also give due consideration to the auditors' findings and Emphasis of Matter in the Audit report before declaring their dividends.

However, to be able declare their dividends the banks must adhere to the following criteria:

The RBI has said that the bank shall have met the applicable regulatory capital requirement for each of the last three financial years including the financial year for which the dividend is proposed.

As for the NPA parameter, the central bank has announced that the net NPA ratio shall be less than six per cent for the financial year for which the dividend is proposed.

It is to be noted that as per the new guidelines, eligible banks may pay dividend subject to the requirement that the proposed amount should include dividend on equity shares only.

The Reserve Bank has suggested raising the dividend payout ratio ceiling to 50 per cent if the net NPA is zero, from the previous 40 per cent cap, a move which appears to be a divergence from the current guidelines. The dividend payout ratio is the ratio of the amount of dividend payable in a year to the net profit.

Further, in case the net profit for the relevant period includes any exceptional and/or extra-ordinary profits/ income, or if the financial statements are qualified (including ‘emphasis of matter’) by the statutory auditor that indicates an overstatement of net profit, RBI has mandated that the same shall be reduced from net profit while determining the Dividend Payout Ratio.

Presently, all scheduled commercial banks (excluding regional rural banks) declare dividends under guidelines rolled out on May 4, 2005. Meanwhile, remittance of profit by foreign banks operating in India is implemented in pursuance to circular as issued November 6, 2003.

The new guidelines, as per RBI, shall be effective for declaration of dividends for the FY 2024-25 and onwards.

Many passengers were seen stranded at the Inter State Bus Terminus (ISBT) in state capital Bhopal as drivers did not operate the inter-city buses on Tuesday morning.

Some commuters complained of facing difficulties in travelling from Bhopal to Indore.

Huge crowds were also seen at petrol pumps in Bhopal, Indore and other cities on Tuesday morning to refuel their vehicle tanks amid the drivers' agitation.

Some people claimed they could not get their vehicles refuelled as petrol pumps ran dry.

However, the administration in various MP districts and major cities like Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior and Jabalpur said there was no shortage of fuel at petrol pumps under their areas of jurisdiction.

Drivers of commercial vehicles, including trucks and tankers, stopped work in parts of Madhya Pradesh from Monday and blocked roads at some places to protest against a provision in the new penal law.

Under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, which will replace the colonial era Indian Penal Code, drivers who cause a serious road accident by negligent driving and run away without informing the police or any official from the administration can face punishment of up to 10 years or a fine of Rs 7 lakh.

Talking to PTI, All India Motor Transport Congress former vice president (western region) Vijay Kalra claimed, ""Around five lakh small and big vehicles are not able to run in Madhya Pradesh due to the drivers' strike against the new law.""

Kalra demanded that the government withdraw the provisions of strict punishment to drivers in ""hit-and-run"" cases and separate lanes be created for commercial vehicles, especially on highways, to prevent road accidents.

In Gwalior, the agitating drivers staged a protest on Jhansi Road.

According to officials, the public transport facilities in Indore city as well as the operation of inter-city passenger buses have been affected due to the drivers' strike, causing inconvenience to thousands of travellers.

Passengers were seen stranded at the ISBT in Bhopal.

Commuter Raghav Gurjar at the ISBT on Tuesday morning said he had to go to Indore but it was difficult for him to find a vehicle.

""I thought at least we will find electric buses. I can't find chartered or any other bus as they are also not running. We are trying to look for taxis to reach home,"" he said.

Commuter Umesh Solanki from Bhopal also said he had to travel to Indore for some urgent office work, but was stuck at the bus station since all the chartered buses were cancelled.

Electric buses and taxis are also not running, he said.

Crowds of people anxious to refuel their vehicles were seen at some petrol pumps in Bhopal.

Bramhadev Tiwari, who runs a petrol pump in the state capital, said, ""There has been a strike by truck drivers, so we sent our own tanker to the depot, but other truckers there did not allow us to procure fuel which led to problems here (at the fuel pump).""

After a huge demand from the crowd, he said his petrol pump ran out of fuel.

Sharad Rangari, a two-wheeler owner in Bhopal, said he kept waiting for one-and-a-half-hours to refuel his vehicle but when his turn came, the petrol pump ran out of stock.

""There is a problem. Everyone has been facing problems. Someone's patient is admitted, someone has to go to work, someone has to go to pick up their children,"" he said.

Madhya Pradesh Petroleum Dealers Association president Ajay Singh told PTI in Bhopal that the fuel supply situation will be normalised across the state by Tuesday evening.

""We have persuaded our tanker drivers and they have reached the petrol depots to bring the fuel for supply at petrol pumps,"" he said.

On Monday night, Bhopal Collector Ashish Singh went to a petrol depot here to monitor the situation of fuel supply.

After the inspection, he said the petroleum companies were carrying out the work of fuel supply through their own vehicles.

""Ten lakh litres of petrol and diesel have been supplied through the vehicles of petroleum companies. People do not need to panic and queue up at the fuel stations,"" he said.

Indore's Ahilya Chamber of Commerce and Industries president Ramesh Khandelwal said if the drivers' strike continues, the supply of essential commodities will worsen which will have a direct impact on consumers.

He said the government should reconsider the provisions of strict punishment in ""hit-and-run"" cases.

Indore Collector Ilayaraja T said there was no shortage of petrol and diesel in the district and these fuels were being supplied continuously.

The collectors of various other districts including Rewa, Alirajpur, Anuppur, Shahdol and Narmadapuram also appealed to the people not to panic as an adequate supply of fuel was being maintained.

On Monday, state Transport Minister Rao Uday Pratap Singh appealed to the agitating drivers to discuss their issue with the government.

""Enacting a law doesn't mean it was made to take penal action against them. They should sort out the issue through discussions. We will talk to them,"" he said, adding the government will ensure smooth movement of people and vehicles on priority.

The company reported a standalone revenue of Rs 13,247.33 crore for the quarter ended December, compared to Rs 11,304.6 crore in the same quarter last year.

From Rs 7,433 crore during the pandemic-hit December quarter of 2020, the company’s revenue has grown steadily over the last three years.

As of December end, the DMart hypermarket chain operator had 341 stores, implying a net addition of 5 stores during the quarter.

The net store addition in the December quarter was lower than that in September quarter, as the company had added nine stores in that period.

The same-store sales growth will be closely tracked by analysts and investors, which remained strong in the September quarter.

While the company did not provide any details on the earnings, strong festive sales are likely to have driven consumption of discretionary items as well as foods and fast-moving consumer goods during the quarter.

For the September quarter, the Radhakishan Damani-owned company had reported a nearly 19% YoY growth in consolidated revenue, but profit fell by 9%.

On Tuesday, shares of the DMart owner ended nearly 1% up on the National Stock Exchange at Rs 4,103.35. In 2023, when the Nifty 50 rallied 20% and scaled a lifetime high, Avenue Supermarts was a big underperformer, as the stock gave flat returns to investors."

Zomato anticipated that New Year's Eve would be a busy day, so the preparation started weeks earlier, a senior executive at the company told us. The tech team had to ensure the app wouldn't buckle under the order blizzard. Meanwhile, the supply crews stocked restaurants up, anticipating a 30-40% demand spike. To keep the wheels turning, delivery platforms offered extra cash to delivery executives, boosting their driver numbers by 30-35% in some places.

The company's New Year's Eve battleground, or 'war room' as it was titled, brewed a different storm online. Photos of this ""war room"" shared by Goyal in a celebratory spirit, invited debate online, with some saying the company is setting a bad precedent for tech companies and startups by overworking their employees.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/canara-bank-to-open-cyber-security-wing-stepping-up-ai-adoption-to-predict-online-frauds-loan-defaults/articleshow/106486288.cms,"Public sector banking behemoth Canara Bank will open a separate cyber-security wing from April 1 as the bank steps up its investment in cyber security initiatives to prevent customers from falling into the trap of online fraudsters.

The wing will be headed by a general manager and monitor digital transactions on a real time basis and trigger alerts if a fraudster is trying to break into a customer’s account. “Cyber security will demand a lot of investments in future, and we want to stay ahead in this,” MD & CEO K Satyanarayana Raju told ET. Raju’s team is implementing a three-year roadmap the bank prepared last year on technology initiatives to stay ahead of the curve.

After opening the bank’s new data and analytics centre (DnA) in , the MD said the PSU bank had been at the forefront in leveraging analytics for improving customer experience and operations. “AI is reshaping our lives in unprecedented ways, and we are committed to adopting it to spur business growth while ensuring data privacy and security.""



The bank held a hackathon from October 20 onwards around the broad themes of customer experience, and default and fraud predictions which led to enthusiastic participation from the youth. The bank distilled the sea of ideas to 256 sharp ones with 11 prototypes shortlisted by a technical jury. The bank honoured five finalists on Monday with cash awards.

“We are pursuing efforts to improve customer experience, predict loan defaults and identify and prevent transactional frauds using analytics-based technology solutions,” Raju said. A bank’s asset quality, he added, depended on efficiency in collection. If the collection exercise is entirely human driven, then there would be gaps. Technology can help here by vetting a person’s credit history and spending behavior. AI/ML tools can help predict chances of a default by a customer.

The bank was open to hire talented youngsters who chipped in winning ideas at the hackathon, the MD said. If any of the 250 participants wished to be part of the bank, the management would be happy to have them. “We have our own fintech policy and want to attract tech-savvy people.”





The digital transactions had leapfrogged from under Rs 1 crore a year, three years ago, to more than Rs 600 crore a year now. While more users getting into digital transactions would help banks reduce their operating costs, banks must also prepare to deal with the challenges that come along, Raju said.

While acknowledging the rising number of online frauds, the MD said they were still miniscule compared with the global trends. “Even a single case of fraud is a matter of concern for us. We therefore set up an exclusive wing to monitor transactions real time, last year, to prevent frauds.”

With transaction volumes growing at a frenetic pace, no amount of manpower would be sufficient to deal with the problem. The bank figured AI could give the solution. The bank was now using the AI/ML tools in cases where fraud attempts were repetitive. The employee team, on the other hand, would focus on first-time fraud attempts, the MD said.

In most cases of online frauds, scamsters get away by using the credentials customers innocently shared. “In the event our system detects a suspicious account, then such accounts are blocked and heightened due diligence will follow. Such accounts are unlocked only if the account holder approaches the bank and establishes his credentials. This way we hope to save some money of our customers,” Raju said."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/karnataka-cm-siddaramaiah-defends-arrest-of-kar-sevaks-hits-back-at-bjp/articleshow/106491534.cms,"Karnataka: Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Tuesday defended the arrest of two kar sevaks amid attacks by the BJP leaders including union minister Pralhad Joshi, state president Vijayendra Yediyurappa, Opposition leader R Ashoka and former CM Basavaraj Bommai, who have questioned the propriety of the government action ahead of the opening of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya.

The Hubballi-Dharwad Police have arrested two persons, who are in their 60s now, for participating in the Ayodhya march 31 years ago.

The CM, speaking to media at Vijayapura, lashed out at Joshi, who represents Dharwad in the Lok Sabha, saying a criminal was always a criminal until cleared by a court of law. “A crime does not fade away with time. Until a court acquits, a criminal remains a criminal,” Siddaramaiah said wondering aloud if the union minister knew the matters of law.

While the government was going by the law of the land while Joshi was looking at the issue politically, the CM said after the issue threatened to snowball into a major political issue.

The police acted on orders from Home Minister G Parameshwara, who wanted the police to pursue old cases and dispose them of, Siddaramaiah said, while denying the government indulged in the politics of vendetta. “What should be done to wrong-doers. Should they be let off,” the CM asked at the Koppal air strip.

Vijayendra Yediyurappa said the Congress regime was targeting Hindus at a time the nation was celebrating the auspicious occasion of opening of Ram Mandir. “Congress govt has always put hurdles on the construction of Ram Mandir at every step from the beginning. As if that was not enough, instead of making amends, even now it is trying to stop Ram Bhakts from celebrating during this over joyous occasion,” he said in a statement.

Joshi, speaking to the media, said the government action showed desperation on the part of Siddaramaiah who had been caught between hard choices: if he decided to attend the Ram temple event, opponents of the Mandir would feel offended. If he were to skip, the devotees of Lord Ram will question. To overcome this confusion, Siddaramaiah was digging 30 year old cases, Joshi said.

When the matter came up for hearing on Monday, Justice Sandeep Bhatt told Setalvad's lawyer, ""After going through the record, I am not inclined (to grant relief).""

The activist's lawyer said that while it was the court's prerogative, he would try to convince her because no offence was made out against her.

""Ultimately, it is political victimisation (of his client),"" he said.

The hearing was then adjourned till January 9 after the government pleader sought accommodation saying that additional advocate general Mitesh Amin would appear in the case.

Setalvad had filed a plea in 2017 after her name was included in the FIR in connection with exhuming 28 bodies from a mass burial site near Pandarwada in Panchmahal district in December 2005.

The activist was accused of conspiring to exhume the bodies after the other accused in the case, including Rais Khan, a former coordinator at her NGO Citizen for Justice and Peace, made a statement against her under section 164 of CrPC.

The Gujarat police had lodged an FIR for creating false evidence, trespassing on a burial place, and outraging religious feelings.

The Lunawada municipality, the complainant in the case, had named Khan as an accused. Khan's statement after his falling out with Setalvad led to her name being added as an accused in the FIR in 2011.

Setalvad, along with former IPS officers RB Sreekumar and Sanjiv Bhatt, were booked by the city crime branch in June 2022 on the charges of fabricating evidence to frame Prime Minister Narendra Modi and others in cases related to the post-Godhra riots.

They were arrested in the case and are currently out on bail.

Asheesh Sharma has taken over as president of the short courses and bootcamps division effective Tuesday, upGrad said in a statement.

“Asheesh, with a rich professional background in education spanning more than two decades, assumes a pivotal role at upGrad KnowledgeHut. He will lead P&L growth, bring new program innovations to the fore, and expand its core offerings internationally,” it said.

Reddy, who founded KnowledgeHut in 2011, had stepped down on December 5 and did not serve any notice period, the company said.

His was the second high-profile exit from UpGrad in 2023 after its erstwhile chief executive Arjun Mohan stepped down in January. Mohan joined K-12-focused edtech Byju’s.

KnowledgeHut had a presence in over 70 countries by the time upGrad had acquired it. It contributes majorly to upGrad’s enterprise business as a skills transformation partner to clients.

For the year ended March 2023, upGrad had nearly doubled its turnover year on year to Rs 1,194 crore. Losses at the Mumbai-based company, however, widened 67% to Rs 1,142 crore in FY23 from Rs 684 crore in the previous year.

Changes in FY23 included a reduction in marketing costs, making up 19% of total costs at Rs 371 crore, lower than 33% of costs at Rs 403 crore a year earlier. Employee costs remained the highest contributor at 36%, amounting to Rs 707 crore, which also included some non-cash costs for employee stock options.

The Prime Minister hailed Tamil Nadu for its cultural inspiration and by praising DMDK late leader Vijayakanth rooted for nationalism while Chief Minister M K Stalin championed the social justice-led Dravidian model of governance which, among other goals, is also aimed at taking education to all.

Against the background of recent rains, floods and consequent damage and loss of lives in Chennai and southern Tamil Nadu, while PM Modi said the Centre was providing all possible support, Stalin urged him to declare the heavy showers-deluge as 'severe natural disasters' and release appropriate funds to the state from National Disaster Relief Fund.

Modi laid the foundation stone, inaugurated and dedicated to the nation, 20 projects related to air and seaports, railway, highway, petroleum and natural gas, atomic energy and higher education in the state from this central Tamil Nadu district, located about 300 km from state capital Chennai. Earlier, he attended the 38th Convocation of Bharathidasan University here.

The projects, the Prime Minister said will strengthen Tamil Nadu's progress and boost ease of travel and create thousands of employment opportunities.

Stalin said the state governments, being close to the people, have the duty of providing students access to education, health care amenities and all other necessary assistance to people.

Hence, reiterating a request for Central funding to tackle the aftermath of floods and rains and establishing state rights is only ""the demand of the people and not a political rhetoric"", the CM asserted.

Inaugurating the new terminal building at Tiruchirappalli International Airport, the PM said, ""our endeavour is to consistently expand the cultural inspiration derived from Tamil Nadu in the development of the country.""

The 'revered Sengol' has been installed in the new Parliament building in Delhi. It is an inspiration driven from the model of good governance given by Tamil culture to the whole country.

The 'Azadi Ka Amrit Kaal' for the next 25 years will play a crucial role in India becoming a developed nation, which has both economic and cultural dimensions, the PM added.

India is proud of the vibrant culture and heritage of Tamil Nadu, he said.

While taking part in public events in the past, Modi, who had spoken in English on most occasions on Tuesday spoke in Hindi as well.

In his address, the Prime Minister referred to last month's rains and floods in the state and the consequent losses and said he was deeply moved by the condition of affected families.

""The central government stands with people of Tamil Nadu in this time of crisis. We are providing every possible support to the state government.""

Modi praised Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) leader Vijayakanth who passed away days ago as a 'captain' in both cinema and politics.

As a leader, in politics, Vijayakanth always placed national interest above everything, the PM said.

""I pay my tributes to him, I also express my condolences to his family and admirers.""

He also remembered eminent farm scientist M S Swaminathan of Tamil Nadu, who passed away recently and said he ensured food security for the country.

Today, the PM said, the nation was making unprecedented investment in physical and social infrastructure and it is among the top 5 economies, emerging as a new hope.

TN is becoming a very significant brand ambassador for 'Make In India,' he added.

The Prime Minister reiterated the Central government's approach where the development of the state reflects in the development of the nation.

He said more than 40 Union ministers toured Tamil Nadu more than 400 times in the past year. ""India will progress with the progress of Tamil Nadu"", he said and underscored on connectivity, which is the route for development giving a boost to businesses and makes people's lives easier.

The new terminal building here will increase capacity by three times and strengthen connectivity with East Asia, Middle East and create new opportunities for investments, businesses, education, health and tourism.

He expressed satisfaction that the airport with its strengthened infrastructure will introduce the world to Tamil culture and heritage.

In his Bharathidasan University convocation address, he said one of the factors behind the rise of India today, is the 'rise of our universities.'

India is setting records in economic growth as the fastest growing major economy. At the same time, universities are also entering global rankings in record numbers.

Bharat and civilisation have always been centred around knowledge. Ancient universities such as Nalanda and Vikramashila are well known and there are references to Kanchipuram housing great varsities and Madurai serving as a centre of learning, he said.

The origin of modern day concept of convocation could be traced to the Sangam era wherein literary works were submitted for scrutiny for recognition.

On the new railway projects, PM Modi said they will promote industry and electricity generation. The new road projects will connect important centers of faith and tourism like Srirangam, Chidambaram, Rameshwaram and Vellore.

The projects inaugurated include electrification of Tiruchchirappali-Manamadurai-Virudunagar railway line.

The PM said that in the decade before 2014, states were given Rs 30 lakh crore; whereas in the last 10 years states were given Rs 120 lakh crore.

Tamil Nadu too got 2.5 times more in this period as compared to the 10 years preceding 2014.

For national highway construction, more than three times expenditure was done in the state and 2.5 times more money was spent in the railways sector in the state, he said.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/uk/government-disputes-claims-of-cleared-asylum-backlog-despite-lingering-cases/articleshow/106491376.cms,"In recent developments, the Home Secretary rebuffed assertions that the government had successfully cleared the backlog of older asylum claims, despite initial promises by PM Rishi Sunak to eliminate the backlog by the close of 2023. New statistics reveal a remaining total of 99,000 unresolved asylum cases.

According to James Cleverly, all legacy applications filed before the asylum law alterations in 2022 had been processed, yet approximately 4,500 ""complex"" cases, including some entailing security concerns, remain under scrutiny by the Home Office.

The government attributes the decrease in total asylum claims to the resolution of the ""legacy"" backlog—applications submitted before June 28, 2022. However, critics have accused the government of manipulating these figures.

Cleverly defended the reduction in the asylum backlog, attributing it to a ""tenfold increase in the pace at which we complete the processing."" He emphasized the government's bolstering of the asylum system by incorporating more personnel, refining processes, and implementing enhanced accountability measures.

Nevertheless, Stephen Kinnock of the Labour party contested the government's assertions, labeling them ""false"" and emphasizing a substantial increase in the asylum backlog during the Tory administration. He criticized the withdrawal of over 17,000 asylum seekers from this backlog, expressing concerns about their whereabouts and potential reapplications or integration into the underground economy.

Enver Solomon, the Refugee Council's chief executive, acknowledged progress in clearing cases but criticized the government for its misleading claims, citing the thousands still awaiting decisions. He also criticized the Home Office for losing track of individuals removed from the asylum process.

Despite the claims by the government, the Home Office disclosed that over 112,000 asylum cases were processed in the past year, surpassing the PM's commitment. Notably, in a four-week period from November 20 to December 17, 2023, initial asylum decisions totaled 20,481—exceeding the entire 2021 figures.

PM Sunak lauded the department's efforts, emphasizing cost-saving benefits, reduced strain on public services, and improved support for the most vulnerable individuals.

The legacy cases, referring to those in the asylum system on June 28, 2022, have been reviewed, yet not all have been resolved, with 4,500 reclassified as ""complex."" These complex cases typically involve asylum seekers with issues related to age verification, serious medical conditions, or suspected convictions.

Key pledges made by the PM last year included priorities like curbing Channel crossings, and recent data shows a 36% decrease in the number of migrants crossing the Channel compared to the record-high crossings in 2022.

Additionally, the government highlighted achievements in returning over 24,000 individuals with no right to stay in the UK, including more than 5,500 Albanians. Enforcement visits surged to 10,509 in the first nine months of 2023, up from 6,865 in the same period in 2022. Moreover, 246 people smugglers were arrested in 2023.

The dispute regarding the clearance of the asylum backlog persists, with contrasting views on the government's claims and the actual situation concerning unresolved cases and reclassified complexities.

The assailant, a 66-year-old individual, inflicted a 1cm laceration on Lee's neck during a media briefing, leading to immediate uproar and condemnation across the nation. President Yoon Suk Yeol and various political entities swiftly expressed their denouncement of the assault.

During a routine visit to a construction site in Busan, Lee was unexpectedly approached by the attacker, feigning a request for an autograph. In a sudden turn, the assailant brandished an 18cm knife purchased online, launching an unprovoked attack on the opposition leader. Swift actions from those present led to the attacker's capture and prompt medical attention for Lee.

Medical professionals attending to Lee expressed grave concerns over a potential injury to his jugular vein, underscoring the urgent need for surgery to prevent further complications. The assault, perceived as a direct threat to democratic values, sparked strong reactions from Lee's political party, highlighting the gravity of the incident in the country's political landscape.

Lee Jae-myung, a prominent figure in South Korean politics, has championed causes against societal inequalities, drawing from his impoverished upbringing and background in civil rights advocacy. However, his political journey has been marred by allegations of corruption. Despite facing legal challenges post the 2022 presidential elections, Lee remains a key figure with potential aspirations for future political endeavors.

The attack on Lee Jae-myung rekindles past incidents involving assaults on South Korean political figures. While the country boasts a generally low crime rate and stringent weapon regulations, this event reignites concerns about the safety and security of public figures. Instances of violence against politicians in the past underscore the necessity of reevaluating security measures for political figures in the nation.

This incident serves as a critical juncture for reexamining political security and the safety protocols surrounding public figures in South Korea. The event highlights the urgency of addressing and fortifying the security measures concerning the country's political representatives.

Sharmila, who chaired her party meeting today, said she and other leaders will meet the top leadership of the Congress including AICC President Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi and make a ""crucial"" announcement in Delhi tomorrow.

Sharmila is the daughter of former chief minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh, the late Y S Rajasekhara Reddy, and younger sister of Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy. Sources told PTI that Sharmila will be given a post in Congress at the national level and is likely to be made in-charge of elections for Southern states after the merger of YSRTP with Congress.

""Everything will be clear in one or two days. Please be patient,"" she told reporters after the meeting, when asked. The Congress leadership assured Sharmila that her colleagues in Telangana will be suitably placed, the sources added.

Sharmila had announced her support to Congress during the recent assembly polls in Telangana, to end the allegedly corrupt and anti-people rule of BRS led by K Chandrasekhar Rao. She earlier said her discussions with Congress party on working together, or a possible merger, have reached a final stage.

In this shocking video, Indian Railways housekeeping staff could be seen throwing garbage out of a moving train. The video has gone viral and invited innumerable reactions from people. And it has also caught the attention of the Central Railway, Mumbai Division.

The video was shared on X, previously Twitter, by the page @mumbaimatterz. In the video, a cleaning staff throws away the trash from black-coloured plastic bags and also uses a wiper to dispose of the garbage lying on the train's floor. All the trash is being emptied out on the railway tracks by a moving train.

""This seems to be the normal practice of the on-board housekeeping staff inside #IndianRailways trains. Just dump the all the collected trash on the tracks from the moving train. A passenger lodged a complaint on 139 and in no time the supervisor and entire gang turned trying to find who has complained and why? Saying they aren't paid properly, not provided enough bags to collect trash and so they are managing with meagre resources,"" the caption over the video read.

Since being shared on December 31, the video clip has gone viral and has already amassed more than four lakh views. Moreover, it has also received 3,000 likes and numerous comments. Many users expressed shock over the clip and also shared their personal experience on X.

Meanwhile, the Central Railway, Mumbai Division, has also responded to the post and asked for the PNR and train number to take action against the staff.

Here are some of the reactions:

An user wrote, ""Thank God ..! Air India the national carrier doesn’t have this access in air .. or else the flight attendants too will do the same ..""

A second user commented, ""Shocking to say the least. While we conduct clean-ups across the country, the railway employees seem to have a no-care attitude about waste management. @RailMinIndia.""

A third added, ""This is unacceptable, the government is spending huge money on railways.""

""The railways need a revolution in waste management. It can only happen when proper systems are set. Else our railway tracks will continue to be dump yards,"" posted a fourth.

A fifth user said, ""@PMOIndia @AshwiniVaishnaw- Swach Bharat Abhiyan going for toss. One of the possible reasons for wild animals to come near tracks in search of food & get hurt.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/army-to-be-deployed-across-bangladesh-from-jan-3-ahead-of-polls-defence-ministry/articleshow/106489901.cms,"Thousands of armed forces personnel will be deployed across Bangladesh from Wednesday to ensure that the January 7 general elections are held in a free, fair, and peaceful manner, the Defence Ministry said on Tuesday. The armed forces will assist the Election Commission and local civil administration till January 10 to help maintain law and order before, during, and after the upcoming national polls, a press release by the ministry said.

The Army will be deployed in 62 districts and will perform duties jointly with the Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) in 47 bordering upazilas, the release said.

A total of 1,151 platoons of paramilitary border guards were deployed across the country on December 29, who will work in tandem with the police, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), and armed forces for 13 days surrounding the January 7 polls.

More than 1.89 lakh policemen have also been deployed nationwide to ensure law and order ahead of the elections.

The BGB members will solely be deployed in 45 upazilas and will be accompanied by the Coast Guards in four coastal upazilas.

While the country's Navy will perform duties in a total of 19 upazilas, including the coastal districts of Bhola and Barguna, the Air Force is also set to provide necessary helicopter assistance to polling stations in remote hilly areas along with electoral assistance in case of emergencies.

Special cells have also been set up jointly by representatives of the armed forces and law enforcement agencies across the country, which will remain operational till January 10, the release said.

The January 7 polls are being boycotted by the main opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) led by former prime minister Khalida Zia, as its demand for an interim non-party neutral government to organise the voting was rejected by the government headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

Hasina is also the president of the ruling Awami League.

The BNP boycotted the 2014 election but took part in the 2018 polls, which party leaders later said was a mistake, alleging that the voting was marred with widespread rigging and intimidation.

Meanwhile, the BNP and its allies were criticised by ruling Awami League's General Secretary Obaidul Quader on Tuesday, who said that the January 7 polls will be participatory, the Dhaka Tribune newspaper reported.

Calling the BNP's leaflet distribution mysterious, Quader, also the road transport and bridges minister, said that the activists of the main opposition party might carry out an attack anytime.

""But they will not be able to thwart the election no matter how hard they try,"" he was quoted as saying in the report.

On Monday, Prime Minister Hasina said the BNP is boycotting Sunday's general election because they found no scope to rig the polls.

Claiming that the BNP had tried to foil the 2014 parliamentary election through violence but failed, Hasina said, ""Now they are out to thwart the 12th parliamentary election slated for January 7 for which they are once again burning people to death through arson violence and subversive acts.""

The BNP has called for civil disobedience against the Hasina-led dispensation, urging people not to pay taxes and utility bills to press its demand for a non-party interim government for election oversight by amending the country's Constitution.

It is also carrying out an anti-election street campaign, calling for intermittent strikes and transport blockades, saying no election under the incumbent government led by Hasina would be fair or neutral.

According to a media tally, 11 people died, 386 vehicles were torched, and four trains were derailed from tracks in the past two months in political violence.

The US and other major Western countries called for dialogue between the ruling Awami League and particularly with the BNP to ensure an inclusive and credible election, which, however, saw no headway due to reluctance from both sides.

With the BNP boycotting the election and no other credible opposition party against it, Hasina's Awami League is likely to gain the upper hand and will likely form the government for the fourth consecutive term.

Addressing a press conference at the AICC headquarters here, Congress' Ex-Servicemen Department chief Col (retd) Rohit Chaudhry said these youths were selected in the Army, Air Force and Navy between 2019-22 with all formalities like exams and verification documents completed.

They were to get their joining letters but with the arrival of the Agnipath Scheme, their dreams were ""shattered"", he said.

Chaudhry said 7,000 youth kept waiting for their joining letters for the Air Force, but did not get. Similarly, 2,500 nursing assistants in the Army were not given the opportunity to serve the country, he said.

He said that Rs 250 was taken from those who had applied in various recruitment drives and this totalled upto Rs 100 crore.

""In the 100 recruitments of the Army and Air Force in which more than 1.5 lakh children were selected, they should be given joining immediately,"" he asserted.

""The country should be given an account of the money that has been collected in the name of recruitment fees which is more than Rs 100 crore,"" Chaudhry said.

These 1.5 lakh youths should also be given due respect and age relaxation, he stressed.

Chaudhry claimed that the Agnipath Scheme is ""extremely dangerous and fatal"" for the country's security system.

Chaudhry's press conference comes close on the heels of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's interaction with a group of youths who, he said, had come on foot from Bihar's Champaran to express their struggle.

In his post along with the video, Gandhi had said that under the guise of the Agnipath Yojana, ""by cancelling the 'permanent recruitment' of the Army which was to run till 2019-21, the government ruined the dedication and dreams of countless hardworking and promising youths"".

The Agnipath scheme, announced on June 14, 2022, provides for the recruitment of youngsters in the age bracket of 17-and-a-half to 21 years for only four years with a provision to retain 25 per cent of them for 15 more years.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/esports-set-to-reach-new-heights-in-india-in-2024/articleshow/106490246.cms,"Prize money disbursement in esports tournaments this year is expected to surpass the Rs 30-35 crore mark cumulatively handed out in 2023 as such events continue to grow in reach and scale, and organisers remain upbeat.

Tournament organiser (TO) Skyesports alone has announced a target pool of $2.5 million (Rs 20 crore) to be paid out to winning teams in 2024. Game publisher Krafton, which disbursed Rs 3.8 crore in 2023, also said both the prize size and scale of its tournaments shall be higher in 2024 with more penetration in tier-2 and tier-3 cities. US game publisher Riot Games, which debuted in India with its first official event in December 2023, said its domestic league calendar is solid for 2024. Startup Upthrust Esports, which ran 10 championship IPs in 2023 for a cumulative prize pool of Rs 1.5 crore, said it will add three more to its portfolio in the coming fiscal.

Here’s an explainer on how the esports business is expected to evolve in 2024:

Scale of esports tournaments
“Our BGMI tournaments drew over 54,000 on-ground spectators and 110 million viewers for the live broadcast (in 2023),” said Sean Hyunil Sohn, CEO of Krafton India.

“We also saw a substantial rise in the prize pool for tournaments in the industry with Krafton India’s BGMI (Battlegrounds Mobile India) tournaments contributing to a total of Rs 3.8 crore… With new games on the horizon, we will continue to explore newer Esports tournament formats,” he added.

The likes of Krafton, Riot Games, Jetsyntheses, and Reliance Digital are investing big to take the online gaming world offline. Popular video games such as Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI), Valorant, Counter Strike, Dota, and Pokemon Unite are appealing to the masses in India, as millions of people participate either by playing them or viewing their favourite players compete in championships.

These championships, which were primarily held online on YouTube or streaming platforms like Loco and Rooter, have lately become larger than life offline local area network (LAN) events held in stadiums, just like physical sports – a phenomenon popular in the West.

As per market estimates, in 2023 organisers disbursed a cumulative prize pool of Rs 30-35 crore in both online and offline tournaments, the biggest in India's e-gaming history.

What lies ahead
Going forward, experts said the esports tournament ecosystem shall focus on three areas – making these events a gaming-cum-entertainment feast, pivoting towards profitability, and attracting more brand sponsorships, especially from non-endemic names.

“The year 2023 has shown that LAN events have the potential of attracting massive footfall,” said Siva Nandy, CEO of Skyesports. “Naturally, TOs will continue to surprise and entertain audiences with more celebrities and singers performing at LAN events… We shall also focus on making the business at least 10% Ebitda positive. To achieve this, as a TO, our aim is to work with over 50 brands this year,” he added.

Ashwin Suresh, founder of game streaming platform Loco, said TOs will also look at monetisation through ticketing, food and beverage spaces, larger advertising deals, and by adding VIP programmes as fans show readiness to pay for premium content.

“We are at the cusp of a huge paradigm shift in esports consumption as we speak,” he said. “Loco hosted its first VIP subscription LAN tournament streaming in 2023 which was completely behind paywall for online viewing. And, we witnessed 3-4% conversion rate, which is higher than the 1% global benchmark.”

Shift from online to offline
The popularity of LAN events is expected to steal the thunder of online competitions in terms of viewership and participation, executives said.

“Running an online IP is comparatively easier and profitable… A mid-size online tournament could be held in a budget of Rs 15 lakh, whereas a LAN event could range from anywhere between Rs 50 lakh to Rs 3 crore,” said Kartik Sabherwal, founder of Upthrust Esports.

However, he added, “Online does not bring any uniqueness and that’s why in the short term, we shall expect lesser interest there as popular teams refuse to compete or brands become reluctant to advertise.”

The professional esports or e-gaming industry in India (which is different from online gaming) was nearly a $40-million (Rs 333 crore) market in India in FY23 and is expected to scale up to $100 million by FY28, according to a study by venture capital firm Lumikai."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/with-growing-appetite-influx-of-influences-retail-participation-in-fo-may-increase-tradejini/articleshow/106465824.cms,"Over the past few years, there has been a visible shift in the retail investor behaviour, and their growing interest in the derivatives segment of the equity market. Investors seem to be more comfortable taking riskier assets, seeking higher returns in a low-interest environment, says Trivesh D, COO of online stock trading platform Tradejini.

“The appetite for options has undoubtedly grown..This pattern of increased participation in F&O is expected to continue and possibly increase as well with the influx of influencers and courses on the stock market,” Trivesh said in an interview with ETMarkets. Edited excerpts:


With markets seeing a strong bull run, how was 2023 for Tradejini?
Trivesh D: It has been a stable year for Tradejini. We have grown at a stable rate of 20–25% compared to last year. This growth isn’t just about numbers; it’s about the quality of clients we are attracting.

We also saw fewer clients with larger, more sophisticated investments on account of the improved tech offering and educational initiatives.

What is even more exciting is the engagement – these clients are informed, and actively trading through us. Their success breeds our success, as happy clients bring in referrals and trade more frequently.

With a strong platform, a trusted brand, and a commitment to client success, we are confident that Tradejini’s growth story is just a beginning.

What’s your overall view on markets for 2024? What are the key factors that will influence investor behaviour?
Trivesh D: I believe 2024 will be a breakthrough year for the Indian stock market. Newer, untapped industries and stocks will now be looked upon and also may see increased retail participation.

The upcoming Indian elections will be another factor to watch closely. The current government is predicted to retain power, with new policies and regulations in the 2024 Budget, impacting various sectors. New emerging markets will also be a key factor to watch.

I think FII inflows will play a significant role. Foreign institutional investors have been increasingly active in Indian markets, and their investment decisions will have a significant impact on the market in 2024.

With the US Fed expected to decrease the interest rates, India and other riskier countries will become preferred destinations for parking their investments.

Also, it will be a year of diversification across asset classes. Investors are likely to look beyond traditional equities and explore avenues like real estate, commodities, and even alternative investments like hedge funds and private equity.

Also, geopolitical issues remain a wild card, and trade policies or global events can significant impact market performance. There is no doubt that retail investors have emerged as the new bull of Dalal Street.

But over the last year, have you seen any visible difference in their behaviour?
Trivesh D: Over the past year, we have observed a visible shift in retail investor behaviour, waving a growing appetite for risk and a greater willingness to invest in the equity market.

Investors seem more comfortable taking riskier assets, seeking higher returns in a low-interest environment. This is evident in their increased allocation towards equities, particularly smaller-cap and mid-cap stocks.

We have also seen larger average investment sizes from retail participants. They are not just dipping their toes in, they are deploying significant capital.

Also, the appetite for options has undoubtedly grown. This is evident from the data published by the regulator along with the data that has been analysed internally.

This pattern of increased participation in F&O is expected to continue and possibly increase as well with the influx of influencers and courses on the stock market.

DIY investment patterns have increased compared to the advice-based investments which also implies the growing popularity of discount brokers, who offer low-cost platforms and empower investors to trade independently compared to traditional brokers. While DIY trends are undeniable, we have seen some uptick in demand for personalized portfolio management services amidst recent market corrections.

With rising retail participation, the need for risk awareness also increases. How are wealth tech platforms like yours empowering retail investors?
Trivesh D: So, the old “trade and forget” model is disappearing. Today’s investors demand more. They want a broker who is not just a button-pusher but a moderator in their financial journey, and that’s where Tradejini comes in.

We have features like Tring, which is a real-time alert, acting as a financial co-pilot. A few of the features are for the users who have risks associated with a particular trade before they execute the trade, such as giving them transparent disclaimers to highlight potential risks associated with T2T, social media-hyped, and illiquid stocks.

We also have set automated stop-loss orders to minimize losses. You can track your portfolio margin in real-time and stay ahead of volatility with visual indicators.

We have also launched an online e-platform at Jiniversity. Jiniversity offers in-depth, beginner-friendly courses on diverse topics, from basic investing concepts to advanced trading concepts.

The platform will continuously be updated with the latest financial information, interesting case studies, interactive tools, and engaging learning formats.

While digitalisation has gone a long way in transforming trading behaviour, recent technical glitches in wealth tech platforms like Zerodha continue to pose risks. What steps is Tradejini undertaking on this front?
Trivesh D: Well, I believe that brokers will no longer be just brokers in the classical sense. We are moving towards a future where brokers are welcoming digitalization and diversification.

In the coming times, brokers will become tech-savvy and offer a range of digital platforms. This could include AI-powered trading algorithms and content driven decision making.

The reality is that technology is rapidly changing the financial industry, and brokers are at the helm of the change.

In terms of technical glitches, it can happen with any broker. Although no brokerage firm can guarantee complete removal of glitches, but we take pride in our track record of minimal disruptions.

In the past 11 years, we had only two instances of technical glitches. What a broker can do is prepare themselves adequately in terms of the infrastructure required to handle the orders of the existing clients and the clients to come on board.

How many active clients do you currently have and where do you want to see by 2024 end?

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/rajasthan-2023-change-of-guard-end-of-gehlot-raje-era/articleshow/106395935.cms,"JAIPUR: For 25 years, Rajasthan saw just two people occupying the chief minister's post. Beginning 1998, when Congress leader Ashok Gehlot became the CM, power alternated between him and the BJP's Vasundhara Raje. The state moved on from them on December 15, when Bhajan Lal Sharma was sworn in as the new CM after the Bharatiya Janata Party won the assembly polls -- bagging 115 of the 199 seats on which the elections were held. The Congress got 69.

Raje was seen to be in the race again with several newly elected BJP MLAs calling on her in what appeared to be a show of support. Instead, the party's top leadership chose low-profile Sharma for the job.

Diya Kumari, a member of Jaipur's erstwhile royal family, and Prem Chand Bairwa, a Dalit leader, were appointed deputy chief ministers.

Gehlot spent 2023 in trying to ensure that the Congress leadership picked him as the CM choice, should the party win.

The state government's ""mehangai rahat camps"" publicised welfare schemes launched by his government, including the sale of cooking gas cylinders for Rs 500 to families under the Ujjwala scheme.

In 2023, his government also enhanced the Chiranjeevi health insurance scheme, offering medical treatment worth Rs 25 lakh per year to its beneficiaries.
Rajasthan Cabinet Expansion: Kirodi Lal Meena, Rajyavardhan Rathore take oath as ministers in Bhajan Lal Sharma govt
As part of Rajasthan Cabinet expansion, Kirodi Lal Meena, Gajendra Singh Khimsar, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Babulal Kharadi, Madan Dilawar, Jogaram Patel, Suresh Singh Rawat, Joraram Kumawat, Kanhaiya Lal Chaudhary, Sumit Godara, Sanjay Sharma, Gautam Kumar Daak, Jhawar Singh Kharra, Surendra Pal Singh on Saturday took oath as ministers in Bhajan Lal Sharma-led state government. Governor Kalraj Mishra will administer the oath.

But the leadership tussle between Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot continued to sap the party's strength in the state.

Pilot held protests against ""lack of action"" against ""corruption"" during the previous BJP government, and over the more recent paper leaks in state government recruitment exams.

He held a day-long fast and also took out a foot march from Ajmer to Jaipur, indirectly targeting the Gehlot government. There was speculation that he might float his own party.

But the party's top leadership brought about a truce between the two factions ahead of the November elections. Still, Pilot appeared to focus only on a few seats during the campaign.

In the election year, Gehlot faced much opposition flak over crime against women. In Bhilwara, a 14-year-old girl was allegedly gang-raped, murdered and her body burnt in a coal furnace. Seven people were arrested.

In Pratapgarh district, a 21-year-old tribal woman was paraded naked by her husband and in-laws, and a disturbing video surfaced online. Gehlot met the victim, who was also offered a government job.

Another sensational crime took place in Jaipur after the elections.

Two assailants shot dead Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena leader Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi in his living room. They also killed an ""accomplice"" who had helped them gain access to his home in Jaipur.

On Facebook, gangster Rohit Godara, who is linked to the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, claimed responsibility. The attack triggered protests by the Rajput community in several parts of the state.

Coaching hub Kota continued to report suicides by students.

Compared to 15 in the previous year, 26 students killed themselves in 2023, raising concern over the level of stress among young people aspiring for admission to top medical and engineering colleges.

The authorities announced various guidelines for coaching institutes and hostels to break the trend.

These included more time off and regular counselling sessions for students. Even installing spring-loaded ceiling fans was proposed, to make hanging from them ""impossible"".

A ""red diary"" created a buzz.

The episode began with the sacking of Rajendra Gudha as a minister after he attacked his own government over crime against women.

Following his termination, Gudha claimed he possessed a ""'red diary"" that he had secured during an income tax raid at the house of Congress leader Dharmendra Rathore. The ""diary"" was often mentioned by the BJP during the poll campaign, even if its actual existence hasn't been proved.

Congress leaders like party's state unit chief Govind Singh Dotasra and CM's son Vaibhav Gehlot came under the Enforcement Directorate, prompting the party to accuse the BJP-led Centre of misusing central agencies.

The ED also acted against suspended Rajasthan Public Service Commission member Babu Lal Katara in connection with the paper leak case. Katara was earlier arrested by Rajasthan Police.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/inside-the-2024-shopping-bag-where-is-the-indian-consumer-headed/articleshow/106465628.cms,"The consumer landscape shifted noticeably in India in 2023 as inflation, agricultural distress, downtrading, aspirational buying and premiumisation defined the consumption patterns. Urban markets have been the drivers of growth with modern trade and ecommerce leading the way as consumers at the lower end hesitated to spend while the affluent splurged on premium goods. Yet, green shoots of recovery were seen too amid hopes of a revival in overall consumption in 2024.

The story of 2023 consumption

Companies saw promise among the affluent buyers as those at the lower end struggled with inflation and rural distress. Luxury apartments, fancy cars and top-end consumer goods flew off the shelves. Malls and restaurants were full while hotel rooms were pricier than ever amid surging demand. Meanwhile, FMCG companies looked on enviously, unable to sell as much biscuits, soaps, shampoos and perfumes as they would like.

Those not impacted by the pandemic ploughed their extra savings into the stock market and while indices did plunge at the start of the Covid wave, they reaped rich rewards subsequently, ET has explained recently. The wealth effect of the booming stock markets could be driving top-end consumption. The borrowing binge — housing, personal and consumer loans — could also be fuelling demand as younger consumers shed the conservatism of the past.

The lower end of the income spectrum, more impacted by the pandemic, did not see a swift recovery amid high inflation. A patchy monsoon has also slowed rural recovery. Rural India, which accounts for nearly 40% of the overall market of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), saw a noticeable drop in demand for a year due to inflation and erratic monsoons. It is the demand in cities that led the overall growth as urban incomes were more resilient and had better wage inflation. Rural FMCG sales expansion was about 6% in July-September 2023, y-o-y, while the urban sales volume grew by 8%. This was in sharp contrast to what had happened before the pandemic.

""Mass end consumers earning Rs 10-15 lakh annually comprise 70% of the consumer goods market which is registering a degrowth. No one is investing in the mass end of production owing to this drop in growth and everyone is focusing on where the growth is at the premium end. However, it is important for this huge chunk of the market to grow in future for the overall economy to be sustainable"" Kamal Nandi, business head and executive vice president – Godrej Appliances, told ET two months ago. Companies too have shifted focus to marketing the higher-end products which offer better profit realisations. ""Inequality is playing out. Wherever there has been recovery, it's either been heavily biased towards the more affluent and upper-middle tiers or where it has been mass-based, there has been downtrading,"" Abheek Barua, chief economist, HDFC Bank, had told ET.

While volume growth for the FMCG industry in urban India had been on a positive trajectory since April-June 2022, rural markets grew marginally in 2023, according to market researcher NielsenIQ. In the September quarter, urban markets grew 10.2% year-on-year while rural grew 6.4%, it said. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, rural markets were driving overall growth, growing twice as fast as urban markets.

The overall FMCG demand, however, has been on the rise, although at a slow pace, and entirely driven by volume. The overall volume growth for July-September 2023, y-o-y, was 7.2%. Companies said a fall in inflation due to the base effect and a recent decline in unemployment figures, among other factors, could lead to demand recovering in the hinterland.

What does 2024 hold?

Will 2024 continue with the consumer trends of 2023? Many experts as well as industry executives do not believe so. A chief reason is the shoots of recovery seen in 2023 which can well lead to revival as inflation softens. Recently, the RBI researchers pointed out that the CPI-based retail inflation is expected to ease to 4.6 per cent in the first three quarters of 2024-25 from 5.6 per cent in November. ""The recurrence of food price spikes in November has punctured a brief respite in September and October. It is expected that these pressures will linger on into December before the usual winter softening sets in and dispels these adversities,"" the researchers said in an article.

2024 will also bring a major boost to consumption as it is the year of the general elections. The Lok Sanha elections not only mean increased spending in the interiors of the country due to poll campaigns but also a likely showering of freebies and welfare benefits by the governments before the polls which would mean more money on the hands of the buyers, especially in the hinterland where the targeted beneficiaries of such schemes live.

Deflation as well as increased rurals spending by the government and expenditure by political parties on poll campaigns are expected to lead to a recovery in consumption in rural areas. In addition, the premiumisation trend is also likely to strengthen.

Upcoming general elections and further reduction in inflation will help revive consumer demand across categories from grocery to apparel to electronics from March-April onwards, with rural markets and mass-segment products already showing signs of recovery, chief executives of several leading companies have told ET recently. Consumer goods companies were earlier expecting demand to recover in the December quarter. While that hasn't materialised, chief executives said slowdown in consumption has come to a halt and that sales of mass-segment products are picking up after a gap of over three years.

""Price-led growth has tapered off in the industry and volumes are driving growth,"" Neeraj Khatri, chief executive (India business) of Wipro Consumer Care, the maker of Santoor soap, told ET recently. ""This should put industry on a better pedestal next year. Monsoon has been decent, so is government spending. It's also time for rural people to come out from the debt (they had to avail) during Covid.""

The months of May and June are the time when companies expect discretionary spending to pick up, mainly due to the overall spike in spending in the economy due to the general elections. “The general elections and increased government spending before that will put more money into the hands of consumers, boosting discretionary spending,” Devaranjan Iyer, CEO of departmental store chain Lifestyle International, has told ET. “Also, by then, we expect the huge spends on experience such as leisure and travel will normalise and consumers will shift their spending from buying experience to products,” he said.

The FMCG companies expect a double-digit volume-led growth in the new year, the PTI has reported. They expect 2024 to be a better year with favourable input prices benefitting the home and personal care as well as certain food business segments. ""We expect the demand situation to improve as we enter the next financial year. We expect FMCG players to increase the pace of innovation and premiumisation and also focus on significant investment behind expanding the quality of rural distribution,"" Marico MD and CEO Saugata Gupta told PTI recently.

Consumers are expected to keep buying more of local brands in 2024. As inflation goes down and input prices weaker in 2024, the rise of local and regional brands is likely to continue. These brands scaled up rapidly to give tougher competition to national brands after outpacing them to post double-digit sales growth in the two quarters of the current financial year.

As small towns rise on India's consumption map, companies can expect more consumers shopping online especially for premium products since the hinterland has been underserved by traditional retail in categories such as apparel, electronics and jewellery. At the end of 2023, even as offline retail operated at full strength, more than 50% of total festive sales came through online platforms against 45% in 2022, consulting firm Grant Thornton Bharat estimated. According to data from Unicommerce, online retail registered 22% growth in terms of gross merchandise value, driven by sales of high-value items in large categories such as smartphones and appliances, aided by financing options through marketplaces and their lending partners. These trends are expected to only strengthen in 2024.

Kellen, allegedly involved in scheduling the abusive ""massages"" conducted by Epstein, is speculated to possess a wealth of insider information that could potentially extricate her from legal ramifications. Sources close to Kellen and her husband, Brian Vickers, hinted at her preparedness for this disclosure, suggesting she holds revelations that could shock the world.

Kellen, who held a significant role in Epstein’s operations for years, is bracing herself as Manhattan federal Judge Loretta Preska ruled for the unsealing of documents in the new year. Among the prominent figures expected to be disclosed are former President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, implicating them in Epstein's activities. Despite her alleged involvement in Epstein's exploitation of underage girls, Kellen has maintained a low profile since Epstein’s death and Ghislaine Maxwell’s subsequent conviction.

Living in a secure Miami Beach residence, Kellen and Vickers have deliberately crafted a lifestyle that shields them from unwanted attention and legal repercussions. Speculation arises regarding Kellen’s potential to reveal her insights through a tell-all book, yet she opts to keep her knowledge as a bargaining chip for self-preservation.

While Kellen has not faced criminal charges, her name surfaced in documents from a 2015 lawsuit filed by Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre against Maxwell. Testimonies from Maxwell’s trial further highlighted Kellen's active role in arranging abusive appointments. Despite this, Kellen remains tight-lipped, refraining from commenting on these developments.

The impending release of court documents on January 2nd is anticipated to unveil not only individuals associated with Epstein but also numerous victims and accomplices linked to his heinous crimes. As the world braces for this unveiling, Kellen and others implicated in the scandal await the potential fallout from this long-awaited disclosure.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/uk/nhs-gears-up-for-record-breaking-junior-doctors-strike-amidst-government-stand-off/articleshow/106490531.cms,"In what could be the longest strike in its 75-year history, the NHS braces for a six-day walkout by junior doctors, scheduled to commence this week. Starting Wednesday at 7 am until 7 am on January 9, the strike duration spans an unprecedented 144 consecutive hours. Concerns loom large as NHS England's medical director, Professor Sir Stephen Powis, forewarns of an exceedingly challenging start to the year for the health service.

""Six consecutive days of industrial action comes at one of our busiest periods,"" remarked Prof. Powis, highlighting the potential repercussions on planned care amidst the compounding seasonal pressures of Covid, flu, and staff shortages due to illness. Acknowledging the dedication of health service personnel, he emphasized the challenges ahead, stating that the impact wouldn't be confined to the immediate week but would ripple into subsequent weeks as services recover and handle increased demand.

The possibility of a resolution seems bleak, as expressed by NHS Confederation chief executive Matthew Taylor, who described the situation as a regrettable standoff. Taylor noted that negotiations hinge on the junior doctors calling off the strike, while the government's participation depends on increased investment—an impasse leading to what is anticipated to be severely damaging days for the NHS.

The British Medical Association (BMA), representing junior doctors, points to record high workloads and waiting lists juxtaposed with a 26% decline in their pay over the past 15 years as the crux of their agitation. Despite the ongoing strike action, the Department of Health and Social Care urges the BMA to reconsider, emphasizing the distress caused to patients due to canceled appointments and procedures. A plea for a return to negotiations is underlined, with the hope of finding a fair resolution to resume focus on patient care.

The Government has allocated £800 million to mitigate the impact on patient care during this winter period, aiming to safeguard critical services like emergency treatment, neonatal care, and cancer surgery. Despite these efforts, the imminent strike threatens to strain the NHS's resources, with concerns about the welfare of patients at the forefront of discussions between the authorities and the striking doctors.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/aquaman-3-a-watery-future-director-james-wan-speaks-on-sequel-prospects/articleshow/106490328.cms,"As the aquatic spectacle of ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom"" continues to make waves, the burning question on many fans' minds is whether the journey will extend into ""Aquaman 3."" Director James Wan has shed light on the prospects of a sequel, revealing that the fate of the third installment hinges on specific conditions.

Warner Bros. strategically positioned ""Aquaman 2"" as the culmination of the DCEU's decade-long narrative, leaving fans to ponder if Wan would be granted the opportunity to helm ""Aquaman 3"" within James Gunn and Peter Safran's revamped DCU.

Jason Momoa, the charismatic star of the Aquaman series, weighed in on the potential tone of a third installment, expressing skepticism about a lighthearted approach, stating, ""I highly doubt it. I'm too dramatic."" This comment hinted at a departure from the lighter elements of the previous film.

James Wan, the creative force behind the aquatic adventures, outlined his conditions for returning to helm ""Aquaman 3"" during an interview with Empire Magazine. Wan emphasized that his willingness to undertake another Aquaman film would be contingent on maintaining the creative freedom he enjoyed in the first two installments.

Uncertain about the franchise's trajectory under Gunn and Safran, Wan stated, ""I haven’t directed a third movie [in a series] before, so I’d be open to doing another ['Aquaman'] if I got the same freedom I’ve had on these first two. I’m not sure what direction [Gunn and Safran] are going in, though, so who knows? I’ve learned to never say never.""

This revelation underscores the delicate balance between creative vision and the collaborative nature of blockbuster franchises. Wan's desire for artistic freedom aligns with his successful stewardship of the Aquaman saga thus far, emphasizing the importance of maintaining that dynamic moving forward.

James Gunn, DC Studios co-CEO, hinted at the interconnected nature of characters and storylines within the DCU but provided no explicit mention of Aquaman's role in the evolving narrative. Gunn stated, ""Some actors will be playing characters they’ve played in other stories & some plot points might be consistent with plot points from the dozens of films, shows & animated projects that have come from DC in the past. But nothing is canon until 'CC' and 'Legacy.'""

The uncertainty surrounding the direction of the DCU adds an element of intrigue to the fate of ""Aquaman 3."" As Wan contemplates the potential for a third chapter, fans remain on the edge of their seats, eagerly awaiting the revelation of whether the aquatic hero will resurface for another cinematic adventure. The waters of possibility are vast, and only time will unveil the fate of Aquaman's cinematic odyssey.

FAQs:
Will there be Aquaman 3?
Currently, there are no concrete plans for a third installment, and the trajectory of the franchise appears uncertain. ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom"" stands as the concluding film in DC's Extended Universe before an impending hard reboot orchestrated by James Gunn and Peter Safran.

Is Aquaman married to Mera?
Mera, the former Queen of Dimension Aqua and Atlantis holds the esteemed title of being the wife of the DC Comics superhero Aquaman. Additionally, Mera has a twin sister named Hila, whose path diverges toward villainy.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/work/decoding-us-new-rule-allowing-stem-students-on-opt-to-work-for-startups/articleshow/106481662.cms,"For international students on an F-1 visa in the United States, the STEM OPT extension program provides an opportunity to gain valuable work experience after graduation while extending their stay in the US for a chance of an H-1B lottery win. Concomitantly, the program is invaluable for US employers in facilitating access to well-qualified workers, most with graduate degrees.

The process of STEM OPT extensions is relatively straightforward, but the rules for working for startups can be perplexing. Under the STEM OPT program, employers must pay their employees a base salary equal to or greater than those paid to other similarly employed US workers. This salary requirement protects both the US workers and the STEM OPT students. However, the rules and policies governing legal compensation for employment with startups can be unclear and complex. This lack of clarity exists because startups often use stocks and stock options as a part of their compensation packages, which raises questions about how to value this type of compensation and how it should be treated under the STEM OPT program.

In 2016, the USCIS mentioned the possibility of an exception to the base salary rule for STEM OPT workers employed by startups. This exception, the USCIS referred to as “alternative compensation,” would allow startups to provide compensation that includes stock and stock options, as long as the compensation is commensurate with the compensation provided to other similarly situated US workers. However, the USCIS did not give any further guidance on how to value or treat this type of compensation. According to the USCIS:

“...F–1 students seeking STEM OPT extensions may be employed by new “startup” businesses so long as all regulatory requirements are met, including that the employer adheres to the training plan requirements, remains in good standing with E-Verify, will provide compensation to the STEM OPT student commensurate to that provided to similarly situated U.S. workers, and has the resources to comply with the proposed training plan. For instance, alternative compensation may be allowed during a STEM OPT extension as long as the F–1 student can show that he or she is a bona fide employee and that his or her compensation, including any ownership interest in the employer entity (such as stock options), is commensurate with the compensation provided to other similarly situated U.S. workers.”

(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates)


This is all that the USCIS has said about alternative compensation. The obvious lack of guidance has left many questions unanswered. For example, how should the value of stock options be calculated for a startup still in its formative phases? What is an acceptable method for valuing unvested stock options? What type of documentation must the employer maintain to demonstrate these valuations? None of these questions can be answered clearly and thoroughly.

Another crucial question that has not been answered is whether a STEM OPT student can create their own startup and be a majority or minority stockholder while also working for the startup as a STEM OPT worker. This is a particularly important question for international students who have entrepreneurial aspirations and want to build their own companies.

Without clear guidance from the USCIS, it is up to STEM OPT students and their startup employers to navigate these issues. To ensure good faith compliance with the OPT program requirements, employers should maintain the best possible commercially feasible documentation. Among other matters, it is essential to carefully evaluate the compensation package and clearly document the value and valuation methodology of the alternative compensation.

On the positive side, several indications and overtures from the Whitehouse and the USCIS recognize the national importance of the STEM fields and an inclination to provide wider opportunities for students, workers, and researchers in these fields. These indications include widening the STEM fields eligible for the STEM OPT extension, Executive Orders specifically acknowledging US interests and urging government agencies to exercise their discretion in favor of STEM professionals, and formally amending policy and regulations to accommodate these professionals.

These indications are encouraging because the US government is apparently inclined to be more accommodating than usually expected when there is a lack of clarity in their own policy. With meticulous planning, the benefits of the STEM OPT program can continue to be harvested without violating any USCIS policies.

Will elections significantly influence or change the trajectory of markets?

“General elections are at best a transient event risk. Historically, we have seen that while there tends to be some volatility in the run-up to elections, markets tend to follow the underlying fair value over the medium to long term,” says Vinay Paharia, CIO, at PGIM India Mutual Fund. He oversees assets over Rs 20,300 crore at the asset management firm.

While from a valuation perspective, Paharia is cautiously optimistic on the market, he remains positive over the medium term, as India appears to be an oasis of green from a global top-down perspective. Edited excerpts from an interview with ETMarkets:



The equity funds of PGIM India MF have underperformed their respective benchmarks in 2023. The primary reason for this has been that in recent years, good quality and high growth companies have significantly underperformed their weaker counterparts.

This trend got further accelerated in 2023. However, over the long term (5 years and more), stock prices have performed in line with the underlying growth in earnings.

Similarly, higher RoE companies have delivered higher returns compared to their weaker counterparts over a five-year period.


We remain cautiously optimistic on the market from a medium term perspective. Our caution is because markets are trading at a premium to its current fair value. However, this fair value is likely to grow at a strong pace in the medium term, hence we remain optimistic.


We cannot comment on the near-term outlook for the markets. However, from a medium term perspective, India appears to be an oasis of green from a global top-down perspective.

Growth in India is strong, inflation is under control, currency and bond markets are stable. This is in stark contrast to the global developed world, where macro is weak, economies are slowing down, interest rates are elevated, inflation is sticky and fiscal pressure is growing.

Over a 3-year time horizon, we expect corporate fair values to mildly outpace nominal GDP growth, led by operating and financial leverage. Stable economy, consistent government policies, rising household income and favourable demographics will continue to drive FII flows into India from a medium to longer term perspective.


The share of financial savings in Indian household savings has been on the rise at the expense of physical assets over the past few years. This has been a key factor for the rise in DII inflows and this structural factor is expected to continue over the medium to longer term.

FII flows, on the other hand, would be a function of multiple factors, including global interest rates, conditions and relative attractiveness of India versus other investment destinations.

Thus, while DII inflows into equity markets could be structural trend, it surpassing FII inflows by a wide margin as what was seen in 2023 might not be sustainable.


We are positive on sectors that are linked to domestic consumption. We expect consumer discretionary, healthcare and financial sectors to do well in 2024.


General elections are at best a transient event risk. Historically, we have seen that while there tends to be some volatility in the run-up to elections, markets tend to follow the underlying fair value over the medium to long term.


Currently, midcaps and smallcaps in general are expensive. Weak (low growth low quality) midcaps and smallcaps are in a bubble zone and caution is advised. Strong (high growth good quality) midcaps and smallcaps present an opportunity for long term investors.


On a relative basis, we are finding more comfort in largecaps versus mid- and smallcaps from a valuation perspective. Having said that, within each of the categories, we continue to find good quality high growth companies which are available at reasonable valuations.

These companies could see strong growth in their fair value over a medium to longer term perspective and, hence, could offer reasonable returns over a 3-5 year time horizon."

The speculations were triggered by the Enforcement Directorate's recent summons to Chief Minister Hemant Soren coupled with the sudden resignation by JMM's Gandey legislator Sarfaraz Ahmad on Monday.

The opposition BJP has alleged that Ahmad was made to quit so that the chief minister's wife Kalpana Soren could contest the Gandey seat in case of ED's action against Soren.

""A meeting of the legislators of alliance partners has been convened at 4.30 pm at the chief minister's residence on January 3. Please ensure timely participation in the meeting,"" Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) general secretary Vinod Kumar Pandey wrote to ministers of the alliance parties and legislators on Tuesday.

JMM sources said the meeting has been convened to discuss the present political scenario in the backdrop of ED's summons to Soren as well as to chalk out a strategy.

Ahmad's sudden resignation without citing any reason has sparked off speculations that Soren might step down and anoint his wife Kalpana Soren as the chief minister and she may contest from the vacant seat.

The ED in its latest summons to Soren, who is also the executive president of JMM, has asked him to to inform the investigating officer about the date, venue, and time of his choice so that his statement could be recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

The probe pertains to a ""huge racket of illegal change of ownership of land by the mafia"" in Jharkhand, according to the ED.

Soren has skipped six earlier summonses by ED accusing the union government of using central agencies to destabilise the democratically elected state government. The seventh summons was issued in December last year.

He had filed petitions before the Supreme Court and Jharkhand High Court seeking protection from ED's actions, terming the summonses ""unwarranted"". Both courts dismissed his petitions.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/india-bangladesh-trade-down-in-pre-election-season/articleshow/106487271.cms,"The India-Bangladesh bilateral trade, already strained by economic headwinds during the year, has dampened in some land ports due to the upcoming general elections in the neighbouring country, exporters said on Tuesday. Bangladesh is set to hold its 12th general election on January 7 and the pre-election atmosphere has cast a shadow on the cross-border trade.

Indian exports to Bangladesh between April and October 2023 declined by 13.32 per cent, while imports saw a marginally smaller 2.3 per cent dip, according to data from the Department of Commerce.

""Trade activity has been affected for some time now due to Bangladesh's forex shortages and liquidity crunch. The election-related slowdown is expected to be temporary, but stricter rules like the 110 per cent margin on letters of credit compared to the earlier 10 per cent have been a major concern for traders,"" a commodity exporter told PTI on condition of anonymity.

Stakeholders point to the general slowdown in trade activity during elections as a natural phenomenon due to factors like tighter border controls, heightened risk aversion among businesses, and the potential for disruptions like protests and shortage of labourers who go back to their hometowns for voting.

The impact is particularly acute in West Bengal's border town of Bangaon near the Petrapol border, where local markets heavily rely on Bangladeshi tourists, they said.

""Export activity, especially of construction materials like stone chips, has slowed down due to the elections,"" said Prasonjit Ghosh of Malda's Malhadipur Exporters' Association.

Fly ash exports via the Indo-Bangladesh protocol route through Kolkata port have also witnessed a 15-25 per cent drop during the peak construction season, highlighting the broader impact on construction material trade.

""There's been a temporary slowdown due to the election mode, but we expect trade to bounce back to normal after the polls,"" said Sajedur Rahman of the Benapole C&F Agents Association.

Although Petrapole cargo truck movement data shows no major trade disruptions, the number of trucks moving between December 21 and 31 had been quite erratic due to holidays. However, passenger movement, particularly inbound traffic, had reduced significantly.

The inflow to India through Petrapole reduced to 2141 passengers on December 31 from 2894 on December 21, Petrapole Land Port Manager Kamlesh Saini said.

Binay Sinha, secretary of the Bangoan Chamber of Commerce, pinpointed the stark impact of the Bangladeshi elections on Bangoan's three local markets: Taw Market, Motilal Market, and New Market.

""Visa issuance restrictions imposed by Bangladesh except for medical treatment on its citizens during the election period drastically reduced tourist flow,"" Sinha elaborated.

""These markets heavily rely on Bangladeshi tourists who purchase goods in India before returning home but these local markets are not closed,"" he said.

Adding to the woes, ""informal trade channels have also come to a standstill during the elections, further squeezing these markets"", a local trader said.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/rafael-nadal-makes-stunning-comeback-at-brisbane-international-ahead-of-potential-farewell-season/articleshow/106487144.cms,"Rafael Nadal emerged with a triumphant return following nearly a year's absence due to injury, showcasing an outstanding performance at the Brisbane International by securing victory over Dominic Thiem. The 37-year-old, away from the singles scene since his defeat at the Australian Open 349 days ago, displayed exceptional resilience in a commanding 7-5 6-1 win. Amidst speculation surrounding his potential retirement, this season might serve as a defining juncture for the 22-time Grand Slam champion.

Utilizing the Brisbane tournament as a stepping stone to regain momentum ahead of the upcoming Australian Open, where he obtained a wildcard entry, Nadal indicated his determination to reclaim his competitive spirit. With the Australian Open slated to begin on January 14th in Melbourne, all eyes turn to this event, which could hold significant weight in the narrative of Nadal's illustrious career.

Post-victory, Nadal articulated his sentiments, remarking, ""Today holds immense emotional weight. It has been one of the most challenging years in my tennis journey."" Expressing acknowledgment of pre-match jitters and uncertainties stemming from his injury, he conveyed his sheer joy at being back on the court.

Nadal's absence traces back to the demanding phase during the 2023 Australian Open, where injury setbacks contributed to his loss against Mackenzie McDonald. Subsequently, a surgical procedure on his left hip in June resulted in a notable decline in his world ranking, now standing at 672nd.

Teaming up with compatriot Marc Lopez for a doubles match served as Nadal's initial step in his comeback journey before facing Dominic Thiem in singles. Despite the extended break, Nadal showcased his unwavering serve dominance, winning an impressive 21 of his opening 24 service points.

The intensity and agility that define Nadal's gameplay were evident, particularly with his strategic breakthrough in the 12th game of the first set, setting the tempo for the match. He continued his commanding performance in the second set, securing a substantial lead with successive breaks against Thiem.

Previously hinting at a potential retirement at the end of the season, Nadal displayed a renewed passion for the sport after his return, refraining from definitively confirming that this season would mark his departure.

Nadal's return holds profound significance, especially considering his previous tie with Novak Djokovic for the most men's major triumphs. Djokovic's subsequent victories at the French Open and US Open last year propelled him to 24 Grand Slam titles, intensifying the narrative surrounding men's tennis.

Positive chart pattern like higher tops and bottoms is intact on the daily chart and present consolidation/weakness is in line with the formation of new higher bottoms of the sequence. The bottom reversal needs to be confirmed at the lows. A slide below the immediate support of 21500 could open some more weakness for the near term. A sustainable move above 21840 could bring bulls back into the action, Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said.

Open Interest (OI) data showed the highest OI on the call side at 21,800 level, followed by 22,000 strike prices. On the put side, the highest OI was observed at 21,500 strike price. This data provides insights into the levels where options traders have the greatest exposure.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) which settled at the 72 level indicates a marginal loss of momentum.

What should traders do? Here’s what analysts said:


A bearish candle has emerged on the daily Nifty chart, indicating a potential bearish trend in the near future. Sentiment is expected to stay bearish as long as it remains below 21750. Any upward movement toward 21750 could encounter selling pressure. However, a clear breakout above 21750 could shift sentiment in favor of the bulls. Support is established at 21500 on the lower end.


The underperformance of the banking majors is largely weighing on the sentiment amid consolidation and a decisive close above 21,800 in Nifty would prompt the next leg of the up move. Meanwhile, we feel it is prudent to prefer defensive viz. FMCG, pharma and stay selective in others."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/sound-of-freedom-movie-controversies-allegations-and-streaming-future-explained/articleshow/106456476.cms,"""Sound of Freedom,"" a surprise summer box office hit starring Jim Caviezel, is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, reigniting controversies that surrounded its theatrical release. The film, which follows the real-life story of Tim Ballard, a former special agent rescuing children from sex traffickers, generated both acclaim and criticism. Let's delve into the controversies and allegations surrounding ""Sound of Freedom.""

Accuracy in Portrayal of Child Trafficking
One of the primary points of contention revolves around the film's portrayal of child trafficking. Experts, including Erin Albright, a former fellow for the Department of Justice's anti-trafficking task force, argue that the depiction is inaccurate and sensationalized. Albright contends that the movie presents a dramatic perspective, often involving strangers, whereas real trafficking situations are often more complex and involve known individuals.

The concern lies in how the public perceives the crime, as the film's portrayal may contribute to a misunderstanding of trafficking dynamics. While acknowledging that events depicted in the movie can and do happen, critics emphasize the need for a nuanced understanding of the issue.

Association with Conspiracy Theories
""Sound of Freedom"" faced additional scrutiny due to its perceived support from far-wing groups, including QAnon. Despite public praise from right-wing figures, including former President Donald Trump, the movie itself denies any explicit references to QAnon or conspiracy theories. Angel Studios' CEO emphasized the film's apolitical nature, stating, ""This film is not about conspiracy theories. It’s not about politics.""

Director Alejandro Monteverde and star Jim Caviezel have distanced the film from conspiracy theories, expressing dismay at the controversy. However, Caviezel and Tim Ballard, the film's inspiration, faced accusations of making QAnon references or showing support, fueling the controversy further.

Allegations Toward Filmmakers/Creators
Post-release, serious allegations emerged against the creators, producers, and Tim Ballard. While Ballard denied QAnon connections, he faced accusations of sexual assault and misconduct during missions with Operation Underground Railroad (OUR), leading to his removal from the organization and excommunication from the Mormon church.

Producer Paul Hutchinson and film funder Fabian Marta faced separate accusations of inappropriate behavior, including child kidnapping, although the latter charges were dropped and deemed a family misunderstanding.

Sound of Freedom's Streaming Future
With the film now available for streaming, discussions around ""Sound of Freedom"" are expected to persist. Despite controversies, the film has the opportunity to reach a broader audience. However, it cannot escape the scrutiny surrounding Tim Ballard's record and reputation, given the recent allegations and organizational changes.

The controversies surrounding ""Sound of Freedom"" highlight broader issues concerning the depiction of sensitive topics in films. As audiences engage with the movie on streaming platforms, the ongoing conversation prompts reflection on how future films address critical issues, balancing entertainment with responsible storytelling.

In the aftermath of the summer blockbuster's backlash, the hope is that future films take cues on responsibly educating audiences while avoiding pitfalls related to politics and conspiracies. ""Sound of Freedom"" is now accessible on Amazon Prime Video, inviting viewers to form their own perspectives amid the surrounding controversies.

FAQs
What is the controversy over Sound of Freedom?
Sound of Freedom has found itself entangled in controversy, largely due to its endorsement by far-right groups, including the fringe conspiracy collective QAnon. The film delves into the theory of a global sex trafficking ring allegedly orchestrated by world elites, intertwining it with a narrative suggesting a plot against former United States President Donald Trump.

Is Sound of Freedom Based on a True Story?
Sound of Freedom takes significant creative liberties in portraying the real-life persona of Tim Ballard. Ballard, a Mormon with a self-proclaimed background in working with the CIA (yet to be confirmed according to a Vice investigation) and Homeland Security, established Operation Underground Railroad (OUR) in 2013. His motivation was a perceived need to contribute more actively to the fight against human trafficking.

The 'Request for Quotation' (RFQ) outlines tender process terms, eligibility requirements, and submission process. It requires a payment of Rs 1 lakh plus goods and services tax and will be available until January 19.

The BCCI stated that interested parties must acquire the RFQ, meet the eligibility criteria, and agree to the terms and conditions to bid, as purchasing does not grant the eligibility to bid. The BCCI has also prohibited certain categories from bidding for official partnership rights.

The list includes alcohol products, betting, cryptocurrency, real money gaming, tobacco, financial services, passenger vehicles, tyres, tubes, & flaps, beverages, and any category likely to offend public morals.

BCCI said it reserves the right to cancel or amend the bidding process at any stage without providing any reason. Currently, the WPL's sponsors include Tata Group, Ceat, Dream11, and Amul Kool.

BCCI secured over Rs 200 crore from the four sponsorship deals earlier this year, with Tata Group serving as the title sponsor for five years and the other three companies as official partners for three years.

In January, the BCCI had raked in about Rs 4,670 crore from the sale of five franchises for WPL. The five franchises include Adani Sportsline (Ahmedabad), Reliance Industries (Mumbai), Diageo (Bengaluru), JSW GMR Cricket (Delhi), and Capri Global Holdings (Lucknow).

Viacom18 had bought the WPL media rights for a record Rs 951 crore till 2027.

A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta refused to grant any interim relief to the petitioners who have challenged the caste survey and the Patna High Court order upholding the Bihar government's decision to conduct such an exercise.

""There is no question of interim relief as they (the government) have a high court order in their favour. Now that the data has been put in public domain, there are two-three aspects which remain. First is the legal issue-correctness of the high court judgement and legality of such an exercise,"" the bench said.

Senior advocate Raju Ramachandaran, appearing for the petitioners, said since the survey data is out, the authorities have started implementing it in the interim and raised the reservation for SCs, STs, Other Backward Classes, Extremely Backward Classes, and Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) to a total of 75 per cent from the existing 50 per cent.

The bench said this issue needs to be heard at length.

""As far as increasing the reservation is concerned, you have to challenge it before the high court,"" the bench told Ramachandaran, who said it has already been contested before the high court.

Ramachandaran said the issue is important, and since the state government is acting upon the data, the matter be listed next week so that the petitioners can argue for interim relief.

""What interim relief? They (the Bihar government) have a high court judgement in their favour,"" the bench said.

Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for the Bihar government, said the data, including the break-up, has been put in the public domain and anyone can see it on the designated website.

Justice Khanna said, ""What I am more worried about is the availability of break-up of data. To what extent the government can withhold the data. You see, the entire break-up of data should be in the public domain so that anyone can challenge the inference drawn from it. Unless it is in the public domain, they can't challenge it.""

The BJP, the main opposition party in Bihar, has accused the Nitish Kumar government of irregularities in conducting the caste survey and called the data collected ""fake"".

The bench then asked Divan to file a report on the caste survey and posted the matter for further hearing on February 5.

On October 6, 2023, the top court had questioned the Bihar government as to why it published its caste survey data. It had, however, refused to restrain the state government from making public further data, and said it may examine if the state has the power to conduct such an exercise.

It had issued a formal notice on a batch of pleas challenging the August 1, 2023 order of the Patna High Court that gave the go-ahead for the caste survey in Bihar.

It rejected the petitioners' contention that the state government has already published some data preempting a stay. They had sought a complete stay on further publication of data.

On October 2, 2023, the Nitish Kumar government had released the findings of the caste survey, a move its detractors claimed was made keeping in mind the 2024 Parliamentary elections.

The data revealed that the OBCs and EBCs constituted a whopping 63 per cent of the state's population.

According to the data released, the state's total population stood at a little over 13.07 crore, out of which the Extremely Backward Classes (36 per cent) were the largest social segment followed by the Other Backward Classes at 27.13 per cent.

The survey also said the Yadavs, the OBC group to which Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav belongs, were the largest caste in terms of population, accounting for 14.27 per cent of the total.

Dalits accounted for 19.65 per cent of the total population in the state, which is also home to nearly 22 lakh (1.68 per cent) people belonging to the Scheduled Tribes.

On August 7, 2023, the top court had refused to stay the high court's order giving the go-ahead for the caste survey.

Besides a plea by NGO 'Ek Soch Ek Paryas', several other petitions have been filed, including one by Nalanda-resident Akhilesh Kumar, who has contended that the notification issued by the state government for the exercise is against the constitutional mandate.

Kumar's petition says, according to the constitutional mandate, only the Union government is empowered to conduct a census.

The high court had said in its 101-page verdict, ""We find the action of the state to be perfectly valid, initiated with due competence with the legitimate aim of providing development with justice.""

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/fmcg-will-continue-to-grow-but-there-will-be-a-shift-from-mass-to-niche-brands-anand-ramanathan-deloitte-india/articleshow/106483399.cms,"Anand Ramanathan, Partner, Consumer Industry Leader, Consulting, Deloitte India, says “we are seeing green shoots in rural India and retail today in India is still about two-thirds of it is food and groceries. So, food will be one of those big categories. But beyond that, while the overall retail market is expected to double by 2030, we have some categories like luxury, for example, which will grow at about 5x. We will have e-commerce grow at about 4x compared to the overall market at about 2x and hence these will be categories or segments that will grow faster than the rest of the market.”


One of the key points which caught my attention from your latest write-up is that upcoming elections could actually inject a lot more liquidity in the hands of people, especially in tier II, tier III and the rural side and that could boost sales of consumer items. What category of consumption are we talking about here and what is your hypothesis?
Anand Ramanathan: Yes, indeed, we will see high retail growth in 2024. We expect it to be about 10% to 13% and this is largely driven by an uptick in rural demand too. Urban demand had picked up, but we are seeing green shoots in rural India and retail today in India is still about two-thirds of it is food and groceries. So, food will be one of those big categories.

But beyond that, if I were to look at other categories, while the overall retail market is expected to double by 2030, we have some categories like luxury, for example, which will grow at about 5x. We will have e-commerce grow at about 4x compared to the overall market at about 2x and hence these will be categories or segments that will grow faster than the rest of the market.

We have seen that certain ticket items, especially in FMCG, have been posting very weak volume growth for several quarters now. Are there any green shoots? Even if we talk about the mid-range value retailing items, what would provide the trigger change over there?
Anand Ramanathan: FMCG as a category will continue to grow but we will see a shift from mass brands to niche brands. So, there will be D2C brands, there will be private labels. Private labels are expected to grow 6x in a period where retail is otherwise growing at 2x. White labels, we are seeing a lot of online brands, for example, do really well. So, there will be a greater penetration of some of these smaller brands which cater to micro segments and relative niches within the market and we will see more discretionary behaviour and typically discretionary behaviour promotes variety seeking and hence there is a greater number of brands and loyalty of at least consuming a few mass brands will perhaps reduce over the next few years and that is the reason for the volume sluggishness that you have seen because most of the large FMCG brands that we target are mass brands. We really do not look so closely at the smaller D2C brands or the private label brands.

The other thing which is happening is that the view that high inflation levels have also led to a lot of consumer base actually to shift downwards in value terms and in trying to adjust whatever liquidity they have, they are trying to adjust their requirements and there was a down trading happening at every category. Do you think this will continue or will it get arrested?
Anand Ramanathan: Overall we have seen the market look good, particularly rural India and hence as demand strengthens, we will see some of these pressures of inflation soften plus see 60% to 70% of an FMCG brand's cost is going to come from the cost of raw material and therefore, inflation and geopolitics and commodity prices, etc, all of it has an impact on pricing which many a times they are not able to pass on to the consumer. Some of these have also eased up a little. Hence, we will see that at least in the near term in the next three to six months, there will be some relief both in terms of attractive demand, as well as less pressure from commodity price fluctuations.

How are retailers adopting AI, analytics to ensure higher sales or even reaching the right target audience and achieve much more efficiencies and also by the use of all of this, do you see some brands, actually D2C kind of brands, achieve bigger sales?
Anand Ramanathan: I think analytics is transformative. So, there will be a lot of investments, firstly, on the foundation layers, just to have all of the data in one place whether it is customer, whether it is inventory, whether it is sales and hence, you will see foundation investments, but then comes in the real value add from analytics which is on the insights.

Now with generative AI, with machine intelligence, a lot of predictive analytics can improve performance in this sector. We will see investments both on the front end, as well as the back end of the business. On the front end, you mentioned D2C, analytics will help track what individual customer experience is and what the needs and preferences of individual customers are and hence things like personalisation, etc, can direct better conversion as well as better value for the customer. And on the back end, whether it is the supply chain, whether it is finance or looking at even people analytics, there is a lot of scope for efficiencies which will kick in into all of these different functions at the back end. So, we will see investments in analytics as one of the biggest drivers of change in the consumer sector.

Additionally, the use of gutkha, pan, plastic, and polythene has been completely banned within the temple premises starting from the New Year's day of 2024.

According to an official from the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA), devotees must wear ""decent clothes"" to enter the shrine. Attire such as half pants, shorts, torn jeans, skirts, and sleeveless dresses are not permitted.

Since the rule came into effect, male devotees have been seen wearing dhotis and towels, while women have been clad in sarees or salwar kameez, as they gathered to have a darshan of the deity on the first day of 2024.

Earlier, the SJTA had issued an order to enforce these restrictions, which are being monitored by the police. Violators of the gutkha and pan ban are being fined, as the intention is to preserve the sanctity of the temple.

Despite the restrictions, a large number of devotees have flocked to the seaside pilgrim city to seek blessings from Lord Jagannath on New Year's day. The temple doors reopened at 1.40 am, welcoming devotees who had gathered in queues along the Grand Road.

Puri Police Samarth Verma told TOI, ""More than 180,000 devotees have visited @JagannathaDhaam till 12 noon (on Monday). Along with ensuring hassle-free darshan, police are facilitating specially-abled devotees.""

To ensure a smooth darshan experience, the SJTA and police have made elaborate arrangements. An air-conditioned tensile fabric structure has been set up outside the temple, equipped with CCTV cameras, public announcement systems, drinking water facilities, public toilets, and seating arrangements.

Inspector General of Police of Central Range, Ashish Kumar Singh, reported, ""Today, the number of devotees visiting the temple has doubled compared to the same day last year. Darshan began early at 1.40 am and is still ongoing. It was momentarily halted to perform rituals related to the deities.""

The devotees are entering the temple through the air-conditioned shed, with special provisions made for senior citizens and people with disabilities. After completing their visit, devotees are exiting through the north gate.

Furthermore, the Lingaraj Temple in Bhubaneswar has also implemented a ban on the consumption of pan and tobacco products starting from Monday. Devotees found chewing tobacco or betel leaves are not allowed to enter the premises of the 11th-century Shiva temple. The use of polythene and plastic has also been banned within the temple grounds, as per the decision of the Lingaraj Temple Trust Board.

The jackpot, standing at a minimum of $20 million for the next drawing on January 3, comes after a series of 35 drawings without a winner. The odds of clinching this grand prize remain staggeringly low at 1 in 292,201,338.

Recent announcements revealed four individual tickets from California, Connecticut, Florida, and Maryland that matched all five white numbers, granting each a $1 million prize. Michigan, with its history in the game, now celebrates its seventh Powerball winner.

The anticipation for a victor grew since an unidentified person secured a hefty $1.76 million jackpot back in October. Notably, Cristy Davis claimed a $70 million prize in February 2020, though she received approximately $36 million after taxes, as reported by the Detroit News.

The dawn of 2024 heralded the initial millionaire of the year: Pamela Bradshaw of North Carolina. Amidst Dick Clark’s ""New Year’s Rockin’ Eve,"" Ryan Seacrest announced Bradshaw’s winning number, leading to an overwhelming moment as she collapsed upon hearing her number called.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/asba-mechanism-for-secondary-trade-in-equity-bleakens-prospects-for-discount-brokers/articleshow/106487806.cms,"The rollout of the Application Supported by Blocked Amount or ASBA-like facility for trading in the secondary market is likely to bode well for investors and brokers in the longer run. However, there could be a significant negative impact on brokers, particularly discount broking firms, say experts.

Trading through a blocking mechanism in the secondary market was proposed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in March and was rolled out from January 1.

The facility is based on blocking of funds for trading in the secondary market through UPI, and initially, the facility will be optional for investors as well as stock brokers.

The facility has been initially rolled out for the equity cash segment.


One of the major advantages of this mechanism is that the funds remain in the clients’ account and they have control over allowing access to only the necessary amount of money required to execute the trades.

“This enhanced level of control and security empowers traders to make informed decisions about their funds,” said Shrey Jain, founder and CEO SAS Online.

Trivesh D of Tradejini said that the ASBA-like facility in the secondary market will be suitable primarily for long-term stock investors or those conducting a limited number of trades annually.

“In the long run, this move is positive for investors since it eliminates the risk of a run on the broker, allowing investors to retain control of funds and earn savings account interest on unutilized blocked amounts,” he said.


A shift by traders to this mechanism is likely to have a significant impact on discount brokers, compared to the traditional or full-service brokers, due to their reliance on 'float income' as a substantial part of their total earnings, experts said.

Float income is the money brokers earn from customers' idle balances lying with the broker.

Safeguarding investors’ funds from operational risk at the broker’s end, and discouraging intermediaries from earning float income on client funds is something SEBI has been wanting to achieve.

In February last year, the market regulator floated a consultation paper, proposing daily upstreaming of idle client funds in the form of cash to Clearing Corporation. But later, the market regulator allowed the upstreaming of funds in the form of FD lien (or cash/MF units), in line with existing norms.

“Unlike full-service brokers, who have diverse revenue streams, discount brokers may face challenges, particularly in the collection of Annual Maintenance Charges (AMC) and other statutory charges,” Trivesh said.

However, Broking’s Nithin had said even though with an ASBA-like fund settlement mechanism using UPI, fee collection would have been a potential challenge, the ability to collect the same from clearing corporations would make it easier for brokers.

Further, there are concerns about the impact on trading volumes, especially proprietary trading by market intermediaries, constituting a significant portion of the cash market and F&O volumes.

This move could potentially reduce broker-provided leverage to clients, impacting the overall dynamics of the market, Trivesh said.

While the mechanism is currently optional for traders, a full implementation of for secondary markets may impact Angel One’s earnings by 20%, HDFC Securities recently said in its report."

Recent data has shown a substantial drop in Canadian study permit applications processed for Indian students, causing concern in the education sector.

An ApplyBoard report has shown that between July and October 2023, the Canadian government processed nearly 146,000 new study permit applications for Indian nationals. However, during the same period in 2023, the figures dwindled to fewer than 87,000, marking a significant year-over-year decrease of 41%.

This decline translates to a notable reduction of 60,000 student visas processed for Indian students from July to October 2023 compared to the corresponding period last year. The chart below illustrates the monthly processing totals over the past two years, highlighting a particularly significant shortfall from August to October, down by 47% compared to 2022.

The unexpected drop contrasts with the strong interest shown by Indian students in the first six months of the year, where the Canadian government processed 25% more study permit applications than in the same period in 2022.

Growing Negative Sentiment in Indian Media
While diplomatic tensions between India and Canada may seem like an obvious cause for the decline, a Better Dwelling report suggests a different theory. Social media has become a platform for international students to share their hardships in Canada, emphasizing the high cost of living and unfulfilled promises of opportunities.

A sentiment analysis of top-tier Indian media conducted by ApplyBoard supports this theory. Between April and August 2023, articles discussing housing in Canada increased fivefold compared to the same period last year. Furthermore, the percentage of content flagged as negative rose from 12% to 30%, consistently highlighting Indian students' financial hardships and unemployment challenges.

Cost of Living
In response to the escalating cost of living and inflationary pressures, the Canadian government implemented an Affordability Plan, representing a substantial $12.1 billion CAD investment. Measures include a 50% reduction in childcare fees in Ontario, a 10% increase in the Old Age Security pension for seniors, and indexing various benefits to inflation. Starting January 1st, 2024, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will raise the cost-of-living requirement for study permit applicants to prepare students for the higher cost of living in Canada.

Impact on Actual Student Inflows
Despite the decline in applications processed, study permit approval rates for Indian students have continued to rise. From January to September this year, an additional 32,000 Indian students were approved to study in Canada compared to the previous year. If processing volumes remain near half of 2022 totals, ApplyBoard projects 200,000 to 210,000 Indian students will be approved to study in Canada this year, representing a 5 to 8% increase over 2022.

Impact of the India-Canada Dispute
While the diplomatic dispute between India and Canada may have raised concerns, data suggests that it is unlikely to further depress the volume of study permit applications processed from India. According to IRCC reporting, 80% of study permit applications from Indian students processed between August and November were processed within three weeks, indicating prioritized study permit processing. The impact of the dispute on student demand remains a distinct consideration.

Diverse Student Applicants
A positive aspect amidst the challenges is the sustained interest in Canadian education from students of other nationalities. From July to October 2023, study permits processed for all other countries rose by 34%, and as of December 2023, there is a remarkable 52% rise from the previous year's total.

This shift has resulted in a more diverse set of applicants to Canadian institutions, with Indian students constituting 36% of study permit applications in 2023, compared to nearly half in the previous year. The evolving landscape emphasizes institutions' commitment to improving the diversity of their international student inflows.

The Nicaragua-bound aircraft, an Airbus A340 carrying 303 passengers, including 260 Indians, was grounded in France for four days over suspected human trafficking over a week ago. It landed in Mumbai in the early hours of December 26.

According to a senior state Crime Investigation Department (CID) - Crime and Railways official, those passengers included 66 from Gujarat, who have already reached their respective native places in the state. Superintendent of Police, CID- Crime and Railways, Sanjay Kharat, who is investigating the case, said these 66 Gujarat natives, including some minors, were mainly from Mehsana, Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar and Anand districts.

""We have already questioned 55 of them and recorded their statements. Majority of them have studied till Class 8 to 12. Each of them admitted that they had agreed to pay Rs 60 lakh to Rs 80 lakh to the local immigration agents to help them cross into the US illegally after reaching Nicaragua via Dubai,"" he said.

The state CID has so far acquired the names and contact numbers of nearly 15 agents, who had promised to help these 55 persons enter the US illegally through the US-Mexico border.

""These agents had asked these 55 persons to pay the money only after reaching the US. The agents had told the passengers that their men would take them to the US border from Nicaragua and then help them cross the border. It was also revealed that the agents had also booked air tickets for these passengers and gave USD 1,000 to 3,000 to each passenger to deal with any emergency situation,"" Kharat said.

As per the plan devised by the agents, these 66 passengers reached Dubai from Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Delhi between December 10 and 20.

As directed by the agents, these passengers boarded the Nicaragua-bound aircraft of a private airline at the Fujairah International Airport on December 21, a release issued by the CID said on Tuesday.

It added that the CID has written a letter to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to help it collect more information about the agents who had acquired Dubai visa of these 55 passengers, bank details of agents who had paid the visa fee from his account, how the agents managed to acquire visa of Nicaragua from Dubai and who booked the flight from Dubai and paid money for the tickets of passengers.

The chartered flight, which was operated by Romanian charter company Legend Airlines and bound for Nicaragua, landed at Vatry near Paris on December 21 for a technical stopover en route from Dubai when the French police intervened.

French authorities launched a judicial investigation into the conditions and purpose of the trip, with a unit specialising in organised crime investigating suspected human trafficking. Nicaragua has become a popular destination for those seeking asylum in the US.

As many as 96,917 Indians attempted to enter the US illegally in the financial year 2023, signalling a 51.61 per cent jump from the previous year, according to data made available by the US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP). At least 41,770 of those Indians attempted to enter the US via the Mexican land border, CBP data shows.

Flights to Nicaragua or third countries where obtaining travel documents is easy have come to be known as 'dunki' flights."

A bench comprising Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra took note of the plea filed by KSR Menon, a former journalist, seeking framing of a policy or guidelines to provide aftercare facilities to such people.

The PIL, filed through law firm 'KMNP LAW AOR', referred to a provision of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act which deals with the ""child in need of care and protection"".

Lawyer Abir Phukan, appearing for Menon, a former news agency journalist, said the plea has been filed for rehabilitation of children who are ""mentally ill or mentally or physically challenged or suffering from terminal or incurable disease, having no one to support or look after or having parents or guardians unfit to take care"".

The top court issued notices to the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Chief Commissioner, Persons with Disability Department of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, and sought their responses within four weeks.

""The Petitioner has preferred the present writ petition, inter alia, in public interest seeking issuance of a writ of Mandamus ... direction or guidelines for the rehabilitation and social reintegration of children of Child Care Institutions (CCIs)/Juvenile Homes who are mentally ill or mentally or physically challenged or suffer from terminal or incurable disease considered as child in need of care and protection under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 and has no one to support them or take care of them upon them turning 18 years,"" the plea said.

""Declare that 'Child in need of care and protection' (CNCP) recognised under Section 2(14)(iv) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 have a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution to aftercare beyond the age of 21 years and till the time they are rehabilitated and integrated in society,"" it said.

The plea, which referred to various studies, said according to the 2011 census, the differently-abled population in India stood at 26.8 million.

""In percentage terms, this stands at 2.21 %. There has been a marginal increase in the differently-abled population in India, with the figure rising from 21.9 million in 2001 to 26.8 million in 10 years.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/uk/uk-braces-for-heavy-rainfall-and-strong-winds-today-met-office-issues-warnings/articleshow/106487444.cms,"Large parts of the UK are set to experience substantial rainfall and gusty winds, with the Met Office issuing dual warnings for these weather conditions. Anticipating over half the average monthly rainfall within hours, the warnings are in effect until 9 pm tonight, raising concerns over potential travel disruptions and heightened challenges due to already saturated ground.

The Met Office has sounded alarms across various regions in the UK, cautioning about heavy downpours that could exceed typical January precipitation levels. With forecasts suggesting up to 50mm of rain, areas like Wales, the Midlands, eastern England, and Yorkshire might encounter the brunt of these weather patterns. Birmingham and Manchester, habitually witnessing 70mm and 77mm of rain respectively in January, are also on alert due to the impending deluge.

Meteorologist Jonathan Vautrey from the Met Office highlighted the expected widespread nature of the rain, encompassing England and Wales, while parts of southeastern and eastern Scotland might experience intermittent brighter intervals. However, the Northern Isles, Orkney, and Shetland are likely to face persistent wet and windy conditions.

In addition to the downpour, gusty winds are expected to reach speeds of 60mph in coastal areas and between 40 to 50mph elsewhere, spanning from west Wales to Kent. These winds, combined with the already saturated ground, could amplify travel disruptions, necessitating caution and preparedness among residents and travelers.

Moreover, temperatures will vary significantly from north to south, ranging between 8C to 13C, yet feeling notably colder due to the accompanying wind and rain. The weather warnings specifically indicate the likelihood of 15 to 30mm of rain across most areas, with some places expecting 35 to 50mm. Although the heaviest rain is projected to clear southwestern England and South Wales by mid-Tuesday, the north-eastern areas might experience prolonged rainfall into the evening.

The Met Office's yellow weather warning for wind, effective from 8 am to 9 pm, predicts swift development of very windy conditions, initially over southwestern England and southern Wales, eventually extending eastward across southern and central England. Coastal regions could witness gusts nearing 60mph, with inland areas likely experiencing gusts between 40 to 50mph, while the possibility of higher gusts remains uncertain.

As the nation braces for this weather onslaught, authorities advise residents and travelers to remain vigilant, heed official guidance, and stay updated with the latest weather alerts to navigate these challenging conditions safely.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/technical-breakout-stocks-how-to-trade-lemon-tree-hotels-gsfc-and-sparc-on-wednesday/articleshow/106487369.cms,"Indian market pared gains and closed lower on Tuesday tracking muted cues. The S&P BSE Sensex fell more than 300 points while the Nifty50 closed below 21,700 levels.

Sectorally, buying was seen in healthcare, energy, metal, consumer durable, and oil & gas stocks while selling was visible in capital goods, auto, banks, and IT stocks.

Stocks that were in focus include names like Lemon Tree Hotels which was up more than 9% to hit a fresh record high, GSFC was up more than 4% and Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd closed with gains of over 9% to hit a fresh 52-week high on Tuesday.








Lemon Tree Hotels formed an inverted Head and shoulder breakout on the daily chart, accompanied by significant trading volume.

The prevailing price signals robust bullish momentum, with expectations of a sustained upward movement towards the Rs 160 level. Conversely, substantial support is evident near Rs 120.

Furthermore, Lemon Tree is trading above key Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), including the 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMAs, indicating robust bullish momentum and suggesting the potential for further upward price movement.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is presently at 70, showing an upward trajectory and indicating increasing buying momentum.

To manage risk effectively, it is advisable to set a stop-loss (SL) at 120 to safeguard the investment in the event of an unexpected market turn. A prudent strategy would be to consider buying on dips at levels of Rs 125.

Overall, considering the technical analysis and current market conditions, Lemon Tree presents a promising buying opportunity for those aiming for a Rs 160 price target, provided that prudent risk management measures are in place.


GSFC, currently trading at 288 levels, has demonstrated a robust breakout above 247 levels, supported by substantial volumes, signaling underlying strength in the stock.

Notably, the stock maintains its position above key short-term (20 Day), medium-term (50 Day), and long-term (200 Day) Exponential Moving Average (EMA) levels, accentuating its resilience.

The momentum indicators further underscore the stock's positive trajectory. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) ascending to 81 levels indicates potential overbought conditions at present levels.

This overbought signal may lead to a temporary period of consolidation or sideways movement, allowing the RSI to cool off from the elevated levels.

Investors, especially those who entered at lower levels, could consider a prudent approach by booking partial profits at the current market price (CMP).

Simultaneously, trailing stop-loss orders near 247 levels can safeguard profits and manage risks effectively.

For fresh investments, a disciplined strategy involves waiting for potential dips, considering entry points near 260 levels.

Implementing a strict stop-loss at 247 levels offers a risk management mechanism, ensuring protection against adverse market movements.

Navigating the stock's future trajectory requires vigilance around RSI dynamics and potential sideways movements, presenting investors with opportunities to optimize their investment positions based on prevailing market conditions.


SPARC's daily chart analysis offers a favorable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance.

Notably, the stock has produced a notable higher high and higher low pattern, and the company's recent upward swing has effectively violated the neckline, establishing a new week high. This breakthrough indicates the possibility of a significant follow-through upward increase in the stock price.

Adding to the positive momentum, there has been an increase in trading volume, indicating growing market interest.

The stock formed a strong bullish candle that engulfed the preceding three-month candle signifying a potential continuation of the uptrend following and the daily strength indicator RSI (14) is moving upwards and positioned above its reference line indicating a positive bias.

Furthermore, SPARC is currently trading above its crucial 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) levels, reinforcing the bullish trend.

Investors, especially those who entered at lower levels, could consider a prudent approach by booking partial profits at the current market price (CMP).

Simultaneously, trailing stop-loss orders near 303 levels can safeguard profits and manage risks effectively.

For fresh investments, a disciplined strategy involves waiting for potential dips, considering entry points near 318 levels.

Implementing a strict stop-loss at 303 levels offers a risk management mechanism, ensuring protection against adverse market movements."

Speaking to reporters here, Kishan Reddy wondered if there is any ""tacit"" understanding between the Congress government in the state and the BRS party on the issue, through mediation of AIMIM.

""When in Opposition, the Congress leaders demanded a CBI inquiry into the issue. Today, why is the chief minister (Revanth Reddy) not writing a letter to the Centre seeking a CBI probe? Does the Congress government sincerely want an inquiry into the Kaleshwaram project or not? Do they want the culprits to be punished or not?"" Kishan Reddy asked.

""I want to know whether the chief minister has any sincerity. The biggest scam of the BRS government was the Kaleshwaram project. Are you willing to order a CBI inquiry? Would you write a letter (to Centre),"" the Telangana BJP chief asked.

During the assembly polls (last year), the Congress claimed that if voted to power, it would order an inquiry on ""corruption"" deeds including projects undertaken by the then BRS government, he said.

The previous government claimed the Kaleshwaram project as an engineering marvel and the largest lift irrigation project. They also said that concrete used in the project was equivalent to that of seven 'Burj Khalifa' in Dubai and steel was equivalent to that of 15 'Eiffel Tower' in Paris, he said.

The piers of the Medigadda barrage of the mega Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme 'sinking' shook the state in October 2023 as it snowballed into a major controversy and a key election issue. The National Dam Safety Authority (NDSA) had found that the barrage was severely compromised, rendering it useless unless fully rehabilitated.

Kishan Reddy asked what is the future of Kaleshwaram project and the Telangana people and what is the fate of Rs 1 lakh crore spent on the project.

The Medigadda barrage was a lifeline to the Kaleshwaram project, he said, adding that the NDSA also visited it and highlighted some of the key issues of the project. They sought some more details from the state government. However, replies were given to only 11 of the 20 issues, the BJP leader said.

""Why is the Congress government dilly-dallying on the corruption involved in the construction of the project? Will they accept NDSA suggestions? When they (Congress) were in opposition, Revanth Reddy wanted to know what the Central government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were doing. Now there is a necessity to spell out the state government's stand on the issue,"" he said.

Earlier, when the BJP demanded an inquiry, the then Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao did not approve the CBI probe, Kishan Reddy said.

Ten states and Union territories have so far detected the presence of the JN.1 sub-variant of the virus.

These states are Kerala (147), Goa (51), Gujarat (34), Maharashtra (26), Tamil Nadu (22), Delhi (16), Karnataka (eight), Rajasthan (five), Telangana (two) and Odisha (one), according to the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG).

The INSACOG's data showed 279 Covid cases recorded in the country in December had the presence of JN.1, while 33 such cases were detected in November.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has classified JN.1 as a separate ""variant of interest"" given its rapidly-increasing spread, but said it poses a ""low"" global public health risk.

The JN.1 sub-variant of the coronavirus was previously classified as a variant of interest (VOI) as part of the BA.2.86 sub-lineages, the parent lineage that is classified as a VOI, the world body said.

However, in recent weeks, JN.1 cases continued to be reported from multiple countries and its prevalence has rapidly increased globally.

The Centre has asked states and Union territories to maintain a constant vigil amid an uptick in the number of Covid cases and the detection of the JN.1 sub-variant in the country.

India has recorded 573 new coronavirus infections, while the active cases stood at 4,565, according to data released by the Health ministry on Tuesday.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/about-2000-petrol-pumps-run-dry-as-truckers-strike-against-new-penal-code/articleshow/106487802.cms,"About 2,000 petrol pumps, mostly in western and northern India, have run out of fuel stocks as the strike by some truckers' associations entered the second day on Tuesday. While state-owned oil firms had topped up tanks at most petrol pumps across the country in anticipation of the truckers' strike, some petrol pumps in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Punjab ran out of stock due to heavy rush, industry officials said.

Long queues were witnessed at several pumps in these states as panic set in on stocks running out.

Situation in southern India is better with no major supply disruption barring a few pumps in Hyderabad, they said.

Essential supplies of vegetables, fruits and milk too may get affected if the three-day strike is extended or a pan-India movement is launched.

Some truck, bus and tanker operators began a three-day strike on Monday against the stringent jail and fine regulations under the new criminal law Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS) for hit-and-run cases.

The All India Motor Transport Association -- the umbrella body of truck operators -- has so far not given a nationwide strike call and its representatives will be meeting home ministry officials to raise their concerns around BNS.

The industry officials said most petrol pumps have stocks to last 2-3 days and should not see any problems if the strike was to last for the stated three days. However, there will be trouble if the strike is extended or a pan-India protest is called, they added.

There are about 1 lakh trucks that ferry petrol and diesel as well as LPG from oil company depots to petrol pumps and gas distribution agencies.

The strike has impacted the movement of trucks in some western and northern states, they said, adding some LPG truck movement too has been impacted.

However, there is no complaints on LPG shortage just yet as most users have double connections (two LPG cylinders) and reserve stock even if one cylinder gets exhausted.

If the strike were to get extended, LPG supplies too may get hit, they said.

In Maharashtra, the state government requested police to ensure an uninterrupted supply of petrol and diesel while commuters in Madhya Pradesh encountered travel inconvenience.

Since Monday, protestors have blockaded roads and highways across states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.

The new law, which replaced the colonial-era Indian Penal Code, provides for a jail of up to 10 years and/or a fine of Rs 7 lakh for serious road accidents due to negligent driving and where drivers run away without informing the police.

Truckers said most truck drivers choose to run away even in minor accidents as they otherwise will have to face mob justice and risk of life. While the mobs typically go unpunished, to impose stringent punishment on drivers was unfair, they said.

Long queues at petrol pumps in Himachal Pradesh's Shimla and Dharamshala were also reported.

Heavy rush was seen outside petrol pumps in Mumbai and Thane as people came to fill up their vehicle tanks fearing shortage of fuel.

Petrol Dealers Association, Mumbai, President Chetan Modi told PTI that the fuel supply to petrol pumps was affected due to the drivers' agitation since Monday. ""Petrol pumps started running dry yesterday. If we don't get the supply, most of the pumps will run out of fuel by the end of the day,"" he said.

Protesters obstructed highways in several districts of Gujarat, including Kheda, Valsad, Gir Somnath, Bharuch, and Mehsana, and in places like Nagpur in Maharashtra by using trucks as blockades on roads.

Tapan Sharma, a former president of the Ahmedabad Motor Transport Association in Gujarat, told PTI that the protests occurred spontaneously. ""The association has not called for a strike. Drivers are acting independently due to concerns about the new law. They protest briefly and then move on. However, these sporadic demonstrations have caused delays in the delivery of goods.""

Three civilians, aged between 27 and 42, were found dead on December 22 after they were allegedly picked up by the Army for questioning in connection with a terrorist ambush a day before that left four soldiers dead in Poonch district.

The deaths sparked public outrage, prompting the authorities to announce compensation for their families.

""The Army is conducting its own investigation. If anyone is found to be guilty, they will definitely be punished. But such an investigation is not to be disclosed publicly. Let the Army do its work. There is no need to prejudge anything or make any comment on the Army,"" the official said.

The official said the Army itself said that it would conduct the investigation and hence everyone should have faith in it.

On December 27, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said he had full faith in the Indian Army that it will wipe out terrorism from Jammu and Kashmir, even as he urged the troops to not make such ""mistakes"" that may hurt the citizens of the country.

It is the responsibility of the troops to win the hearts of the people while performing their duty towards the security of the nation, Singh had said.

Soon after the three civilians were found dead and a few others were injured, video clips purportedly showing their torture went viral on social media.

The Army has initiated a Court of Inquiry and police lodged a murder case against unidentified persons.

""...after terror incident at DKG (Dhera Ki Gali) on December 21, Army troops carried out searches in Topa Peer in Buffliaz for the terrorists who escaped after the attack. During searches, Army troops detained a few local youths for questioning, reportedly three such youths namely Safeer Ahmad, Mohd Showkat and Shabir Ahmad succumbed to injuries.

""As such, cognizable offence under section 302 IPC is made out. On this information instant case stands registered. As the instant case is of special nature...special report will be submitted separately as investigation is taken up,"" an official said quoting the FIR.

A brigadier-level officer was shifted and action was being taken against three officers of 48 Rashtriya Rifles as the Army took serious note of the allegation of custodial torture.

The counter-insurgency unit of the Army was in the news for wrong reasons in October last year as well when one of its major-rank officers opened fire on his colleagues and exploded grenades inside the Neeli post camp near Thanamandi, leaving five personnel including three officers injured.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/startups-in-2024-innovation-cant-override-a-profitable-bottom-line/articleshow/106487468.cms,"Funding winter of 2022-2023 is a stark reminder that growth at all costs, without the backbone of profitability, is a path to ruin.
The industry also witnessed unethical practices like circular trading, further complicating the landscape.
By mid-2024, the market should stabilize, presenting opportunities for investors with cleansed portfolios and profitable ventures.
In 1999, amidst the dot-com frenzy, Warren Buffett's prophetic words at the Allen-Sunny Valley Conference foresaw the bubble's burst. I witnessed this, my first tech bubble-bust, firsthand as a 16-year-old trader in my dad’s office. At that time, companies, merely by donning a “tech” or “soft” label, saw their valuations soar. This pattern, a rollercoaster of tech stock highs and lows, has been a recurring theme in the two-plus decades since and is especially pronounced in India.

The 2021-22 period, a time marked by soaring valuations and new paradigms for appraising tech companies, was no exception. Deep down, we knew this hyper-growth was unsustainable. The subsequent 'funding winter' of 2022- 2023 is a stark reminder that growth at all costs, without the backbone of profitability, is a path to ruin. The recent downturn reiterates a lesson we've seen repeatedly over the years: the frenzy around valuation and growth must be tempered by a return to fundamental business principles. As I've observed in my 24 years of investing, this boom and bust cycle is an old story, teaching us the same lesson each time.

In the late 90s, eyeballs and clicks were the valuation cornerstone, mirroring the recent era where 'scale' overshadowed real profitability. The trend of scaling at all costs, ignoring the fundamentals of Lifetime Value (LTV) to Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) ratios, led to inflated valuations. I saw companies claiming large revenues, but after stripping away GST, discounts, and direct costs, what remained was merely 'foam'—insubstantial.

Investors, caught in a frenzy, were willing to pay exorbitant multiples on inflated revenues. A company claiming ₹24 crore in annual revenue, in reality, had just ₹9 crore, yet it fetched valuations of ₹240 crore. This discrepancy was exaggerated by a period of low-cost money due to global quantitative easing. However, as interest rates rose, these overvalued, cash-burning ventures crumbled, unable to sustain their business models without cheap capital.

As the cost of capital has skyrocketed, the focus has rightfully shifted back to profitability, a lesson reiterated in each market cycle. The bottom line after taxes, not inflated revenue figures, truly determines a business's value. While burning cash may be viable temporarily, a clear path to profitability is essential, regardless of the industry.

Let's not absolve investors, either. Many lowered their standards in their race to be seen as dynamic and founder-friendly. They prioritized deal-winning over diligence, forgoing governance and oversight. This approach turned them into mere brokers, seeking higher valuations for their investments rather than actual returns. This corrupted ecosystem was primed for a crash, and deservedly so.

During the investment frenzy, there were ventures with strong, viable business models that didn’t initially catch investors' eyes. These businesses, grounded in consumer loyalty and solid financials, were overshadowed by cashburning counterparts. Many founders, under the sway of investor expectations, pivoted from profit-generating models to cash-intensive operations.

However, ventures like Physicswallah, Zerodha, and Everest Fleet, which stayed true to their profitable roots, eventually took center stage.

This shift wasn't easy, especially for businesses ingrained in a culture of heavy spending. Reducing marketing and operational costs, essential in leaner times, led to revenue dips for many. The industry also witnessed unethical practices like circular trading, further complicating the landscape. Looking towards 2024, I foresee a challenging first half for businesses reliant on high valuations. We'll likely witness mergers, substantial down rounds, or pivots to more sustainable models.

By mid-2024, the market should stabilize, presenting opportunities for investors with cleansed portfolios and profitable ventures. Sectors like space tech, fintech infrastructure, RegTech, and enterprise SaaS are poised for growth, driven by strong problem-solving capabilities and profitability potential.

This shift back to business fundamentals underscores a crucial lesson: innovation can't override the need for a profitable bottom line. No matter how groundbreaking the technology, its existence is questionable if it doesn't lead to a sustainable business model. As we embrace this evolution, 2024 might end on a high, heralding a new era of rational, value-driven investments.

In conclusion, 2024 will be an exciting year for investing.

As a favourite saying from one of my beloved Batman movies goes, ""The night is darkest just before the dawn."" In these funding winters, long-term winning investments can be found, separating the hay from the chaff. In these markets, winning investments are discovered, and unique businesses are at fantastic valuations.

Think about the wealth creation Amazon and Infosys have had since their lows of 2000 or Microsoft and HDFC since their lows of 2010. Investors who have been prudent, sitting on cash, waiting for the market to return to normalcy, will find exceptional opportunities at fantastic prices. I expect 2024 to end on a very high note.

Investors will get opportunities to buy out positions or to get into companies that are doing great work but have chosen the wrong path to gaining investor eyeballs, which would require capital to mend the errors. All of these will find opportunities in 2024. So, I expect 2024 to be a fantastic year for investing. I'm supremely excited. Here’s to a fantastic 2024, and seeing you in the cap tables of 2024’s success stories.

Brokerage picks HCL Technologies as his top bet among the tier-I IT companies while Cyient is in the tier-II pack.

Unfavorable macros and furloughs have extended the timelines for deal closures and executions across companies, leading to slower revenue conversion in Q3, the Motilal report said.

Following this report, IT stocks fell up to 3% on Tuesday with Nifty IT Index turning out to be among the worst sectoral performers for the day. The 10-stock index fell up to 1.6% or 590 points with 9 declines around 2:50 pm. The biggest laggards were MphasiS, Coforge and LTIMindtree.

The seasonality is likely to hurt revenue growth and margin performances of both tier-1 and tier-2 IT companies even as the industry grapples with spending issues across enterprises, the report said. Although sentiment has improved, it has not yet been reflected in actions, the report added.

Motilal expects its IT services coverage universe to report a median revenue growth of 0.7% quarter-on-quarter and 2.5% year-on-year in 3QFY24.

Meanwhile, Tier-I IT companies under Motilal's coverage universe are also expected to report flat QoQ net profit with a corresponding decline of 2.6% YoY. Meanwhile, tier-II players should register a PAT growth of 5.2% QoQ and 9.3% YoY.


1) The adverse movement of major currencies is anticipated to further slow down the reported growth, the report mentioned. Euro and GBP have declined 1.2% and 2% during the quarter. However, the weakening of INR by 70 bps against USD should act as a support, the report said. ""We estimate a flat USD revenue YoY, while INR EBIT/INR PAT YoY will decline 4.0%/2.0% in 3QFY24,"" the note said.

2) Deal TCVs of Tier1 + Tier to moderate from the 2Q high base.

Over the last quarter, the returns by Nifty IT index have been to the tune of 11% which is slightly higher than the returns delivered by Nifty at 10.21%."

""With an aim to promote CBDC wallet transactions, banks have been advised to encourage all staff members to transact using the digital currency and ensure 100% staff registration on digital rupee app,"" the bank said in a communication to employees on December 26.

To start with, the bank management has decided to credit newspaper allowance directly to the CBDC wallet. The bank advised all its employees to register on the bank's digital rupee app.

The images on broadcaster NHK showed the plane moving along the runway before an explosion of orange flames burst from beneath and behind it.

All 367 passengers on board the Airbus plane were evacuated, broadcaster NHK reported. The cause of the incident was not immediately clear, but television reports said that the Airbus collided with a coast guard aircraft.

Reports said that the plane had just arrived from Sapporo airport on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. A coast guard official at Haneda Airport, one of the world's busiest, said they were ""checking details"".

""It's not clear if there was a collision. But it is certain that our plane is involved,"" he told AFP.

The television footage showed flames coming out of windows and the plane's nose on the ground as rescue workers sprayed it. There was also burning debris on the runway.

More than 70 fire engines were being deployed, NHK reported. Japan has not suffered a serious commercial aviation accident in decades.

Its worst ever was in 1985, when a JAL jumbo jet flying from Tokyo to Osaka crashed in central Gunma region, killing 520 passengers and crew.

That disaster was one of the world's deadliest plane crashes involving a single flight.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nifty-bank-falls-nearly-1-forms-bearish-marubozu-candle-on-daily-charts/articleshow/106486512.cms,"The Nifty Bank fell by about 1% on Tuesday, in line with the selling pressure seen in benchmark indices. The Nifty50 closed below 21,700 levels.

The Nifty Bank fell nearly 500 points to close at 47,761, led by losses in Kotak Bank, ICICI Bank, and IndusInd Bank.

Federal Bank, AU Small Finance Bank, and Kotal Bank closed with losses of over 2% each, while some buying was seen in HDFC Bank.

The Nifty Bank witnessed sustained selling pressure throughout the trading session, which resulted in the formation of a bearish Marubozu candle on the daily charts.

The bearish Marubozu is a bearish candle with a long red body and no shadows, indicating strong selling pressure and a potential downtrend.

The index opened at 48,194 and rose marginally to 48223 but failed to hold on to the momentum, resulting in the formation of a small upper shadow. It witnessed a sell-off, which took the index towards 47,689.

“Nifty Bank index formed a Bearish Marubozu candle on a daily scale and started to form lower highs - lower lows from the past three sessions,” Chandan Taparia, Senior Vice President and Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited, said.
“Index has relatively underperformed the broader market as selective banking stocks remained under selling pressure and ended with losses of around 470 points,” he said.


The Nifty Bank index opened marginally lower and gradually drifted lower towards 47,700 zones in the latter part of the day. It closed at 47,761 on Tuesday.

For bulls to take control, a close above 48,300 is required, suggest experts. However, a close below 47,600 could fuel bearish sentiment.

""The Bank Nifty witnessed sustained bearish pressure throughout the trading day, leading to a close below the crucial support level of 48,000,” said Kunal Shah, Senior Technical and derivative Analyst at LKP Securities.

“To resume an upward trend and regain positive momentum, the index needs to achieve a breakout above the resistance at 48,300, targeting levels of 49,000/50,000,” he said.

“The immediate support for the index is positioned at 47,600, coinciding with its 20-day moving average (20DMA). A decisive breach below this level could intensify the downward momentum,” recommended Shah."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/everyone-wants-to-do-an-fta-with-india-gtri-report/articleshow/106486792.cms,"Countries ranging from large economies like Europe, and the UK to smaller ones, including Oman and Peru, want to have a free trade agreement with India due to the country's large and rapidly growing market, a report by economic think tank GTRI said. The Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said that by implementing a trade deal (FTA) with India, countries can access the Indian market with less or no import duties on substantial trade.

This gives their companies an advantage over others in selling to the Indian market.

Additionally, since India currently does most of its importing (over 75 per cent) from countries it does not have FTAs with, these agreements are particularly appealing as they offer a significant new market opportunity in India.

""Everyone wants to do an FTA with India. Countries ranging from large economies like the US, Europe, Japan, and the UK to smaller ones like Oman, Peru, and Mauritius either already have or actively seeking an FTA with India. The main reason is India's high import duties, which make it difficult for these countries to access India's large and rapidly growing market,"" it said.

However, it said that India may not see a big increase in exports from FTAs under negotiations.

The countries with which India is negotiating trade agreements already have low import duties.

""For example, the UK's duties are 4.1 per cent, Canada's 3.3 per cent, and the USA's 2.3 per cent. In contrast, India's import duties are higher at 12.6 per cent,"" GTRI Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava said.

Also, a substantial share of imports from these nations are already happening at zero MFN (most favoured nation) duties, he said.

Canada's 70.8 per cent of imports are already happening at zero MFN duty. The same is the case with Switzerland (61 per cent), the US (58.7 per cent), the UK (52 per cent), EU (51.8 per cent).

""In contrast, in India only 6.1 per cent of global imports are undertaken at zero MFN duty. Given this, India might not see a big increase in exports after these FTAs because these countries already have low or no import duties,"" Srivastava added.

On the other hand, countries like the UK and Canada could benefit more from the FTAs, as they will be able to sell their products in India without the high duties that India usually imposes.

The report suggested the government six steps while negotiating these deals and that includes creation of common exclusion list for merchandise trade negotiations; and focusing on obtaining real market access on the ground.

The other suggestions include doing sectoral agreements with poor and developing countries instead of trade deals involving goods, services, and investments; and negotiate new subject areas such as environment, labor, data governance, digital trade, gender, small and medium enterprises, anti-corruption, and sustainable food systems, carefully.

The minister inaugurated the newly-constructed BHEL Sadan in Noida on the occasion of BHEL Day on Monday, the company said in a statement.

Addressing on the occasion he cited the clarion call of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for achieving the target of 'net zero' carbon emissions by 2070 and said that this 18-storey, eco-friendly green building constructed as per the latest technology and standards is a symbol of BHEL's commitment towards environmental protection.

The minister noted that the building, equipped with a 30-kW solar power system, reflects BHEL's commitment to move further towards green energy.

Recalling BHEL's contribution towards creating an Aatmanirbhar Bharat, since its inception, Pandey added that BHEL is not only striving towards making India self-reliant in the fields of energy and infrastructure but it is also making significant contributions towards the field of defence and space.

Speaking on the occasion, heavy industries secretary Kamran Rizvi shared that for an organisation to have its own properties, gives confidence and motivation to its employees.

He further noted that this new building, a symbol of BHEL's glorious history and stature, would serve as an inspiration to us all in the days to come.

K Sadashiv Murthy, CMD, BHEL said that as most of the employees working in the Delhi-NCR region live in the company's township at Noida, they will experience a better work-life balance with the shifting of all the company offices to the new building.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/govt-lets-women-employees-nominate-children-instead-of-husband-for-pension-in-marital-discord-cases/articleshow/106485423.cms,"A woman employee can now nominate her child or children for family pension in precedence over her husband in case of marital discord, the Centre said on Tuesday.

Rule 50 of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 2021 allows the grant of family pension following the death of a government servant or retired government servant.

If a deceased government servant or pensioner is survived by a spouse, family pension is first granted to the spouse. Other family members become eligible for family pension, on their turn, only after the spouse of the deceased government servant/pensioner becomes ineligible for family pension or dies, according to the rules.

The Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has now amended the rules and allowed a woman employee to nominate her child/children over her husband for the family pension.

""The amendment allows disbursement of family pension of a female government servant to an eligible child in precedence to her husband, in all cases where she has filed a divorce petition or a petition under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act or cases under Indian Penal Code,"" DoPPW Secretary V Srinivas told PTI.

He said the amendment was formulated by DoPPW in consultation with the Ministry of Women and Child Development taking into consideration representations received.

""The amendment is progressive in nature and empowers women employees in family pension cases,"" said Srinivas, a 1989-batch Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer of Rajasthan cadre.

In an order, the DoPPW said that in case divorce proceedings in respect of a female government servant/female pensioner are pending in a court of law, or she has filed a case against her husband under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act or Dowry Prohibition Act or under Indian Penal Code, ""such female government servant/female pensioner may make a request for grant of family pension after her death to her eligible child/children, in precedence to her husband"".

The DoPPW said it received a large number of references from ministries and departments, seeking advice as to whether a female government servant/female pensioner can be allowed to nominate her eligible child/children for family pension in place of her spouse in the event of marital discord leading to filing of divorce proceedings in a court of law.

Giving details, the order said a woman employee may make a request in writing to the concerned head of office that in the event of her death ""during the pendency of any of the aforesaid proceedings, family pension may be granted to her eligible child/children in precedence to her spouse"", the statement said.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/goldman-sachs-cuts-indias-cad-forecast-sees-improving-external-balances/articleshow/106484984.cms,"Goldman Sachs has lowered its projection for India’s current account deficit in 2024 to 1.3% of GDP from 1.9% earlier as the US bank expects services exports to continue surprising on the upside while crude oil prices are expected to decline, improving external balances.

“India’s external balances remain favorable with a combination of low current account deficit, strong public market capital flows, adequate FX reserves and low external debt. Combined with this, our expectations for a weaker dollar suggest a “goldilocks” environment for external balances,” Goldman Sachs economists Santanu Sengupta, Arjun Varma and Andrew Tilton wrote in a January 2 note.

The foreign bank projects crude oil prices at $81 per barrel in 2024 from above $90 per barrel earlier. Lower crude oil prices help India’s external metrics as well as contain inflation as the country is one of the largest importers of the commodity. In its October 2023 Monetary Policy Report, the Reserve Bank of India said that its assumption for crude oil prices was $85 per barrel.

India’s current account deficit printed at 2% of GDP in the previous financial year. In Jul-Sep 2023, the CAD was at 1% of GDP.

Goldman Sachs’ economists sounded optimistic on capital flows in 2024, predicting strong equity flows once the US Federal Reserve starts to cut interest rates. On the debt front, the economists estimated firm inflows as India starts being included in the JP Morgan bond index from June 2024.

FDI flows to India also stand to benefit from regional supply chain diversification, they said. Goldman Sachs’ US economics team forecasts 5 rate cuts by the Fed in 2024.

“Both debt and equity inflows have followed similar trends in 2023 — peaking in Q2 CY23 and moderating in Q3. However, both equity and debt inflows have picked up in Q4. Based on the current run rates we revise our FPI forecast higher to $28 billion v. $24 billion earlier.”

The economists pointed out that even though net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows had turned positive in October they were still tracking materially lower in 2023 versus 2022 because of a higher cost of capital globally. Net FDI inflows turned positive at $6 billion in October after outflows worth about $300 million in Jul-Sep of 2023. Up to October 2023, FDI inflows were at $17 billion versus $36 billion the same time a year ago.

“Based on the current run rates we estimate net FDI inflows to end the year at around $19 billion,” the economists wrote.

While the rupee will continue to exhibit low volatility versus the US dollar, the economists expect the domestic currency to underperform most emerging market Asian currencies as the RBI is likely to build its foreign exchange reserves by purchasing dollars.

“We continue to expect the USD/INR to hover around 83.0-82.0 in the next 3-6 months, and then appreciate slightly to 81.0 over the next 12 months.” The rupee, which depreciated less than 1% against the US dollar in 2023, was last trading at 83.32/$1."

RJD national spokesman and Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Kumar Jha made the allegation at a press conference here, vowing to continue the fight against the BJP which he accused of having converted the country into a ""police state"".

The BJP, however, denied the allegation, asserting that the agencies worked independently and only those who had indulged in corruption were scared of these.

Jha said, ""There are some conscientious people in these agencies at various levels. Those who are not happy with the diktat of becoming a political instrument in the hands of the BJP have confided in me. They are under instructions to go after opposition leaders till January 22, when the media focus will shift towards Ayodhya"".

During this period, these agencies have been ""asked to be particularly active in states like Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Delhi, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra"", he claimed.

""Prominent leaders who will be in the crosshairs include Tejashwi Yadav, Abhishek Banerjee, Arvind Kejriwal, Bhagwant Mann, Hemant Soren and members of the MK Stalin ministry,"" Jha said.

Notably, Jha's allegation comes in the backdrop of summons issued to RJD leader and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav by the Enforcement Directorate.

The ED has asked Yadav to appear before it in Delhi on January 5, in the land-for-jobs scam pertaining to the period when his father and party president Lalu Prasad was the Railway minister.

The RJD MP said, ""We are not scared of such antics. It is the BJP, which is always wary of taking on its opponents politically. It had received a crushing defeat in the Bihar assembly polls of 2015 and is staring at a similar humiliation in Lok Sabha polls"".

Jha lambasted the BJP for ""trying to politically cash in"" on the construction of the temple at Ayodhya, saying ""they are followers not of Ram but Nathuram (Gandhi's assassin). We, on the other hand, are followers of the Mahatma who was a true devotee and had the name of the Lord on his lips when he was hit by the bullets which claimed his life"".

""During the period till January 22, you will see all three agencies working in tandem, sharing files which will be handed to these by their political bosses. After the inauguration of the temple, there will be a brief lull. And after the last week of April, you will never hear of the so-called cases ever"", claimed the RJD leader.

Reacting to the charge, state BJP spokesman Arvind Kumar Singh said ""ED, CBI and I-T are independent agencies and the BJP never interferes in their functioning. But those with corruption taints are naturally scared of these. The RJD must be particularly wary since its supremo Lalu Prasad has already been convicted in several fodder scam cases"".

Sensex fell over 650 points to give up its control over Mt 72K while Nifty failed to sustain 21,700 level.

Sensex ended the day 379 points weaker at 71,892 while Nifty ended at 21,665.80. Small and midcaps were relatively less affected. Nifty Bank ended 1% weaker while Nifty Auto fell 1.37% on weaker than expected December sales numbers. Nifty IT and Realty also fell over 1% each.

Nifty, which hit a fresh record high of 21,834.35 in Monday's session, saw a sell-off in the last 30 minutes of yesterday's trading session, signifying the market can be vulnerable at peaks due to profit booking.

Kotak Institutional Equities sees a modest upside of just 1% for Nifty by December 2024. ""As per our ‘Nifty fair value’ model, the index is now close to 20% overvalued. Thus, we do not anticipate a large upside to the index from this point. The most likely outcome for the index in the next 6-9 month period seems to be a time correction,"" the brokerage said.


Whenever there is a decrease in the FII long short ratio supported by PCR bearish divergence, Nifty tends to correct. ""The first time this happened was on July 19 and 20 when Nifty made a top of 19,992 and corrected 3.85%. The second time it happened was on September 14 and Nifty made a top of 20,222 on September 15 and corrected 6.84%. Nifty has given the same signal again on January 1,"" SAMCO Securities said.


December month sales data shows that auto OEMs’ volumes grew on a YoY basis across segments, barring CVs and tractors, with the 2W segment leading the growth, while PV volume displayed moderate growth.

Midcap funds are probably the third most popular category with Rs 21500 crore. So such a large proportion of new flows that are going into mid and smallcaps is a little bit of worry and probably a mistake. Because what investors are probably looking to do is thinking and extrapolating that what has happened in the past with mid and smallcaps will continue to do so.”

Since we have reached the end of this year, it is very important to do a quick recap and also highlight the investment mistakes. When we talk about investment mistakes, it could be the investment calls. Could be anything and everything related to their personal finance. Before we get into the kind of mistakes investors might have done, a quick recap when it comes to the investment portfolio for 2023?
Kaustubh Belapurkar: Firstly, thank you so much for having me on the show and hello to all the viewers. I think it has been a very exciting year. We said that we have obviously gone through many ups and downs. A lot of global events that have played out but India has really been that shining light from a global market perspective. And it has been a great year to be an investor in India. So just setting the context, 2023 has been a great year.

Hopefully things will continue. I know there will always be short-term blips in any investor's investing journey. But the whole idea is that we continue to think about investing as a portfolio construction approach instead of a product approach. And that is really what we would look to assess in terms of some of the mistakes that investors have potentially made in the year. And how do we address them from a holistic portfolio construction approach.

All right. So let us talk about the first mistake. We have seen this has been a year for midcap and small caps and largecaps. Although we see the largecap story now coming back, one important question that all investors have in their mind is the kind of returns that they have been seeing in midcap and small cap. Talking about specific funds, smallcaps have given returns beyond 35%. In fact, both the categories are midcap and smallcap funds. Will this performance continue or is there any steam left in midcap and smallcap as far as 2024 is concerned?
Kaustubh Belapurkar: I think you have hit the nail on the head. Obviously, small and midcaps have been a darling for investors if you look at 2023 data. And obviously, because the stocks, the funds have done exceedingly well in the year 2023. And if I just take it back a little bit in time, we can see that 2020, 2021 were also exceedingly good years for these counters. In 2022, probably the tide will reverse a little. There was some minor correction on these counters, especially on small caps. And 2023 again, it has kind of really caught a lot of steam.

That said, when I just look at the data in terms of flows that have come into mid and smallcap funds, that is a little bit of a mistake what investors are making. When I just break the overall flows down, I see that smallcap funds have actually been the largest recipients of flows of almost Rs 37,000 crorein 2023.

Which are the midcap and smallcap funds that look good for 2024? Nirav Karkera answers
Midcap funds are probably the third most popular category with Rs 21500 crore. So such a large proportion of new flows that are going into mid and smallcaps is a little bit of worry and probably a mistake. Because what investors are probably looking to do is thinking and extrapolating that what has happened in the past with mid and smallcaps will continue to do so. Even the folio count data shows that, right.

While large and flexicap should be the largest allocation in any investor's portfolio, we have hardly seen any new folio counts being developed. So all the new investors who are coming whereas small caps saw folios going up by 50%, midcaps increased by 20% that means a lot of new investors are coming to mid and smallcaps.

Now, why that concerns me is because, obviously, the expectations have been set with the more recent returns that these counters have delivered. And that is where I would like investors to think and take a pause. Yes, we have had this great rally in mid and smallcaps, especially when we think about relative to large caps, which actually have not done that badly.

But relatively, obviously, mid and small caps have really outperformed these counters. But will this continue? The simple answer is no, because remember that it could continue in the short-term. It will continue over the long-term where mid and small caps are great sort of wealth creators, but remember, we have seen periods in time, and I will just take it back to not more than five, six years ago. 2017 was a classic case where you had the sharp run-up in mid- and small-caps, and in fact, especially on the midcap side, where it kind of hit new highs.

Now, the challenges in 2018, where the largecaps relatively did better, mid and smallcaps saw a reasonably sharp correction that followed 2018 and some part of 2019, especially on the small-caps. So this is a part and parcel of investing, and mid and smallcaps just by the virtue of these stocks being more upcoming companies, there will be increased volatility in these counters, as we have seen in the past, and it will continue to do so.

So investing in this is great, but investors need to think of two things when they invest in mid and small caps. One is have realistic expectations, right. Do not expect that what has happened in the past, delivering 35%, 40% returns is going to continue forever. That is definitely not going to be the case. And secondly, have an adequate time horizon when you think about investing in this, especially when mid and small caps have really rallied so significantly. You have to think about at least 7 to 10 years in these counters given the valuations that some of these counters will be trading at. And always use a portfolio approach.

So do not over-allocate to mid and smallcaps purely because they have done well recently. You have to build an asset allocation which would in your equity have a significant amount of large cap exposure which is like the stable part or the most stable part of your equity portfolio and then add mid and small caps according to that. But do not go overboard in your mid and small cap exposure because that can result in exceedingly large volatility over the short term which you want to avoid.

All right, let us move on to our second mistake, wherein I think the second on your list is thematic investing. Where do you think investors have gone wrong in this particular area because mostly they have been focused in midcap and small cap. But then within that also, have they missed the bus as far as thematic investment is concerned or have gone overboard?
Kaustubh Belapurkar: Yes, absolutely. And that is actually a very interesting data point that I saw. So I alluded to mid and smallcaps being third and first on the list of categories that receive the most amount of flows. Thematic and sector funds are actually second with about 25,000 flows of overall flows that have come into the equity funds this year. Now, what is interesting is, when you think about sectors and themes, sectoral fund will obviously target a very, very specific sector within the entire market. A theme could be slightly more broad-based.

What were the hits & misses of largecap, midcap and smallcap funds in 2023? Feroze Azeez answers
But what is important to acknowledge is that both of these will go through, the market is cyclical in nature. We all know that. We spoke about the cyclicality of points when midcaps do well, when smallcaps will do well or points when largecaps will do well. A similar cyclical nature is also observed with sectors and themes. So there will be times when a particular sector is doing well and tomorrow, the next year, maybe the sector that was doing poorly today is doing better tomorrow.

The one that is doing well today actually starts underperforming. That is the nature of the market and that is going to continue. Now, my challenge for investors is one is, again a lot of investing is happening on two fronts in sector and thematic funds. One is, obviously these seem a little more exciting because they are different from your regular diversified equity funds. It seems exciting to invest into but more often than not, investing is keeping it simple.

Because what happens is when you take exposure to a sector fund, especially when you are looking at past performance, like I said, the cyclicality of the market will ensure that probably the sector fund that you are buying today because it did well yesterday is going to underperform in recent years. That is where the challenge comes to investors. The classic case that we have used in the past is when we think about technology as a sector. They did exceedingly well in the early days of Covid in 2020 and 2021 where, obviously, the stock prices shot up and the funds did well.

But investor money into technology funds came after this rally had already delivered and it actually came in large part in 2022 and early 2023. Now, obviously, the challenge is that performance has already happened. We know what has happened with the technology sector in recent times. It is obviously underperforming. Now, investors are caught at this crossroad that I bought into the sector fund thinking that, hey, this sector has done so well, it continues to do well. But actually, the exact opposite has happened.

That is where the investors need to be very, very careful that what is ideally most investors are probably best served by just buying diversified equity funds because the fund manager who is paid to do that job will take more graded overweight, underweight calls, depending on his or her conviction on a particular sector, with all the research and the fundamental calls that they are taking, they would take graded calls, right. It would not be a zero-one game which would be the case if you bought a sector fund directly, right. So that is probably the best approach for most investors to take.

Only invest in a sector fund if you think you have the wherewithal to do some research, understand the underpinnings of the sector, what could drive it, and also get your entry exit right, right. Because right now, probably like I said, technology is going through its downturn. It might persist for a little period of time. Now would be a better time to probably get in rather than a year or two ago when it was at its peak, right. So those are some of the things you need to think about, but I think broadly, ideally avoid if you cannot take a call. If you can take a call, also then take a very, very small exposure within your entire portfolio construct. Typically, we do not recommend more than 10% overall in sector funds and not more than 5% per sector. This is obviously a thumb rule, but like I said, most investors best stick to diversified equity funds.

What about investors who are scared of market volatility and new highs. A lot of investors, when they see the market going down, they stay away. And when the market is going up, making new highs and achieving new levels. It is not the right time to put money in it. But what if someone has really missed this rally? FOMO can be avoided if you are participating in markets in a disciplined way in 2024. What is the mistake over here?
Kaustubh Belapurkar: Yes, absolutely. So, there has also been the segment of investors who have kind of waited on the sidelines, thinking that okay, equity markets look over heated. There are a lot of potential triggers; global volatility, elections coming in the coming year and all of that, and markets continue to make new highs. So let me wait on the side, let me wait for a market correction, then I will deploy my money.

I always think of this as an example of, anyone from Mumbai can relate, if you are waiting for a local train at any of the stations and you see one train go by which is very crowded, you said, let me wait, I will get into the next one. And that is probably even more crowded than before. But eventually, what happens is that you keep missing your trains, and you do not get to your destination. Investing is a little bit like that.

There will be periods of market exuberance, there will be periods of when the markets are correcting. But I think as an investor, you need to stay the course. What is most important is you must decide what is your risk budget, risk allocation and how to invest in a volatile asset class like equities. We all know it is volatile but as long as you are invested in the long term, it will pay off. But you have to stay the course, you have to make the journey to make the returns right, so I think that is most important.

How do you do it, especially for new investors who are probably worried or perturbed that markets have hit new highs, how do I invest? The easiest thing to do, and I think this is where SIP has become such a beautiful thing. You are completely avoiding market risk. You are avoiding those behavioral biases. When you set up an SIP, it will automatically allocate that as per your chosen dates, and you do not really need to do anything.

In fact, I think of it as a great financial discipline tool because it ensures that you save that much money to fund your SIPs month on month. So I think that is, I mean, it is a great tool, and I would urge every investor to think about just forget about all the market noise, it will come and go in the short term. But if you have the right time horizon, just continue to invest regularly, and you will reap the benefits at the end of your period.

This also gets me to the question of rebalancing your portfolio. And is it the right time to do it? If you have not done it in 2023, do you think going ahead because more than international triggers, we have the major trigger of election. What about rebalancing your portfolio? Should you have already done it when you saw so much return in your portfolio overall across asset classes? What was a mistake that was done and how can you avoid it?
Kaustubh Belapurkar: So, two mistakes here; one is that if you are making fresh allocations, like I was alluding to earlier, a lot of money, especially from individual investors, has moved towards equities and probably ignoring the other asset classes that are in the market, be it fixed income, be it gold and other such asset classes.

Now, as an investor, equities are a must-have, especially if you have a long-term investment horizon. But like I said, asset allocation should always be the core to your investment thesis and thinking because everyone has different risk-return objectives, different time horizons because if your time horizon is not that long, then maybe your equity allocation will be very different from an investor who is investing maybe for 20, 25 years.

So, it is very important to keep in mind. And that is probably where because of this exuberance, all the exciting returns that have been there in the equity markets, people have lost that focus on asset allocation and piling in a lot of money purely into equities and ignoring the other asset classes. That is one.

For existing investors who already got good portfolios that are running and that is also a very important thing to keep in mind, is that if one particular asset class, like equities, ran up quite significantly in the last couple of years, if it has become over allocated in the portfolio, purely because of market movement, now is a good time as any to reduce that exposure back to where you thought your original level should have been.

If you were an 80-20, 80-equity-20 fixed income investor, and probably now it has gone to 90-10 purely because of the equity rally, bring it back closer to 80. So, in a way, you are booking your profits and you are bringing it back to the strategic asset allocation that you had in mind for your portfolio. Because the last thing you want is, if there is a sharp correction tomorrow in the market, your 90 could fall below 80 level and it goes both ways.

So, this is in a market rally, but tomorrow, if there is a correction and your equity allocation falls below your required level, you should actually bring it up. Portfolio rebalancing is something which gets often forgotten and missed in both times of market exuberance and market volatility, just a reminder to investors that do that. If you cannot do it yourself, contact a financial advisor who will help you do that. It is a very important lesson again from the market of 2023.

What is the next mistake on your list?
Kaustubh Belapurkar: This is more granular when we think about funds. And we just track a lot of investments and flows that are coming into different types of funds. So, we spoke about market cap. We spoke about sectors and themes. But even within the diversified equity space, like we talked about market rotation, I think the other thing that happens is what we call style rotation where we have spoken about growth managers or blend managers or value biased managers.

Now, just taking you back in time, the years of 2018-19 and the first half of 2020 were excellent years for growth managers. And you would have seen a certain segment of funds within any category do much better than their peers, probably because they ran a growth style mandate and those funds did well. But in more recent times, which is 2021 and 2022 and a large part of 2023, you have seen value come back to the fore. And what we saw from investors, and this is a mistake which often happens in these kinds of markets, is so in 2018, 2019 and 2020 when growth did well and value was underperforming, after this period of 2020 because again, looking at past performance, investors started piling into growth style funds.

Growth style funds got an exceeding amount of flows in the years of 2020 and 2021 and even last part of 2022 because the tailwind of the performance still looked good from a historical perspective for growth funds. And they actually sold out value funds in their portfolio to fund this growth fund purchase. Now, the opposite has started happening because the value style is doing well over the last couple of years, mind you, not right now, now that shift has started happening where we are seeing outflows from growth style funds.

Mind you, very good, well-managed growth style funds and buying into value funds. Now, when you are always chasing the tail or chasing the market, you could get hit both ways. So if you were an investor in 2020 who had value style funds, you sold it and you bought growth funds. So not only did you lose out on the outperformance of value funds in the subsequent years but the funds that you bought actually relatively underperformed. So you get hit both ways.

The same thing can happen, what we are seeing in the data today. I am not saying that the cycle is going to turn. No one can predict the cycle turning. Is it going to happen six months, one year, two years, we do not know. That is all a function of market forces. But we know that the cycles continue to rotate. And that is why as an investor, rather than trying to chase the tail every time, build a diversified portfolio across manager styles also, which is growth, value, and blend, so that you do not really have to do this churn every year where you are losing out both ways rather, you build an all-weather portfolio. I think that is really a lesson from what we see from the mistake that investors made in 2020.

The last mistake now that should be avoided in 2024 is having yourself and your portfolio diversified across categories, across asset classes.
Kaustubh Belapurkar: Yes, absolutely. We have spoken about all of this and often the two things that get missed out is international equity. I know there are certain challenges, obviously, with limits and flows and what funds are available. But the one thing that we also saw was that international funds actually witnessed outflows of about 2,000 crores this year, as opposed to sharp inflows that we have seen in the recent years. Obviously, like I said, some of this is because of some of the flows being capped.

But the larger challenge here, again, is because 2022 and remember, there is always a lot of this with a rear view looking bias. 2022, obviously, India did relatively much better than international markets, especially some of the tech names in 2022 had sharp corrections. And looking at that, a lot of investors would have probably looked to sell out for a relative India story. And we know that 2023 has been a very different year. A lot of the tech names have made a comeback and they are doing well. So the whole idea is that you build an international exposure, which can work as a diversifier within your overall equity basket and stay invested.

Do not keep buying and selling, looking at what is happening with the funds relative to India because the whole idea of having international stocks is sometimes Indian stocks will do well, sometimes international stock will do well. So I think you need to build that diversifier in there. The other thing, I would not say is often ignored because gold is an asset class that we all love in terms of physical gold. But, when you look at flows of the gold funds and ETFs, it has not been that significant, about close to about Rs 2,800 crore.

In terms of pure diversifying, that can be done by using gold as a hedge, especially when we enter volatile times and then major both global and local events happening. Having a gold hedge in the portfolio is probably a good idea. And like I said, a holistic portfolio construction approach is definitely something like equities, fixed income, international equities, gold, something that I would urge investors to think about when they construct their portfolio."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/jeffrey-epstein-case-donald-trump-bill-clinton-traveled-on-lolita-express-flight-logs-reveal/articleshow/106486249.cms,"In a startling revelation it became clear on Monday that former presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump took trips on Jeffrey Epstein’s famed 'Lolita Express' jet, reports the New York Post. With this revelation, it has become clear that they were among some of the high-profile passengers who rubbed shoulders with the alleged pedophile. Bill Clinton is also expected to be identified as 'John Doe 36' and mentioned more than 50 times in documents related to a 2015 lawsuit from Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre. The document will be released soon. Lawyer Alan Dershowitz, former US Sen. George Mitchell and UK's Prince Andrew were among those names declared as passengers.

Donald Trump on Jeffrey Epstein's plane

Similarly, former US president Donald Trump took at least seven trips on a private plane between 1993 and 1997. Trump was a business tycoon and real estate developer at that time and was known as an associate of Epstein. Clinton has been photographed on the jet numerous times. He also hosted Epstein as a guest at the White House on at least 17 occasions during his presidency. He has denied any nefarious connections with the offender. But the documents are not expected to implicate him in any illegal activity.

Many more accusers and alleged victims are expected to be named when the document is made public, along with people who worked for Epstein over the years.

Allegations against Prince Andrew

Virginia Giuffre, an alleged victim of deceased pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, settled a $12 million lawsuit over allegations that Epstein sex-trafficked her to Prince Andrew. Manhattan federal Judge Loretta Preska on Monday ordered the release of the long-sealed documents, that Giuffre brought against the convicted pedophile’s madam, Ghislaine Maxwell, back in 2015.

Giuffre reached a $12 million settlement with Prince Andrew in 2022 over allegations he had sex with her three times when she was a teen through Epstein’s wide-reaching trafficking web. The Duke of York will likely face renewed scrutiny if named in the documents despite his longtime proclamations of innocence in the debauched trade.

FAQs:
What was 'Lolita Express'?

'Lolita Express' was alleged pedophile Jeffrey Epstein's private jet, on which many celebrities including Former US Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump traveled.

Why is this case in the news now?

Manhattan federal Judge Loretta Preska on Monday ordered the release of the long-sealed documents, that Giuffre brought against the convicted pedophile’s madam, Ghislaine Maxwell, back in 2015. The documents will be released very soon.

Sugar season runs from October to September.

Releasing the latest data, the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories (NFCSF) said a total of 511 factories had crushed 1,223 lakh tonnes of sugarcane till December 2023 of the ongoing season.

Among the top three sugar producing states, the output in Maharashtra and Karnataka remained lower during the October-December period of this season.

""Since the central government has limited the production of ethanol from sugarcane juice, the total availability of new sugar in the country for local consumption is expected to be 305 lakh tonnes,"" NFCSF President Jaiprakash Dandegaonkar said.

According to the NFCSF data, sugar production in Maharashtra -- the country's top sugar producing state -- was lower at 38.20 lakh tonnes till December of 2023-24 season, as against 47.40 lakh tonnes in the year-ago period.

Similarly, the production in Karnataka, the country's third largest producing state, was lower at 24 lakh tonnes, as against 26.70 lakh tonnes in the said period.

However, Uttar Pradesh, the country's second largest sugar producing state, produced more sugar at 34.65 lakh tonnes till December of this season, when compared to 30.80 lakh tonnes in the year-ago period.

NFCSF said the average sugar recovery in the country stood at 9.17 per cent and ""as winter progresses, sugar yield is expected to increase accordingly"".

By the end of the season, Uttar Pradesh is expected to produce 115 lakh tonnes of sugar, Maharashtra 90 lakh tonnes, Karnataka 42 lakh tonnes, Tamil Nadu 12 lakh tonnes and Gujarat 10 lakh tonnes, it added.

NFCSF Managing Director Prakash Naiknavare said the current restriction on ethanol production may be relaxed to some extent as the estimated 290 lakh tonnes of sugar production at the beginning of the season is expected to increase by about 15 lakh tonnes.

NFCSF and the Indian Sugar Mills Association will jointly flag this issue with the central government, he added.

Rajnath Singh had, in 2019, approved admission of girl children to Sainik schools in a phased manner. The decision was taken following the success of the pilot project started by the Ministry of Defence in Sainik School Chhingchhip in Mizoram.

According to the Defence Ministry, the first all-girls sainik school has been inaugurated under the initiative of establishing 100 new sainik schools in partnership with NGOs/private/state government schools in all states/Union territories.

""Samvid Gurukulam Girls Sainik School is a beacon of light for girls who aspire to join the Armed Forces and serve the motherland. Under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government has given women their rightful place in the Armed Forces, which was neglected for years,"" the defence minister said on the occasion.

The objectives behind the vision of setting up of 100 new sainik schools are to provide quality education to the students in tune with the National Education Policy 2020 and give them better career opportunities, including joining the armed forces, the statement said.

What we know about the admission process


The Sainik school will have 120 seats. A written exam will be held on January 21 and selected candidates will need to attend e-counselling before a merit list is issued. Girls will be admitted in three batches."

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/study/mpower-presents-et-career-day-study-and-live-in-the-us/articleshow/106380260.cms,"According to a new report from the Institute of International Education, nearly 270,000 Indian students were studying in US higher education institutions in the academic year 2022-23. The report stated that the number of Indian students that went to the US in the 2022-23 academic year witnessed a 35% increase from the previous year, reaching an all-time high. Indian students also constitute 1/4th of the total foreign students studying in the US. For the first time since 2009-10, India has surpassed China in the number of graduate students studying in US universities.

Clearly, the United States is an attractive destination for Indian students, and this year many of them aspire to pursue high-quality international education and possibly an international career in the US.

However, the larger process of studying abroad is not always straightforward. Students often grapple with numerous questions: What makes the US the ideal study destination? How can I ensure preparedness for applications to my chosen universities? What does the visa process entail, and how should I navigate it? What funding options are available to me? How can I manage my finances effectively? And, how will a US education align with my long-term goals?

To answer all these questions and more, MPOWER Financing and the Economic Times hosted MPOWER Financing presented ‘ET Career Day: Study and Live in the USA’. This workshop took place on December 19 and covered three themes: study in the US, live in the US, and manage your study abroad finances. The workshop had three experts speak on these topics and students were able to directly engage with the experts through a live Q&A session. The experts were: Anand Cavale, Chief Growth Officer of MPOWER Financing, Rajika Bhandari, Principal of Rajika Bhandari Advisors, and the author of America Calling: A Foreign Student in a Country of Possibility and Yudi, Senior Product Manager at Auto Approve and a content creator.

U.S. Education Decoded: Scholarships, Loans, Studying and Living | ET Career Day
MPOWER Financing presented ‘ET Career Day: Study and Live in the USA’. This workshop took place on December 19 and covered three themes: study in the US, live in the US, and manage your study abroad finances. The workshop had three experts speak on these topics and students were able to directly engage with the experts through a live Q&A session. The experts were: Anand Cavale, Chief Growth Officer of MPOWER Financing, Rajika Bhandari, Principal of Rajika Bhandari Advisors, and the author of America Calling: A Foreign Student in a Country of Possibility and Yudi, Senior Product Manager at Auto Approve and a content creator.

When speaking about the crucial factors that students should consider while choosing their universities, Bhandari spoke about ‘fit’. Bhandari stated, “What I'm going to emphasise is that the impact is not so much the brand of the institution, but how well has the institution done to prepare you for your outcomes when you finish your education.” According to her, during the process of application, students tend to get fixated on the idea of rank, prestige and the brand of the institution, however, she highlighted the diversity that US higher education offers and encouraged people to choose institutions in which they will fit the best.
Both Yudi and Bhandari agree that multiple factors influence a student’s choice: location, coursework, brand, and the percentage of international students. However, for Yudi, his ultimate factor was price. Yudi stated, “I knew my budget, I knew this is what I can afford. So people who are looking or thinking about universities, you also need to look at what you can afford, and don't just go because the brand is there.” Many Indians like Yudi may not be able to afford all of the universities in the US, however, once you know what you can afford, then it is important to start looking at the other factors. Yudi said that going to the US was one of the best experiences in his life, and not only did he learn technical skills but he grew as a person. The US educational ecosystem pushed him into uncomfortable places and allowed him to meet people with whom he has built great relationships.

Cavale reiterated Yudi’s point, emphasising that no matter where a student chooses to study and live in the US, they will gain a wholesome experience. Cavale stressed the importance of all students figuring out how they will finance their education. For those lacking family support or personal savings, scholarships or assistantships are viable options. However, if a student cannot obtain those, borrowing becomes a consideration. “For those who aren’t able to get an assistantship or lack adequate means of support and even partial means of support,borrowing is an option if you're confident about your ability and the field of your study and that it is going to enhance your future career in a certain way,” said Cavale. The Chief Growth Officer of MPOWER Financing went on to talk about how MPOWER can help with funding students. “At MPOWER, for example, we'll give you a very transparent, easy-to-apply digital experience , that technically will give you up to $100,000 on a fixed interest basis, which means you will know what amount you're going to pay throughout your your education, and it doesn't vary.”
Cavale also spoke about the need for managing finances once you have made it to the US. Since many Indian students have lived at home their whole lives Cavale believes that most of them underestimate the cost of living. “I think what one needs to understand is, by and large, people underestimate their living expenses because they have lived in their hometown, under the auspices of their parents…when you go overseas, you're completely uprooting yourself and you're going to a new environment.” Anand states that it is better to have an idea of all the things you will need to pay for, including phone, transportation, and apartment rent, and keep a rough estimate of how much it will all cost, that is the only way one can start budgeting in advance.

The mindset shift
Beyond applications and universities, shifting to the US involves an entire social integration that students need to be prepared for. Bhandari said that students are generally well-informed about the application process because they undertake thorough research for it, but what they are not informed about is the change in mindset they need to integrate well into the US. “One of the things I often talk about is that it's also about really shifting your mindset, and one of the challenges and opportunities you will be confronted with right away when you land in the US, especially if you are going at the graduate level, is that there is a huge amount of independence expected of you…you will be drowning in the number of choices, the decisions that you have to make and how independently you will have to make them in the classroom from the get-go” said Bhandari. Owning your learning, advocating for yourself as an individual and thinking more independently will require a shift in your mentality. According to Bhandari, these are things that may not be spoken about commonly but are critical to defining success when you go to study abroad.
Although the US is known for the flexibility of its higher education, and many argue that it is one of the core strengths of the US higher education system, Yudi says that one of his biggest regrets looking back is not having career clarity from the get-go. Yudi advises students to have a clear idea of what they want to do and then work backward. Pick the classes, learn the skills and do the internships based on your career goals. Yudi believes that a lot of students pick classes just because everyone is doing it, and he feels that students can get lost doing that.

“Visas are very stressful for students,” says Bhandari. Her main advice to students is to prepare for a brief interview. You have to be very clear and precise and always remember that the visa you are applying for is specifically for education. That should be your primary focus for the interview.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/ambani-adani-tata-jindal-the-four-pillars-of-indian-team-boosting-modis-self-reliance-vision/articleshow/106463092.cms,"There’s a strong possibility that India, still a lower-middle-income economy, will have not one but two centi-billionaires in 2024.

The current consensus among political analysts is for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to retain power in this year’s general elections. In that case, expect a further consolidation of wealth in the hands of Mukesh Ambani, Asia’s richest businessman, and Gautam Adani, his closest rival — a validation of what Arvind Subramanian, a former economic adviser to the Modi administration, has described as India’s “2A variant of stigmatized capitalism,” in which the private sector as a whole can’t be trusted.

But while the 2As — Ambani and Adani — will be the most closely watched tycoons, they won’t be the only ones. Throw in the Tata Group, a sprawling conglomerate controlled, via charitable trusts, by 86-year-old Chairman Emeritus Ratan Tata, and steel magnate Sajjan Jindal, whose mother, Savitri Jindal, is Asia’s wealthiest businesswoman, and you have the four pillars of a national team. What distinguishes them from the rest of India Inc. is their capacity to commit to large, complex, long-gestation gambits while keeping their business goals broadly aligned with the Modi government’s slogans of self-reliance and “Make in India.”

Naturally, the biggest danger of allowing — even encouraging — a handful of business groups to aggressively branch into new areas and extend their control over large swathes of the economy is extreme concentration of power and wealth.

But the entry norms to an exclusive club can’t be kept too easy, either. After promising “a self-reliant Silicon Valley” in Modi’s home state of Gujarat, Vedanta Group’s Anil Agarwal has so far struggled to deliver a 28-nanometer fab. Foxconn, his Taiwanese partner, exited the joint venture in July. This is when the government, desperate for India to make its own semiconductors, is shouldering half the cost of such factories. Now, Agarwal’s London-based mining is busy getting bondholders to accept longer repayment periods to stay afloat amid a heavy debt burden.

The topsy-turvy 2023 for Gautam Adani: Hindenburg hit to mighty fightback

Much of the country’s overleveraged corporate sector from 2014 has perished in the past decade. Mukesh Ambani’s younger brother, Anil, whom Dassault Aviation SA had selected as a local partner when Modi gave the French firm an order for 36 fighter jets early in his first term, told a London court in 2020 that his net worth was zero.

Which is why a smaller national team helps. The Tata Group, having become the first Indian iPhone maker, may be a more credible choice for the nation’s slow ascent up the global electronics value chain. The conglomerate is also reviving Air India Ltd., the loss-making national carrier that it won in a 2021 privatization deal. When Air India announced an order for 470 aircraft in February, potentially the biggest in aviation history, it gave the government a valuable diplomatic tool to project the country’s image as a buyer of growing heft.

Similarly, Adani, India’s largest port operator, now appears to be an important partner — to both New Delhi and Washington — in countering China’s Belt-and-Road offensive. Last January, with his fortune under attack from a New York-based short seller, the 61-year-old posed for cameras with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel’s Haifa Port, which he had come to buy for $1.2 billion. In November, a US government agency announced $553 million in financing — its largest infrastructure investment so far in Asia — for Adani’s deepwater West Container Terminal in Colombo, Sri Lanka, a strategically important gateway to the Indian Ocean.

Then there is clean energy. New Delhi fears that a move away from fossil fuels might make it overly dependent on Chinese equipment. Jindal, the chairman of JSW Steel Ltd., the country’s largest steelmaker, wants to help. After pledging to make a top-end electric car, he recently bought a 35% stake in a joint venture with China’s SAIC Motor Corp. It was looking increasingly tough for SAIC’s MG Motor brand to stay independent in India, given the intense scrutiny of Chinese-owned enterprises by local authorities. But for the 64-year-old Jindal to venture into auto, he must first sort out the legal troubles that cropped up after the deal was announced. The businessman is being investigated by police after a woman accused him of sexual assault, an allegation he has denied.

Market wrap: Property wins big, Adani lags in stellar year for Indian stocks

Adani’s legal and regulatory troubles over alleged share-price manipulation, violation of listing rules, and undisclosed related-party transactions are mostly in the rearview mirror. His latest move is to infuse fresh capital into renewable energy, where he’s already the country’s No. 1 producer. As for proximity to Modi, which Adani says he has never used to gain an unfair advantage, only a surprise victory for the Congress Party-led alliance of opposition parties could put it under scrutiny. Investors, though, have all but discounted that risk after the prime minister’s party won key state polls in northern India earlier this month. Adani Enterprises shares jumped 25% over two days. For the first time, the capitalization of the overall Indian market swelled to $4 trillion.

That gives a taste of what to expect if Modi wins a third term. Assuming an unchanged political landscape, what investors will want from the national team in 2024 is a here-and-now recipe for value creation. Ambani, 66, needs to take his telecom and retail units public, take control of Walt Disney Co.’s Indian media assets, and start commercial production at his new solar-module factory. Tata will have to show that it can make a go of its expensive super-app ambition and turn Air India around. Jindal will have to demonstrate that his personal legal troubles won’t stymie expansion — not just in electric cars, but also in cement and ports, where his interests may collide against Adani’s.

Adani’s most visible undertaking in 2024 will be a controversial makeover of a large Mumbai shantytown. Under the deal, future skyscrapers in the commercial capital may have to pay billions of dollars to his project. Builders are grumbling, but Adani investors can’t wait for the cash registers to start ringing.

Now that Adani has seen off the short-seller attack that cratered the equity value of his infrastructure empire by two-thirds earlier this year, the 2As are within striking distance of each other on global wealth rankings — Ambani’s net worth of $96 billion puts him just $12 billion ahead. With an assured political runway for stigmatized capitalism, one or both may soon be centi-billionaires. This in a country where 800 million people still depend on free food from the government to get by.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/indias-oct-dec-sugar-output-drops-7-6-y/y-industry-body/articleshow/106483552.cms,"Indian mills produced 11.21 million metric tons of sugar between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31, down 7.6% from the previous year, on lower production in key producing states Maharashtra and Karnataka, a leading industry body said on Tuesday.

Maharashtra's sugar production fell to 3.82 million tons from 4.74 million, while Karnataka's production dropped 10.1% to 2.4 million tons, the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories said in a statement.

Production in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh rose 12.5% to 3.5 million tons as mills started operations early, it said.

India's sugar output this crop year, hit by weak rains, is set to lag consumption for the first time in seven years, according to traders and a survey of farmers, and lower plantings may even force the world's No.2 producer to import the following year.

India has decided to allow sugar mills to divert up to 1.7 million tons of sugar for ethanol production as New Delhi aims to reduce disruptions in its ambitious biofuel programme.

With Prime Minister Narendra Modi facing election next year, India, which is highly sensitive to food inflation, is likely to ban sugar exports, the first restriction on exports since 2016.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/truckers-protest-panic-buying-of-petrol-diesel-and-lpg-cylinders-in-punjab/articleshow/106483404.cms,"Motorists queued up at fuel stations at many places in Punjab and Haryana on Tuesday over fears that stocks would run dry soon with truckers keeping off the roads to protest stricter punishments in the new law on hit-and-run cases. In Haryana, private bus operators and some auto-rickshaw unions have also joined the protest against the new provision and some petrol pumps in Ambala reported a shortage of fuel. Chandigarh, the common capital of the twin states, too saw vehicle owners panic-buying fuel.

Under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, which is set to replace the colonial-era Indian Penal Code, drivers who cause serious road accidents due to negligent driving and run away without informing police or the administration face up to 10 years in prison or a fine of Rs 7 lakh.

Truckers in several states launched a three-day protest against the ""stringent provision"" on Monday. The situation in Punjab on the second day of the agitation prompted the petroleum dealers association to shoot off a letter to the government over the ""panic buying"" situation in fuel stations affecting stock supplies.

Secretary general of the Punjab Petroleum Dealers Association Rajesh Kumar said there are nearly 4,000 petrol pumps in the state and fuel supply has been affected due to the agitation since Monday.

""As the news spread that truck drivers were holding protests and have gone on strike, people rushed to fuel stations... We are also not getting replenishment of stocks due to the strike... As these drivers are holding protests, they are also not allowing oil tankers to enter depots to get fuel stocks,"" he alleged.

""If this situation continues, we are staring at a dry-out situation soon which prompted us to write a letter to the Punjab chief minister...,"" Kumar added.

Ravinder Singh Khalsa, a truck driver, said they are demanding the withdrawal of the ""stringent provisions"" in the new law.

""The new law is against the interest of drivers. Nobody intentionally wants to injure or cause anyone's death, but accidents happen. In such cases, people turn against the driver and sometimes the mob damages the vehicle and causes harm to the driver too. We demand that the new law be amended,"" truck operator Sushil Kumar added.

In Ludhiana, the supply of goods has also been affected as truck drivers protested on highways, according to Pankaj Sharma, secretary of the Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertaking.

""The transport of consignments to different places has already been badly hit,"" he added.

Sanjeev Garg, a petrol pump owner in Ludhiana, said he would continue selling fuel till his stock ran out. He said he had not received any fresh supply of fuel since Monday.

Long queues were witnessed at cooking gas agency offices as well. There was panic-buying of gas cylinders as people were apprehensive of its shortage if the strike continued longer.

With trucks, tempos and containers keeping off the roads, the supply of fruits and vegetables is also likely to be impacted, according to some traders.

In Haryana's Ambala, some petrol stations have already reported a shortage of petrol and diesel as no fresh supply has been received in the last two days, the president of the petroleum dealers association Ravinder Singh Dhillon said.

He said fuel is supplied to the region from Rewari, Hisar and Panipat depots but various truck unions were not letting tankers supply fresh petrol and diesel stocks.

""The oil tankers have been stranded there for the last two days. Most of the petrol pumps have stocks for hardly one or two days. If the supply is not restored immediately, we will have to shut down the pumps,"" Dhillon said.

A petrol pump owner in Ambala City Rajesh Khosla said he would have to shut down by the evening if supply was not restored.

The raids are being carried out under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), the sources said.

About four-five premises are being covered by the ED officials, they said.

The agency had in October raided the premises of the 49-year-old legislator who represents the Okhla constituency in the Delhi assembly. It had also arrested three of his alleged associates in this case in November.

The ED had alleged that Khan acquired ""huge proceeds of crime"" in cash from illegal recruitment of staff in the Delhi Waqf Board and invested these for purchasing immovable assets in the name of his associates.

""The searches (in October) were conducted in the case related to illegal recruitment of staff in Delhi Waqf Board and illegal personal gains by way of unfairly leasing out of Waqf Board properties during the chairmanship of the board by Amantullah Khan during 2018-2022,"" the agency had claimed in a statement.

It said a CBI FIR and three Delhi Police complaints formed the basis of the ED action against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA.

Khan, the ED said, ""acquired huge proceeds of crime out of the said criminal activities in cash and this cash amount was invested in purchase of various immovable properties in Delhi in the name of his associates.""

Several ""incriminating"" materials in the form of physical and digital evidence were seized during the raids which ""indicate"" the role of Khan in the offence of money laundering, it said.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had alleged there was a campaign underway to end the AAP and asserted that false cases are being filed against party leaders.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/pil-in-sc-challenges-new-law-on-appointment-of-cec-ecs-seeks-independent-transparent-system/articleshow/106484576.cms,"Amid a political row over dropping the Chief Justice of India (CJI) from a panel empowered to choose the chief election commissioner and election commissioners, an advocate has moved the Supreme Court, seeking quashing of the new law that accords the central government sweeping powers to to make appointments to the poll body. The plea filed by advocate Gopal Singh has sought the apex court's direction to implement an ""independent and transparent system of selection, constituting a neutral and independent selection committee for appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and Election Commissioners (CEC and ECs)"".

While dropping the CJI from the selection committee, the new law said ""Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners shall be appointed by the President on the recommendation of a Selection Committee consisting of-(a) the Prime Minister-Chairperson; (b) the Leader of Opposition in the House of the People-Member; (c) a Union Cabinet Minister to be nominated by the Prime Minister-Member.""

The opposition has accused the Modi government of having defied the Supreme Court by dropping the CJI from the selection panel.

In its March 2023 order, the Supreme Court had said the prime minister, the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha, and the CJI will pick the CEC and the election commissioners.

Singh, in his Public Interest Litigation (PIL), has sought an order from the apex court to injunct the implementation of the gazette notification of December 28, 2023 relating to the Chief Election Commissioner and the other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Condition of Service and Term of Office) Act, 2023.

""The pivotal legal question placed for the court's consideration in the writ petition revolves around the constitutional inquiry of whether the Parliament or any legislative assembly possesses the authority to promulgate a gazette notification or ordinance to nullify or amend a judgment previously rendered by the Supreme Court, particularly when the judgment emanates from a Constitution Bench,"" the PIL says.

The plea seeks inclusion of the CJI in the selection committee for the appointment of the CEC and ECs.

The Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Act, 2023 has provisions to set up a search committee chaired by the union law minister and two other persons not below the rank of secretary to prepare a panel of five persons for consideration of the selection committee for appointment as CEC or ECs.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/five-nations-become-full-members-of-brics/articleshow/106483352.cms,"The BRICS bloc of top emerging economies, including India, Russia and China, has announced induction of five full members into it as part of an attempt to expand its strategic heft against the backdrop of Western dominance in world affairs. As Moscow assumed the presidency of BRICS, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that the grouping has become a 10-nation body now with Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates joining it as new members.

In August, the top BRICS leaders at the grouping's summit in Johannesburg approved a proposal to admit six countries, including Argentina, into the bloc with effect from January 1.

However, Argentina's new President Javier Milei last week announced withdrawing his country from becoming a member of the BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa).

""Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates joined BRICS as new full members which is a strong indication of the growing authority of the association and its role in international affairs,"" Putin said in an address.

The Russian President said BRICS is attracting an ever increasing number of supporters and like-minded countries that share its underlying principles such as sovereign equality, openness, consensus, aspiration to form a multipolar international order and a fair global financial and trading system.

The grouping took shape in September 2006 and it originally comprised Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC). It was renamed as BRICS after South Africa was accepted as a full member in September 2010.

With Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa as its members, BRICS represents a quarter of the global economy and it has been a major engine of global economic growth over the years.

In his remarks, Putin said Russian 2024 BRICS chairmanship under the motto 'strengthening multilateralism for equitable global development and security' will focus on positive and constructive cooperation with all concerned countries.

""We will spare no effort to ensure that, while preserving traditions and being guided by the experience gained by the association in years past, we facilitate the harmonious integration of new participants in all formats of its activities,"" he said, according to the Kremlin.

""Of course, we will consider the degree to which many other countries, about 30 of them, are prepared to join the BRICS multi-dimensional agenda in one form or another,"" he said. To this end, we will start working on the modalities of a new category of BRICS partner countries, he said.

""In general, Russia will continue to promote all aspects of the BRICS partnership in three key areas: politics and security, economy and finance, and cultural and humanitarian contacts,"" he said.

""Naturally, we will focus on enhancing foreign policy coordination among the member countries and on jointly seeking effective responses to the challenges and threats to international and regional security and stability,"" he said.

Putin said the priorities under the Russian presidency of the grouping will include promoting cooperation in science, high technology, healthcare, environmental protection, culture and sports.

""In total, over 200 events of different levels and types will be held in many Russian cities as part of the chairmanship,"" he said.

""We encourage representatives of all countries interested in cooperating with our organisation to take part in them. The BRICS Summit in Kazan in October will be the culmination of our chairmanship,"" he added.

In the financial year 2023, the company's consolidated revenue from operations rose 25% year-on-year to Rs 255 crore, primarily attributed to an increase in revenue from welding consumables, wear plates, and from trading activities. This increase was majorly due to an increase in the production mix and an increase in the volume of units sold in these products.

Profit after tax for the same period rose 30% to Rs 22.14 crore. In the last ten years, revenue from operations and PAT have registered a CAGR of 12.03% and 9.7%, respectively.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently proposed a ban on these chemicals in such products, a move that has garnered support from doctors in India, a TOI report stated.

Dr. Pragya Shukla, a clinical oncologist at the Delhi State Cancer Institute, told TOI about the serious health risks associated with formaldehyde, classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the National Toxicology Programme. Dr. Shukla emphasized the increased risk of nasopharyngeal and sinonasal cancers as well as leukemia.

One major concern is the inhalation of formaldehyde fumes during the hair straightening process, a common practice in India. Dr. Shukla pointed out, ""The fumes released during the process are inhaled by the user and can increase the risk of cancer if being used frequently.""

Dr. Kabir Sardana, a dermatologist at RML Hospital, highlighted data linking hair relaxers to uterine and breast cancer, especially with prolonged use exceeding 15 years and at least five times a year. Dr. Sardana urged caution, stating, ""While no single factor can cause cancer, this is a simple modifiable risk factor, and thus such procedures should be avoided.""

Recognizing both immediate and cumulative impacts of formaldehyde exposure, Dr. Sajjan Rajpurohit, senior director of medical oncology at BLK Super Specialty Hospital, outlined short-term effects, including sensitization reactions, eye irritations, nose and throat discomfort, and breathing problems. He emphasized the long-term association with an elevated risk of breast and uterine cancer, calling for swift regulatory action to mitigate these risks.

Dr. Raajit Chanana, senior consultant of medical oncology at Dharamshila Narayana Superspecialty Hospital, underscored the importance of identifying and addressing carcinogenic agents in everyday products to prevent potential cancer cases. He expressed support for initiatives like the FDA's ban, recognizing the critical role of stringent regulations in minimizing cancer risks.

Dr. Arpana Jain, director of obstetrics and gynecology at Fortis Hospital Shalimar Bagh, advised caution in choosing hair products due to the increased absorption of chemicals on the scalp. A study led by Alexandra White estimated a higher risk of uterine cancer among frequent users of hair straighteners, emphasizing the need for awareness and careful product selection.

As the debate over the safety of hair-straightening chemicals continues, health experts in India join the global call for regulatory measures to safeguard public health and minimize the risks associated with these products.

""The yellow metal's appeal as a safe haven investment and a perfect hedge against inflation is likely to continue in 2024 as consumers face high commodity prices and elevated interest rates worldwide thus overheating financial markets, GJC chairman Saiyam Mehra said in a statement.

Economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions suggest a rise in gold prices, which emphasises gold as a vital portfolio hedge during downturns and the prices are likely to see an upsurge of USD 2,300 an ounce or Rs 70,000 per 10 grams in 2024, he said.

""If economic conditions worsen, driving increased demand for defensive assets, gold prices could rise, offering a potential upside beyond all past predictions,"" he added.

In 2023, gold outperformed other investment products as safe-haven buying triggered by the United States interest rate pause, geopolitical uncertainties, and high inflation amid a global economic slowdown, Mehra noted.

With 13 per cent returns, gold continued to be the most attractive investment option in 2023, he stated.

The precious metal saw uninterrupted buying interest from investors, supported by a recent rally in the equity markets during the Christmas season.

Consumers' appetite was seen throughout the year across all forms of gold products, such as physical, bonds, and paper gold.

""Gold has been a timeless allure for Indian consumers following a similar trend overseas, reaching an all-time high record of Rs 64,460 per 10 grams during this year and outshined other asset classes in 2023. In the international markets, spot gold surpassed the previous record high of USD 2,081 an ounce,"" Mehra said.

This signifies that consumers' appetite for gold is growing and with continuing the global economic uncertainty the prices will certainly catapult gold to much higher levels in 2024, he added."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/work/h-1b-visa-domestic-renewal-how-to-apply-and-what-happens-if-your-application-is-denied/articleshow/106483857.cms,"For several years until mid-June 2004, the U.S. Department of State (DOS) re-issued visas for certain non-immigrant workers within the U.S. After almost ten years, the DOS has initiated a pilot program to reinstate this facility. The scope of this pilot program is limited to certain categories, as highlighted in an earlier article published by the Economic Times. In this article, we will address some of the details pertinent to this pilot program and related issues.

Under the new pilot program, eligible applicants will be required to apply on a dedicated DOS portal that will become operational closer to the opening date. The DOS portal will first require a self-guided assessment to determine eligibility before the applicant can complete the standard Form DS-160 nonimmigrant visa application and pay the requisite US$205 non-refundable application fee. All fees must be paid online by debit or credit card.

Demand for the pilot program is expected to be very high, and application slots are limited. It is important to prepare in advance to avail of this benefit as soon as the program begins accepting applications. Application filing slots will be made available weekly on the following dates:
- January 29, 2024
- February 5, 2024

The DOS will only accept up to 4,000 applications per week – with a limit of 2,000 from applicants with visas issued by a U.S. Consulate in India and 2,000 from applicants with visasa visa issued by a U.S. Consulate in Canada. The application website will be closed when the DOS receives applications to meet these limits and will be reopened on the next date when the next batch of 4,000 applications, as per these limits, will be accepted.

Once the fee is paid on the website, applicants will receive instructions to submit their passport and the following supporting documents to the DOS:
Completed and electronically filed Form DS-160;
One recent passport-size photograph that meets DOS specifications;
Passport with at least six months validity beyond the visa application date and containing at least one blank, unmarked page;
A copy of the applicant’s valid, unexpired USCIS H-1B petition approval, Form I-797; and
A copy of the applicant’s valid, unexpired Form I-94 arrival record.

These documents must be submitted via U.S. mail (USPS) or commercial courier service.

Once the DOS receives these documents along with the passport, it will once again assess the application. If the application is deficient or the DOS determines that the applicant is ineligible, the application will be returned. However, the application fee will not be refunded.

The anticipated processing time is 6 to 8 weeks from the time the DOS receives the application but could take longer. It is not possible to expedite or request premium processing for these applications. If, during the processing period, an applicant needs to travel overseas, he or she may withdraw the application and ask for the passport to be returned. If an application is withdrawn, it will be considered a “visa refusal” (and the visa fee will not be refunded), though this refusal will not have a prejudicial effect on future applications.

The DOS expects that all the qualified applications under the pilot program will be adjudicated by May 1, 2024.

An application may be denied if (1) the application is incomplete, (2) if the DOS determines that an applicant is not eligible for the pilot program, or (3) if additional security screening is required. If an application is denied, the foreign national will need to apply for visa renewal at a U.S. Consulate abroad by filing a new Form DS-160 application and by paying another application fee.

The DOS may allow an applicant to cure minor defects, such as missing documents, minor errors, or missing information. However, missing information or corrective steps must be taken by April 15, 2024, in order to overcome the defect before the pilot program closes.

The pilot program is a great opportunity for eligible foreign nationals to renew an H-1B visa within the U.S. It helps avoid the need to travel abroad and face the potential uncertainties and delays at a U.S. Consulate. However, since the pilot program does not extend to family members who are on H-4 visas, it is a challenge, as H-4 visas can only be issued at a U.S. Consulate abroad.

Though the initial pilot program is limited in scope and duration, the DOS has indicated that it expects to eventually expand the pilot program to new visa categories and countries of visa issuance."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/were-expectations-of-fii-flows-coming-back-with-a-bang-in-2024-misplaced-shibani-sircar-kurian-answers/articleshow/106484986.cms,"Shibani Sircar Kurian, Senior EVP, Sr. Fund Manager & Head -Equity Research, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management, says “We are not expecting to see any major earnings downgrades. But if you look at the first half of the year, in terms of earnings, the first half of the year has been extremely strong. And from that pace, you might see some amount of slowdown on a quarterly basis. However, we do not expect to see major earnings downgrades. In FY25, earnings expectations continue to remain fairly healthy in the mid to high teens, which is again supporting Indian markets and valuations. ”

Kurian also says: “We do believe that India still remains fairly favourable in the emerging market context. Globally, if interest rates come down, that's also favourable for the emerging market pack as well. And therefore, from that perspective, India continues to remain fairly impressive in the relative EM pack.”


In the last week of December, everybody seemed to be of the opinion that let January come and then FII flows will come back. Yes, the dollar index has fallen. Yes, the acceleration in flows have been seen in the last few weeks, but it does not happen like clockwork. If they have to come, they will come with their own ease and not exactly 1st of Jan, 2nd of Jan. Every day there has to be a buy figure from the FII side. So expectations of this sort perhaps were misplaced?
Shibani Sircar Kurian: As you are rightly pointing out, it is not that it works on a particular date or a time in terms of a clockwork sort of a reaction. However, when you look at the flows that we have been getting, especially where India is standing out in a relative context to the emerging market pack, given the fact that our macro as well as our earnings growth trajectory, both at an absolute as well as relative basis has been extremely strong.

So if you look at 2023, for me, the standout feature was that unlike many years in the past, where we saw earnings downgrades, earnings actually got upgraded. Therefore, when you look at India's valuations in context to return ratios, as well as earnings growth in the entire emerging market pack, India clearly stands out. However, for an FII or for anyone investing into India, they look at India in the global context and therefore valuations do play a role.

In that context, when you look at India's valuations on a relative basis, India continues to remain expensive. However, our belief is that given India's performance on the earning side, as well as macro stability, as well as growth valuations will typically always be at a premium. And therefore, we should look at India more on a PEG basis rather than just a PE basis.

Therefore, we do believe that India still remains fairly favourable in the emerging market context. Globally, if interest rates come down, that's also favourable for the emerging market pack as well. And therefore, from that perspective, India continues to remain fairly impressive in the relative EM pack.

Yes, the market move has been in tandem with the kind of earnings upgrade that we have seen as well. But the question is, is the pace of upgrades going to slow down materially and perhaps the cycle would reverse in the sense that there might be some downgrades that might start? I ask that question because the early commentary that we've got from the FMCG players or the IT players or even autos for that matter is not showing that amount of strength right now. Do you think at the end of the Q3, there might be more downgrades than upgrades?
Shibani Sircar Kurian: We are not expecting to see any major earnings downgrades. But if you look at the first half of the year, in terms of earnings, the first half of the year has been extremely strong. And from that pace, you might see some amount of slowdown on a quarterly basis. However, we do not expect to see major earnings downgrades. And if you look into the next year as such, which is FY25, earnings expectations continue to remain fairly healthy in the mid to high teens, which is again supporting Indian markets and valuations.

What we need to watch out for is one, so far earnings have been predominantly led by domestic businesses, which are still holding up well. The second sector, which has also been a key contributor to earnings has been the banking sector. Here, incrementally, we are seeing some degree of margin pressure and therefore, you need to moderate earnings from that perspective. But banking still will continue to remain one of the large contributors to the overall profit pool, if you look at the markets.

The third aspect that we need to watch out for is unlike the previous year, which is FY23, FY24 has seen a more broad-based earnings trajectory. So, more sectors are contributing to the overall earnings pie. So, at this point in time, given that the outlook on earnings remains fairly intact, we do not expect to see major earnings downgrades for 24. Of course, we will have to wait and watch and see commentary going into FY25, especially where consumption, discretionary consumption goes and IT. These could be two large spaces where one can see some improvement going into FY25 and that could help support earnings as well.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/whatsapp-users-to-soon-lose-free-google-drive-storage-access-heres-what-you-can-do/articleshow/106483248.cms,"WhatsApp, the globally used messaging app, is bringing about a significant change as it bids adieu to the era of free Google Drive storage for chat backups. As the New Year unfolds, users are faced with an impending deadline, prompting a shift in how they manage their cherished chats and memories.

The Shift In Google Drive Storage Dynamics
Android users have long enjoyed the convenience of storing their WhatsApp conversations on Google Drive without denting their 15GB free storage allotment. However, this practice is set to change this year. The change is already affecting WhatsApp Beta users with the latest beta updates and will soon roll out to all other users too.

The shift aligns Android with iPhone's iCloud storage limitations, where Google Drive's 15GB free storage will soon be impacted by WhatsApp backups.

While Google and WhatsApp haven't explicitly disclosed the reasons for this modification, it's speculated that the increasing user base on WhatsApp may have made offering free cloud storage impractical.

The Google One Subscription Solution
With the imminent change, users dependent on Google Drive for safeguarding their valuable data must consider investing in Google One subscriptions.

Google One offers three subscription levels - Basic (100GB), Standard (200GB), and Premium (2TB) - catering to various storage needs, available on a monthly or annual basis.

Google One Plans
Basic (100GB) comes at £1.59 / $1.99 per month, Standard (200GB) at £2.49 / $2.99, and Premium (2TB) at £7.99 / $9.99 monthly.

Annual plans offer additional savings, with the Basic plan at £15.99 / $19.99, Standard at £24.99 / $29.99, and Premium at £79.99 / $99.99. Prices for India are yet to be disclosed.

Explore Alternatives Without Paying
For those reluctant to opt for Google One, WhatsApp provides alternatives within the app. Users can navigate to Settings, then Storage and Data, and finally choose Manage Storage.

Here, WhatsApp offers various techniques to efficiently minimise storage usage, ensuring users maximise their complimentary 15GB allotment without incurring extra expenses.

WhatsApp Chat Transfer Tool
WhatsApp users also have the option to use the WhatsApp Chat Transfer tool to move conversations across Android devices without relying on Google Drive. This ensures flexibility in data management, offering users choices beyond the impending changes.

Meanwhile, users can continue backing up their data for free as long as they have available storage within the 15GB of free cloud storage included with their Google Account or any additional purchased storage, such as through Google One."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/c-suite/how-hiring-and-firing-changed-in-the-corner-office-in-2023-and-what-to-expect-in-2024/articleshow/106484856.cms,"The year 2023 has seen quite a few learnings for the world of jobs and careers. Even as people got ready for the shift from remote work to back to office and hybrid work environments, the global market conditions, technology shifts and funding scenario also led to shifts in hiring patterns and increased layoffs in certain sectors. What were some of the most critical lessons when it came to hiring and firing?

Overall hiring shifts:
Jaideep Kewalramani, COO & Head of Employability, TeamLease Edtech says recruitment saw a boost with technology. He highlighted trends such as the integration of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning has revolutionized the recruitment process. Automated screening tools, chatbots, and algorithmic assessments are streamlining the initial stages of hiring, enabling recruiters to sift through large volumes of resumes efficiently. “This not only expedites the hiring process but also ensures a more objective evaluation of candidates based on merit and skills,” he adds.

Industry specific shifts for CEO level hiring:
Mr Harold D’Souza, Co-Founder and Director, WalkWater Talent Advisors, Executive Search and Talent Advisory Company shares, “Consumer related industries saw relative stability and new CEO hiring was not very high except in new promoter driven entities. Government spending contributed to the growth of manufacturing and infrastructure industries in India and the latter part of the year saw some big hires in Energy, Manufacturing and Infrastructure, especially in new Energy. The BFSI industry saw some big CEO hires largely driven by ending tenures as per regulations, but some hires in new age Fintechs were driven by business model changes. Fintech as an industry emerged as a big employer and a new generation of leaders will emerge from this sector.”

The clear trends in CEO hiring according to D’Souza are around movement to larger diversity and inclusion focus, greater stress of sustainability and environmental impact and a move towards a deeper understanding of technology especially new areas like Gen AI and its application. He feels that there is also a better awareness of India’s emergence as a go-to economy with a bigger presence in the world.

Kewalramani adds that as businesses undergo rapid growth and transformations, organizations are placing a greater emphasis on reskilling and upskilling initiatives. Instead of resorting to mass layoffs during periods of change, companies are investing in the development of their existing workforce. This proactive approach not only ensures employee retention but also contributes to a more agile and adaptable organizational culture. Employers are leveraging the gig economy and searching for innovative gig models to tap a seasonal and on demand workforce. Simultaneously, workers are finding new avenues for professional growth through diverse and dynamic engagements.

“While technical skills remain crucial, the spotlight is increasingly shifting towards soft skills. The remote work environment demands effective communication, collaboration, and emotional intelligence. Employers are recognizing the importance of these attributes in fostering a cohesive and productive virtual work environment. Consequently, hiring decisions are being influenced by a candidate's ability to navigate the complexities of the changed workplace environment. Also, HR heads are embracing work-integrated degree programs to transform talent acquisition and development. ” he adds.

Human-Centric Approach to Firing:
Kewalramani also adds that on the flip side, the concept of firing or letting go of employees has undergone a transformation as well. Best-in-class organizations are adopting a more human-centric approach, recognizing the impact of job loss on individuals. Outplacement services, career counseling, and support systems are being integrated into the termination process, aiming to assist employees in their transition to new opportunities. This empathetic approach not only safeguards the well-being of departing employees but also contributes to a positive employer brand. However, not all companies are following these best practices when it comes to firing and layoffs.

D’Souza shares that at the senior levels, CEO exits were largely in Tech and related areas, not only in India but globally.

Outlook for 2024:
“Our view is that 2024 will see a boom in senior hiring, if there are no other black swan moments. Funding will increase, start ups will see renewed energy , and focus and also learn from past mistakes. The Indian economy especially post the election results will see a big boost and this will result in Indian companies hiring bigger global leadership for new business to lead their ambitious growth plans. The IPO rush of late 2023 will continue post election and this in turn will again lead to more CEO hires.” D’Souza concludes.

He was one of only 14 Indians to participate last year.

Ajmera, a passionate athlete who has been running for more than 15 years, says participating in the Ironman triathlon is something that has been on his mind for the last three years. “I was just unsure if I should go for it,” he shares. But after talking to friends who have successfully completed the challenge, Ajmera decided to take the plunge.

“I strongly believe that the human body has the capacity to take up the toughest challenges, be it an endurance race, a professional pursuit or something else,” he says.
Prepping Your Mind
Any marathoner will tell you that running a marathon comes down to mental fortitude – if you can conquer your mind, everything else gets easier.

Ajmera says he began his Ironman prep by mapping a route to victory. “Post registration, I sat down with the end goal (to complete this test of endurance) and all I would need to work around to achieving my goal. The answer that emerged was strict time management,” he recalls. “I did a lot of planning to ensure that my work would never suffer because this race would require a lot of training. Somewhere, something needed to be sacrificed. I had to give up a lot on the social front. I cut that off my list and made training my main focus. That’s how I was able to prepare well without compromising my professional commitments (or burning out). When your mind and body are in sync and stable, the decision-making is even clearer and better.”

And spirituality has a role to play here, he says, it helps you keep calm. “Yes, the triathlon is an achievement of mental strength, but at the same time, spirituality helped me better calm my mind and be more focused.”
Prepping Your Body
Ajmera is a marathoner – “which has helped me maintain my stamina and body levels well” – but preparing for a triathlon of this calibre requires stringent training under expert guidance, he says. “I had a specialised Ironman coach who designed a holistic training program that required me to work out six days a week; it would be on average one to one and a half hours of training every day and longer on weekends. There was a swim coach, a strength trainer, a nutritionist and a physiotherapist to help me prepare well for the race and ensure risk mitigation.”

Since Ajmera is a vegetarian, focusing on optimum protein intake was paramount. Ajmera says he worked with a nutritionist to develop a high protein-low carb diet that would help him build muscle and gain enough stamina to endure the intensive workouts (swimming once a week, strength training twice a week)."

The agency had started the preliminary enquiry on the directions of the Central Vigilance Commission in 2012 where a complaint was filed by then Congress MP Sandeep Dikshit and six other then MPs alleging irregularities in the allocation of coal blocks during the period 1993-2005.

On the basis of findings of its inquiry, the agency had deemed it fit to convert it into an FIR.

However after four years of probe, the CBI has filed a closure report before a special court on December 23, 2023 as it did not find enough evidence to file a charge sheet.

The CBI enquiry had ""revealed"" that at the 13th meeting of the screening committee on August 24, 1988 it was decided to allocate Kilhoni block to NDIL and include the block in the list of blocks for captive mining.

The agency alleged that the notification issued by the Coal Ministry in this regard was ""neither in conformity"" with the guidelines for coal mining by associated coal companies ""nor with the allocation letter issued to NDIL"".

""Even the coal ministry officials had not mentioned the name of NDIL in the issued notification, although the coal block has been allocated to NDIL by the Screening Committee.

""Also the Kilhoni Block was not in the list of identified coal blocks for captive mining and the apex committee of CIL did not agree for allocation of this block to NDIL,"" the FIR had alleged.

""The 12th Screening Committee had not agreed for allocation of Kilhoni Block, Maharashtra to NDIL even then 13th SC allocated it to NDIL even though the block was included in the list of blocks for captive mining,"" it had alleged.

""The...information discloses that Nippon Denro Ispat Ltd along with unidentified public servants in a criminal conspiracy cheated the Government of India and committed offences punishable under 120-B (criminal conspiracy) read with 420 (cheating) and...Prevention of Corruption Act,"" the FIR had alleged.

The toll in the incident increased to four after one more person succumbed to injuries, while two other critically injured persons were undergoing treatment at the ICU of an Imphal-based hospital, he said.

Unidentified gunmen in camouflage uniforms descended on Lilong Chingjao to ""extort money"" from a person on Monday night, leading to an altercation. While they were being chased away by locals, the gunmen opened indiscriminate fire leading to the casualties, he said.

""After the incident, tension was high on Monday night but holding of an inter-faith meeting by civil society leaders and Lilong MLA Abdul Nasir and Chief Minister N Biren Singh's assurance that the culprits will be arrested and punished as per the law defused the situation,"" the official said.

Additional security forces have been deployed in the area and vehicular patrolling has been increased to prevent any untoward incident, he said.

Meanwhile, with curfew being imposed in five districts of Imphal Valley in view of the ""prevailing law and order situation"", few vehicles were seen plying roads as most commercial establishments remained closed.

The deceased, whose bodies were brought to Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences in Imphal for post-mortem examination, were identified as Md Daulat (30), M Sirajuddin (50), Md Azad Khan (40) and Md Hussain (22), the official said.

Ten others were injured in the incident and are currently undergoing treatment at another hospital in Imphal. Four of them received gunshot wounds, and of the four, two are in ICU while two others are under observation of doctors, he said.

After the attack, enraged locals set fire to four vehicles in which the attackers had arrived. It was not immediately clear to whom those belong.

Following the violence, curfew was imposed in Thoubal, Imphal East and Imphal West, Kakching and Bishnupur districts.

In a video message, CM Singh condemned the violence, and appealed to people, particularly the residents of Lilong, to maintain peace.

""Police are working to arrest those behind the attack. They will be arrested soon and punished as per the law,"" he said.

Local MLA Abdul Nasir said officials concerned have apprised him of the situation, and that the culprits will be nabbed soon.

Addressing the media, Yechury said that the Constitution clearly defines secularism as the separation of religion from politics and the state.

He said that the inauguration of the temple represents an overt politicisation of religion, which contradicts the principles of the Constitution.

""Here, this function, the inauguration is going to be done by the Prime Minister of India in the presence of the UP Chief Minister and those who hold other Constitutional positions. We feel this is a gross misuse of the religious sentiments of the people for their (BJP) political purposes. This is the open politicisation of religion which is not in consonance with the Constitution or the Supreme Court rulings,"" Yechury said.

He said the strategy to counter this politicisation was to strictly adhere to secularism.

""You cannot combat this sort of religious fundamentalism of all these Hindutva offences by being a soft Hindutva or a soft saffron approach,"" the senior Left leader said.

The Ram temple will be inaugurated on January 22, where PM Modi, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and more than 6,000 people are expected to attend the grand ""Pran Pratistha"" ceremony.

Yechury also attacked the BJP-led NDA government on various aspects, including the issue of surveillance and the alleged failure of the economy.

Referring to the recent issue of Apple phone notifications in connection with intrusion or monitoring of handsets, he said, ""this is a surveillance state that has been put in place"" and it was not merely an intrusion into our privacy, which it is, but it is much more than that.

""It is a surveillance state where everything is being monitored. Even conversations,"" he added.

The Left leader rubbished the BJP's claim of a ""vibrant economy"" and termed it as propaganda.

""As far as people are concerned, the last 10 years is the worst as far as their livelihood is concerned. Unemployment is at the highest. This government has been doing a lot of data fudging. Manipulation of data. And now they have added a new category to the employment of unpaid labour,"" Yechury said.

He claimed that there is an inability for the industry to grow in the country due to lack of domestic demand.

""As far as the industry is concerned, its inability to grow is because of the lack of domestic demand. People don't have the money or purchasing power. For the bulk of the Indian people, their actual purchasing power is declining. And when there is no demand, there are no future investments,"" he said.

Yechury said that as per the government's own projection for this fiscal year, the proposals for new investments have come down by more than 70 per cent, both in the private and governmental sectors.

The Left leader also pointed out that in terms of per capita income, India is at 142nd position out of the 180 countries.

""We have the lowest per capita income of all the G20 countries. We have the lowest HDI. The people's miseries are growing; unemployment, price rise, hunger index etc but the Central government dismisses all the global indices,"" Yechury said.

He said with the current situation of the working people, their struggle will intensify and will impact the 2024 elections.

The NSE Nifty IT Index of 10 software majors has surged about 17% since late October, beating the NSE Nifty 50 Index. While the rally was initially driven by a global rebound in tech stocks, the Federal Reserve’s dovish pivot at the December policy meeting turbocharged the run.
Agencies
Brokerage firms including Citigroup Inc. and Jefferies Financial Group Inc. are now sounding caution on the sector’s outperformance, citing rich valuations and tepid growth prospects.

The Nifty IT gauge trades at 26.4 times its one-year forward earnings, a 31% premium to the benchmark Nifty and sharply above the five-year mean, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

“We remain cautious given risks to growth on back of macro headwinds and pace of margin improvement versus expectations,” Citigroup analysts Surendra Goyal and Rajiv Berlia wrote in a note Tuesday. “Valuations are at risk.”

Analysts expect flat-to-low single-digit growth in revenue for the top software firms in the three-month period ended December due to the reduced discretionary spending by clients and higher-than-expected furloughs in the quarter.

The shift in focus among clients toward paring costs from making fresh investments “do not inspire confidence,” Kotak Securities said in a Dec. 29 note. Citigroup initiated negative catalyst watch on as many as four software exporters, including Wipro, citing possible earnings risk, while ICICI Securities downgraded five stocks in its coverage ahead of the earnings season that kicks off on January 11.

The rally’s sustenance now hinges on the outlook Indian software exporters provide on demand for their services and if the boom in generative artificial intelligence proves to be a catalyst for growth in 2024, analysts said."

With feminine hygiene penetration lower than 30% in India, a host of companies have entered the segment historically dominated by P&G and J&J. While they have a significant presence in India, the challenges are also equally massive in increasing market penetration due to limited awareness about feminine hygiene and low purchasing power of a significant portion of the Indian women populace. Factors such as poverty, cultural norms, and education levels affect the usage rates of these products. Despite their strong brand presence and extensive product lines, these incumbents cannot alone address the underlying socio-economic barriers that limit market growth, it said.

""A large portion of women still don’t have access to such products mainly due to factors including social stigma, lack of education and awareness about menstrual health, and the availability and affordability of hygiene products. We aim to increase this penetration by making these products more accessible and by raising awareness about the importance of feminine hygiene,"" said , founder and CEO of Pee Safe, adding that the company has doubled revenues over the past two years.

Originally launched a decade ago with just one product, a toilet seat sanitizer by Vikas Bagaria, and Srijana Bagaria (husband-wife duo) out of a personal incident, Pee Safe has evolved into a personal hygiene and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) brand. In the past six years, the company has diversified its product range to include personal hygiene categories, addressing the needs of girls from puberty to menopause. The portfolio has intimate hygiene products such as reusable pads, tampons, menstrual cups, and more.

The company said it is expanding its retail expansion in tier I and tier II cities, while going deeper into the cities where Pee Safe has existing brand equity, taking the current 15,000 network to 40,000 stores in 2024. It will also double down on select international markets, especially the UK, Middle East and subcontinent where it has seen success online.

""Lack of awareness and purchasing power impacts the penetration. Pee Safe has a clear growth target – to serve an additional 5 million customers. Having already reached 7.5 million customers since its inception, the company recognizes the need for an aggressive expansion to increase its market presence and to improve the accessibility of its products,"" he added.

The expansion would involve strategic placement in both urban and rural areas and engaging in partnerships or distribution agreements to reach a wider audience.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/why-have-onion-prices-crashed-in-the-past-three-weeks/articleshow/106482389.cms,"On December 8, the central government banned the export of onions till March 2024. This resulted in the onion prices crashing by more than 60% in less than three weeks.

While explaining the rationale for banning the exports, the government said that it had considered the delay in the kharif arrival, and the quantity of onion exported.

The quantity of onion exported remained strong right from July onward not just because there was a global shortage of onions and the demand from the next-door neighbour Bangladesh was very high but also because of Indian export policies gone wrong.

When the retail onion prices had imposed an of 40% on August 19 without fixing a floor price on which to impose the duty, this loophole was exploited by traders who resorted to under-invoicing to pay lower duties and the export continued in large volumes due to high global demand for .

After repeated requests from a section of trade, the government introduced a minimum export price (MEP) of $ 800/tonne on October 28, 2023. However, it removed the 40% export duty. Exporters could do over invoicing as they did not have to pay any tax. Thus, onion exports continued to be robust, as was predicted by trade veterans and reported by ET. In fact, exports got a boost after kharif onion started arriving in the markets. According to trade experts, India needed to have both the MEP as well as the export duty to be in place simultaneously to keep the exports open yet to control the export volumes.

Continued high export volumes from India's stored crop, coupled with lower and delayed production of the fresh kept onion prices high till the first week of November.
The second reason given by the government for the was delay in the arrival of the kharif crop. However, the government failed to notice the daily growing arrivals of kharif onions. At the Lasalgaon APMC in Maharashtra, the daily arrival of kharif onion had increased from about 9,000 quitals per day in the first few days of December to 15,000 quitnals on December 6 and 18,000 quintals on December 7. The exports were banned on December 8. The daily arrival of kharif onion has since increased to around 30,000 quitnals per day.
The kharif onion is now expected to flood the domestic markets. Arrivals of kharif onion are in full swing in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which has reduced the dependence of the country on Maharashtra for onions. December to February is the crucial period for Indian onion exports. Exports help the excess onion crop to get an outlet out of the country. As the kharif crop has no shelf life, farmers bring it to markets immediately after harvest.

With arrivals of onion leapfrogging every day, exports banned, and domestic demand reduced, the prices had to crash. The minimum prices, which did not go below Rs 20/kg till last month, have crashed to Rs 2-6/kg at many mandis in Maharashtra."

The flower-bedecked temple town, associated with the Ramayana for centuries and at the centrestage of modern day politics since the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, was the cynosure of attention as Modi said the strength of 'vikas' (development) and 'virasat' (heritage) would take India forward.

""The whole world is waiting for the historic moment of the 'pran pratishtha' ceremony in Ayodhya on January 22,"" Modi said at a rally here while appealing to people to not come on the day itself.

Stressing that the business of people from across the country and the world coming to Ayodhya had started and would go on till eternity, the prime minister also appealed for a resolve to make town the cleanest in the country.

Addressing the meeting after inaugurating the Maharshi Valmiki airport and the redeveloped station named Ayodhya Dham from where he flagged off two Amrit Bharat and six Vande Bharat trains, some virtually, he appealed to all citizens to light diyas in their houses on January 22 so the whole country basks in the glory of the temple.

Marking January 22 as a special day, he also asked people to launch cleanliness drives at pilgrimage sites and temples across the country from Makar Sankranti on January 14 till the temple consecration day.

There was a time Lord Ram was ""living under a tent"", but now he will get a concrete house like the four crore poor who got pucca houses, he said.

The Ujjwala scheme, he said, had transformed the lives of crores of mothers and sisters. Only 14 crore gas connections were given in five decades, but his government in a decade gave 18 crore, including 10 crore free of cost under the scheme, the prime minister pointed out.

Modi inaugurated, dedicated to the nation and laid the foundation stone of multiple development projects worth more than Rs 15,700 crore.

These comprise projects worth about Rs 11,100 crore for the development of the city and its surrounding areas, and those worth about Rs 4,600 crore related to other works in Uttar Pradesh.

The day in Ayodhya, which in 1992 catapulted to global headlines with the demolition of the Mughal-era Babri Masjid by a group of kar sevaks who believed it was built on the birthplace of Lord Ram, was one of dances, music and the many folk colours of Uttar Pradesh and other states.

After he arrived in Ayodhya, Modi held a roadshow from the airport to the railway station and was greeted by hundreds of people lining alongside the route.

Modi greeted people from his car and at one point opened the door of his vehicle to wave back at them. People showered flower petals, waved BJP flags and raised slogans in his praise.

The prime minister also witnessed performances by cultural troupes along the route. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's office on Friday said that more than 1,400 performers would present folk art and cultural programmes on 40 stages along the route from the airport to the railway station.

While one group of women from Rajasthan danced the 'Chakri' to lilting tunes, another from Prayagraj performed the ancient folk dance 'Dedhiya'.

""It is believed that women of Prayagraj danced the 'Dedhiya' when Ramji and others had returned from Lanka after Lanka Dahan. Now, Ram Lalla is also getting a new temple, so the divine feeling have come back, so this performance. As also to welcome the PM,"" lead dancer Preeti Singh told PTI.

The inauguration of the airport and railway station took place after the roadshow.

After inaugurating the station, the prime minister took a tour of the facility. He was accompanied by Adityanath, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and others. Modi was briefed by Vaishnaw about the station, the facade of which is inspired by traditional temple architecture.

The Phase-I of the redeveloped station -- Ayodhya Dham Junction Railway Station -- has been completed at a cost of more than Rs 240 crore, officials said.

The three-storey railway station building is equipped with features such as lifts, escalators, food plazas, shops for puja needs, cloak rooms, child care rooms and waiting halls.

The station building is ""accessible for all"" and an ""IGBC certified green station building"", according to officials

The prime minister visited the Lata Mangeshkar Chowk, where a giant-size veena has been installed. In keeping with the place and the mood, a bhajan by the late music queen played in the backdrop.

During the inauguration of the airport, Union Minister for Civil Aviation Jyotiraditya Scindia, Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Gen (Retired) VK Singh and Adityanath were among those who accompanied Modi.

The facade of the terminal building depicts the architecture of the upcoming Ram temple here, while its interiors are decorated with paintings and murals depicting the life of Lord Ram.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/suspended-sri-lanka-cricket-to-introduce-new-law-to-curb-political-interference/articleshow/106482302.cms,"Suspended by the ICC for ""political interference"", Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) will soon introduce a new law to curb meddling of any sorts by people with considerable influence in the corridors of power. A cabinet sub-committee appointed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe last November reported back to him on Monday with the necessary recommendations.

The sub-committee was appointed after the then Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe moved to form an interim panel to run SLC in a blatant violation of the ICC's governance rules for member nations.

The ICC promptly suspended SLC, leading to shifting of the Under-19 World Cup this month to South Africa.

Wickremesinghe sacked Ranasinghe and his successor, Harin Fernando, and later overturned the interim committee, leaving the elected administration of Shammi Silva intact.

During the crisis Wickremesinghe said he would draft a new sports law which would replace the 1973 law that had given powers to the sports minister to appoint interim committees.

Foreign Minister Ali Sabry, who headed the cabinet committee, said they had reviewed the current composition and structure of SLC to propose reforms.

The beleaguered sports body that acquired a prominent place since the country's triumph in the 1996 World Cup has seen many administrators scrambling for high positions, leading to the formation of several interim committees through political interference while violating the ICC rules.

It is often alleged that the current voting structure for office bearers facilitates vote buying.

The committee had probed the reasons behind Sri Lanka's poor position in international rankings currently and had identified ways to revamp the game at school, district and provincial levels, a release said.

The agency had filed two FIRs in May 2022 against seven people after receiving information that ""a network of individuals involved in cricket betting are influencing the outcome of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches based on inputs received from Pakistan"".

The CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) named Dileep Kumar, based in Delhi's Rohini, and Gurram Vasu and Gurram Satish -- based in Hyderabad -- as accused in its first FIR. Sajjan Singh, Prabhu Lal Meena, Ram Avtar and Amit Kumar Sharma, all from Rajasthan, were named as accused in the second FIR.

After nearly two years of probe, the CBI could not find enough evidence to proceed with the prosecution against them.

The agency filed a closure report in a special court on December 23, in which it has given detailed description of the allegations and its probe in the matter, besides citing reasons for recommending the closure of the case, officials said.

It will now be up to the court to decide whether to accept the report filed by the agency or order it to continue further investigations, they said.

The agency had booked these people on allegations that they were running the racket for more than 10-13 years with suspicious cash transactions being made from their accounts, the officials said.

The CBI had alleged that these individuals were in touch with Pakistani individuals through a Pakistani mobile number.

The two networks getting inputs from Pakistan were allegedly deceiving the public by ""inducing them for betting"", the FIR had said.

The FIR had alleged that the racketeers had bank accounts (mule accounts) using fake identities and know your customer (KYC) documents, in connivance with unidentified bank officials.

The CBI alleged that Dileep Kumar was operating a number of bank accounts in which domestic cash deposits worth more than Rs 43 lakh had been made since 2013, defying ""economic rationale"", the officials said.

The central agency had also alleged that in the six bank accounts operated by Gurram Satish, cash deposits worth Rs 4.55 crore (domestic) and Rs 3.05 lakh (foreign) were made during 2012-20. In the case of Gurram Vasu, the amount was Rs 5.37 crore during the same period.

The agency had alleged that there was no recognisable business rationale to explain the transactions.

""The information reveals that this network of individuals was involved in cricket betting during Indian Premier League (IPL) matches held in the year 2019,"" the FIR related to Delhi-Hyderabad racket alleged.

""The persons involved are running the racket of cricket betting, committing fraud by inducing betting by the general public and thereby deceiving the public of their hard-earned money and also indulging in impersonating their identities in operating various bank accounts,"" it stated.

""The information reveals that this network of individuals was involved in cricket betting during the then-ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) matches held in the year 2019 in Delhi and other places,"" the FIR had alleged.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is slated to inaugurate the Shri Ram International Airport and the redeveloped Ayodhya railway station on December 30.

On Thursday evening, a PTI team visited the airport when workers were rushing to complete civil work, and the terminal building was being decorated with tricolour-theme fabric.

While the core of the newly built airport, located about 15 km from the main Ayodhya city, uses modern construction material, the facade of the terminal has been lent a traditional look as done in the new building of the Ayodhya station.

Even the main gateway has been built in a similar way, carrying a concrete core and cladding of sandstone bearing stylised carvings.

The main road that leads from Sitapur Road side to the airport has been decked up with several posters carrying images of Prime Minister Modi, and a welcome message.

Ornamental lamp posts have been installed on this route while greenery on the median adds to the aesthetic look of the area.

Huge welcoming posters with images of Modi and describing Ayodhya as a holy city have also been put up on the Ayodhya Bypass while many houses along that road now carry on their rooftops saffron flags with images of Lord Ram or Lord Hanuman and the chant 'Jai Shri Ram'.

The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on Thursday issued a statement saying Prime Minister Modi will visit Ayodhya on December 30.

At around 11:15 am, the prime minister will inaugurate the redeveloped Ayodhya railway station and flag off new Amrit Bharat trains and Vande Bharat trains, it said, adding he will also dedicate several other railway projects to the nation.

At around 12:15 pm, the prime minister will inaugurate the Ayodhya airport, the PMO said.

The prime minister will later participate in a public programme where he will inaugurate, delicate to nation and lay the foundation stone of multiple development projects worth more than Rs 15,700 crore in the state, the statement said.

""The phase 1 of the state-of-the-art airport has been developed at a cost of more than Rs 1,450 crore. The airport's terminal building will have an area of 6,500 sqm, equipped to serve about 10 lakh passengers annually,"" it said.

The facade of the terminal building ""depicts the temple architecture of the upcoming Shri Ram Mandir of Ayodhya"", the statement said.

The interiors of the terminal building have been decorated with local art, paintings and murals depicting the life of Lord Ram.

The Ayodhya airport has an extended runway suitable for A-321/B-737 type aircraft operations.

Airliner IndiGo earlier this month had said that it would operate the inaugural flight from the national capital to Ayodhya airport on December 30 and the commercial services will commence from January 6.

This will be followed by tri-weekly flights between Ahmedabad and Ayodhya from January 11, it had said.

Ayodhya native Ayushi Kasaudhan, an engineering student pursuing BTech from a college in Noida, said this will help her reach home faster during holidays.

""This airport was much-needed as trains run late at times. I generally take Ayodhya Express or Kaifiyat Express from Delhi, and it takes about 15 hours by train. So, I am eagerly waiting to see it open for passengers,"" she told PTI here.

Kasaudhan on Thursday evening had travelled, along with some family members, from Ayodhya to just see the new airport.

Many other residents are also excited about its inauguration.

The office of Union Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on Thursday posted on X a teaser video on the airport's inauguration.

""Just as the construction work of Ram temple in Ayodhya is at its peak, similarly the construction of Ayodhya airport is also in its final stages to welcome the devotees, which will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji on 30 December 2023.

""This state-of-the-art airport, decorated with themes from the epic Ramayana, will take the development of pilgrimage and tourism in the entire region to new heights,"" the post said.

Prime Minister Modi's visit will come just ahead of 'pran pratishtha' (consecration) of the under-construction Ram temple in Ayodhya.

A grand Ram temple is currently under construction in Ayodhya, with the consecration ceremony to be held on January 22, which will be attended by the prime minister.

Large posters bearing a symbolic image of the upcoming Ram temple, design of the new airport along with a message that hails Ayodhya as a city of ""Maryada, Dharm and Sanskriti"" have been put up in the temple town, including at locations near the airport and the station and the bypass road.

The terminal building of Ayodhya airport is also equipped with various sustainability features like insulated roofing system, LED lighting, rain water harvesting, landscaping with fountains, water treatment plant, sewage treatment plant, and solar power plant to meet GRIHA - 5 star ratings, the PMO said in its statement.

The airport will improve connectivity in the region, leading to a boost in tourism, business activities and employment opportunities, it added.

""We deeply regret the incidents that happened this year and needless to say, we strive and work round-the-clock to minimize the probability of such incidents. However, it is impossible for any technology-first business, especially ones that are time-sensitive and to have to cater to a large number of users, to never have incidents,"" Kamath wrote in a blog post.

To minimize the impact of any potential issues, he said they have made significant architectural changes over the years.

""This is one of the reasons why any incidents that happen affect a small % of users. But, given the demographics of our customers, we tend to get disproportionately large social media attention and press coverage. The exchange data however indicates that we have the least complaints among the top brokers as a percentage of our active customers at the exchanges. All that said, minimizing the probability of any issues is always at the absolute top of our list of priorities,"" the billionaire broker said.

In 2023 alone, Zerodha admitted to at least eight technical glitches with issues varying from those relating to login on the Kite app, display of orders and positions as well as order placements.

Kamath also gave an update on products that India's second-largest stock broker has in the pipeline - Realtime Nudges, New portfolio visualisations, Instant fund withdrawals, Nudge Assist, and Trade from Option Chain.

During the year 2023, Zerodha also launched operations of its mutual fund business with Zerodha Nifty LargeMidcap 250 Index fund and Zerodha ELSS Nifty LargeMidcap 250 Index fund.

The brokerage also quietly started lending operations in 2023 with its NBFC arm Zerodha Capital.

""We started Zerodha Capital, our NBFC business, in 2020 with the aim of helping our users build a strong credit profile and also give people access to lower interest rate loans that could perhaps help pay off costlier loans. However, Zerodha Capital has been in capacity-building mode until very recently. We only really started lending operations in 2023 and are currently at a book size of Rs 112 crore,"" Kamath said.

Zerodha has expanded the list of securities eligible for pledging to avail of loan from Zerodha Capital to include 653 securities across stocks and mutual funds.

Talking of earnings, how are the valuations looking both on the benchmark indices front and also on the broader market front because there are two sections, one says valuations are starting to get frothy; the other says no, earnings support is there, so valuations are still fair.
Dr Joseph Thomas: Yes, valuations do not look cheap, which does not mean that they are too expensive also, but we could term the valuations may be reasonable in a sense, which means that the current valuations and the pricing is or the valuations is based on certain strong fundamentals like robust economic growth that has been happening in the economy, the rate of economic growth is very good compared to even other economies and it is expected to keep up that momentum.

The second thing is that the capex, especially the government capex and the compounded annual growth of government capex in the last seven-eight years has been around 12%.

The third factor which gives a lot of support to the markets is the probability of a soft money policy coming from the Reserve Bank of India in the coming days, which means that the interest rate cycle of rate hikes is past us and we might see soft money policy coming in, maybe it might take maybe one quarter, maybe two quarters, but it is going to come in.

We are seeing very strong momentum in smallcap space; froth can continue over short to medium term: Ashi Anand

We are seeing a very strong investment cycle at this point of time. The PLI scheme, which the government has introduced, has also helped enhance capacity or introduce new capacity and this enhancement and introduction of new capacity, all these things have gone into determining the demand for stocks in the markets and also FII flows have been coming in. So, overall, there is a robustness about the investment cycle, the overall economy, the liquidity conditions and the interest rate scenario.

All these things have helped the markets to move up at this point of time to the levels that we are seeing at this time. And coming to the relative valuations, largecaps look much better at this point of time. Largecaps, mainly because, for example, in the last one year, if we take the 12 months trailing, the largecaps’ long-term average is at 24 and the valuations are somewhere close to that, which means that the largecap segment is fairly priced and they make immense investment sense.

When we go to midcaps and the smallcaps, if you look at the 12 months trailing PE, the smallcaps are at around 27.5 and the midcaps are at around 26 which means that they have a bit of a stretched valuation. This is also mainly because of one factor that we have seen in the markets that there is a lot of moneys flowing into midcap stocks and smallcap stocks mainly through the mutual fund and these mutual fund moneys which have been coming into the markets have led to demand for these stocks and they have moved up which means that even in portfolios which have invested into largecaps, midcaps and smallcaps, there is a distortion that is happening at this point of time because of the rising value of smallcaps and midcaps.

The largecap composition probably may be relatively smaller. Therefore, at this point of time, one could be looking at the largecap segment more rather than the midcaps and the smallcaps and midcap and smallcap investments could continue but it is the largecap segment which should be looked at more closely at this point of time.

You are bullish on the pharma space. What kind of names are you most bullish on, given that pharma is getting re-rated today and an almost all-round move is coming in the second upgrade on Lupin in recent times?
Dr Joseph Thomas: In pharma, even in Emkay’s portfolio and research, the names which have come up for a long time have been Divi’s Labs and Laurus Labs and also Dr Reddy's. So, overall, because pharma after a very good run during the Covid and then it was a bit sold off, now it is on its way to come back and we expect these stocks to do very well and the pharma segment to do much better.

The other space I want to talk to you about is the metals pack. One section of the market believes that the dollar index coming down is actually hugely beneficial for metal packs. The other side believes that a weak US and China will continue to be an issue for the metal sector. Which camp are you in?
Dr Joseph Thomas: As far as metals are concerned, most of the metal prices are quartered in terms of US dollars. So, the fundamental thing there is that if the US dollar starts depreciating and if the US dollar weakens, all those commodities which are in US dollars, which almost all commodities are including the precious metals, gold, silver or even oil, are likely to edge higher. But we need to get a clear signal on that, that the US dollar is likely to start declining.

At this point of time, we see the dollar index has been at around 101.50 to 102.50 levels. It touched 104 briefly. But in the immediate term, it is expected to move towards 99.91, 100.20 levels. But we will see a decline in the dollar index as the clear indications on the US interest rate trajectory comes to the surface, that at this point of time it is almost clear that US official policy on interest rates would be one of hold at this point of time and Fed could go in for a cut in interest rates also.

The dollar has been able to hold well, mainly because of the rising interest rates in the US and therefore the dollar index also rallied. Once the dollar starts declining, the metal prices could gradually move up, that is a strong reason for metal prices to move up. But there are other countervailing factors also.

Pharma, two-wheelers, IT services space should do much better in 2024: Gaurav Dua

For example, China has been a major buyer of commodities, especially metals and as of now even based on Xi's address to the nation the other day, China probably is shifting a little bit because economically they have been quite depressed at this point of time with growth at sub-5% levels. It is highly likely that China could shift its focus to artificial intelligence and more tech driven and more internal driven growth.

Therefore, the Chinese demand coming into the markets or not, the US dollar declining or US dollar rising or not, these are two factors which would be critical and I think it will be a prudent assumption to make that with decline in the US dollars, which could happen over the next one or two quarters systematically, the commodity prices could also move up."

Concerns about a potential fuel shortage emerged as drivers expressed their discontent with a provision in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, replacing the colonial-era Indian Penal Code. Under this new law, drivers causing a serious road accident due to negligent driving, and subsequently fleeing without informing authorities, could face severe penalties, including up to 10 years of imprisonment or a fine of Rs 7 lakh.

""Petrol pumps started getting dry yesterday. If we don't get the supply, most of the pumps will run out of fuel from today."" Mumbai, with around 200 petrol pumps, faced disruptions as oil marketing companies' depots in Sewri were blocked by protesting drivers, impeding the movement of fuel tankers,"" Chetan Modi, president of the Petrol Dealers Association in Mumbai, told PTI.

Anil Garg, president of the School Bus Association, noted the long queues at fuel pumps and attributed the agitation to spontaneous actions by some drivers fueled through social media messages. However, no official declaration of a strike by any truckers' body has been made.

In Nagpur, panic buying ensued as truck drivers' protests led to queues at petrol pumps since Monday night. Nagpur Collector Dr Vipin Itankar reassured the public of sufficient stock of petrol, diesel, and LPG, urging them not to succumb to rumors and avoid unnecessary crowding at petrol pumps.

Local transportation in Nagpur was impacted due to a 'chakka jam' by truck drivers, as claimed by a local Shiv Sena (UBT) functionary supporting the agitation. Various truck driver associations planned to stage protests and discuss the future course of action in response to the contentious provision in the new penal law.

The Maharashtra Food, Civil Supply and Consumer Protection Department, on Monday, requested police intervention to ensure the smooth and uninterrupted supply of petrol, diesel, and LPG cylinders. The department also sought appropriate action under the Essential Commodities Act against drivers and transporters causing interruptions in the supply of petroleum products.

In Tuesday’s trading session, the following five stocks witnessed a build of fresh long positions. Lets first understand how this conclusion is reached that whether the stock has seen a buildup of fresh long position or not. When the stock prices move up and open interest on the counter also moves upward, it is taken as a sign of a long buildup. The signal is considered more reliable if the volume on the counter has also seen an increase.

NMDC topped the list, the stock price gained 3.53%, and open interest saw a rise of 2.14%. BHEL's stock price surged 2.88%, and open interest saw an increase of 4.99%.

stock rose 2.69%, and the open interest saw an increase of 5.19%. price jumped 2.23% and open interest saw an increase of 0.99%. stock price gained 2.21% and open interest saw an increase of 1.97%.

Some additional checks would help traders in taking better trading decisions as they increase the probability of a follow-up of the upward movement in the stock price. First, if this fresh long build has come when the stock is very close to its 52-week high, that increases the probability of the stock making an attempt to break its previous 52-week high.

Second, if this long buildup is accompanied by any bullish crossover, which means that in the current up move when the open interest has moved up the stock price has been able to cross either its 20, 50 or 100-day moving average.

Another couple of points which traders should keep in mind when taking a trade is to look at the matrix of buildup of long positions on the basis of open interest.

If that is broken, then a slightly deeper correction till 21,300 could be seen. But yes, the trend remains up. At lower levels, there will be some buying emerging over there. We feel that the Nifty is likely to head towards say 22,000-22,300 levels in a couple of months’ time.”

Are you seeing this drawdown or the fall in the Nifty as a temporary move or expecting Nifty to consolidate at these levels going forward for some time at least?
Mileen Vasudeo: Coming to Nifty, yes, we could see some kind of a time-wise correction or a minor correction towards 21,500 levels. But going forward, 21,500, which is the 10-day moving average line, is a very key support level. If that is broken, then a slightly deeper correction till 21,300 could be seen. But yes, the trend remains up.

And at lower levels, there will be some buying emerging over there. But we are working out with the higher targets of Nifty. We feel that Nifty is likely to head towards say 22,000-22,300 levels in a couple of months’ time. One has to trade with positive bias only in this because one should adopt a buy on decline strategy going forward.

Nifty Pharma is a top sectoral gainer. Now, there are various fundamental reasons why this index has been gaining. How are you looking at Nifty Pharma in the chart?
Mileen Vasudeo: Nifty Pharma clearly had given a breakout and now it is outperforming the benchmark indices. There are a lot of stocks in the pharma pack, which are showing strength and which have the potential to even rise for nearly 20 to 40% from current levels also.

Anything specific that you would look at in the Nifty Pharma space as of now, anything that you are finding attractive in specific stock names?
Mileen Vasudeo: I am recommending two stocks here. One is Zydus Life which last time I had seen at Rs 730. Keep a stop loss of Rs 685, target would be Rs 769-797 levels.

The second stock is by Divi’s Lab, currently trading at Rs 5,922. The weekly charts of Divi’s Lab shows an inverse head and shoulder pattern and the targets are much higher than what I am giving just now. One can keep a stop loss of Rs 5,800 on the higher side. Yes, Rs 6,114-6,240 could be possible.

Could you just pull up the charts for BHEL? Obviously, there has been some news flow and reports and clarifications also that came in from BHEL. But the stock has been gaining in trade. Today also, it is up almost 2.5%. On the charts, BHEL, how is it looking? Is there any attractive pattern that has been formed there?
Mileen Vasudeo: Clearly eight days of consolidation was broken at 187 levels. Now, those who are holding this stock can keep a stop loss at somewhere around Rs 180 on the higher side. Yes, this stock can test the levels of Rs 220-240 levels in a couple of weeks' time.

Let us talk about one other sector, Nifty IT., IT results will be announced starting next week. But as a move for the sector or any mid or small cap IT company that you would look at or do you expect it to see a turnaround now finally coming in?
Mileen Vasudeo: Earlier, we gave a call on Lemon Tree at Rs 126 levels. It has given a rounding base breakout on the weekly chart and the volumes are substantially higher in this counter. This shows that this stock has got a potential to go on the higher side. One can keep a stop loss of Rs 121. On the higher side, you could expect Rs 146-154 to an outer extent of Rs 163 levels.

Any IT companies that you would find attractive to enter right now?
Mileen Vasudeo: TCS is the one which we are recommending in IT and currently it is consolidating at current levels. That is, it is trading at Rs 3,779 level. One can initiate a long in TCS also. On the higher side, it could test the levels of Rs 3,900-4,000 levels. So, one should trade with positive bias in TCS also.

But how are you looking at the Nifty Auto Index for 2024? And after four straight calendar years of gain, are you expecting even 2024 to be an outstanding year for the Nifty Auto Index?
Mileen Vasudeo: Currently it is quite extended and I am of the opinion that some consolidation could happen at current levels. But definitely at lower levels, there could be some buying at lower levels. And yes, Auto Index is also one thing which is outperforming the benchmark indices and one can look in Auto Index at lower levels.

Any specific stock ideas from the auto space?
Mileen Vasudeo: TVS motor is one which we are recommending continuously. No doubt it is overstretched at present. But definitely if it comes down to the levels of say 1900 or 1950-1900 levels, one can initiate a long in it. On the higher side, we are working with the targets of 2200 levels.

Despite the underperformance that we are seeing in the markets today PSUs continue to outperform the benchmark. How are you looking at PSU as a basket for 2024?
Mileen Vasudeo: The PSU index for the last six months is showing some kind of a strength and there are a lot of stocks like Bank of Baroda, SBI, then Canara Bank, that are showing strong patterns. And from the current level also, I expect nearly 10% to 15% move in these stocks."

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/et-explains/et-explainer-how-to-make-a-dormant-bank-account-regular/articleshow/106480284.cms,"The Reserve Bank of India came out with an updated set of rules for inoperative accounts. Here's an explainer of the concept and how to avoid getting penalised.

When does a bank account become inoperative or dormant?
A savings as well as current account is treated as inoperative or dormant if there are no customer-induced financial or non-financial transactions in the account for over a period of two years. Changing transaction limit, requesting for issue of cheque book or credit card and debit card and making a balance enquiry are non-financial transactions.


If there is no transaction in an account for a year, banks will inform the account holder through letters or email or SMS about it. The alert message would invariably mention that the account would turn ‘inoperative’ if no operations are done during the next one year. If the account holder still fails to comply within the extended period, banks would classify the said account as inoperative.


When a bank account turns inoperative, the account holder cannot make any financial or non-financial transaction in the account. The balance amount in the said account will however reman safe and keep earning interest on regular intervals.


The Reserve Bank of India has made the process of regularising a dormant account simple. An account can be made operative merely submitting a fresh set of documents for customer identification. In case of joint holding, documents including photograph, PAN, proof of address and proof of identity need to be submitted for both the account holders. The bank will intimate customers though SMS and registered email stating that on the basis of the know your customer (KYC) documents submitted by them, the inoperative status of the account has been removed.


No charges will be levied for activation of inoperative accounts. Banks are also not permitted to levy penal charges for non-maintenance of minimum balances in any account that is classified as an .

To be sure, banks are liable to credit interest on savings accounts on a regular basis irrespective of the fact that the account is in operation or not.


The credit balance in any deposit account maintained with banks, which have not been operated upon for ten years or more, or any amount remaining unclaimed for ten years or more is called unclaimed deposits. After 10 years, banks transfer the money to Depositor Education & Awareness (DEA) Fund maintained by .


No. Separate forms are available at bank branches for recovering unclaimed deposits. There are prescribed procedure for such claim by a depositor or his/her nominee / legal heir in case of death of the said depositor. Banks maintains a list of inoperative accounts and unclaimed deposits.


To keep the account active and avoid hassles, account holders must carry out some transaction -- financial or non-financial -- in the account on regular intervals, at least once in a year. A savings account is treated as operative, if interest on fixed deposits is credited to this account, which otherwise not used for transactions."

The strict action initiated by the regulator has prompted more than 222 projects or 46.25% out of 480 projects registered in the month of April 2023 to file their quarterly updates within the stipulated time limit.

Notably, only two out of 746 projects or 0.02% projects registered in January 2023, around 19% or 131 out of 700 projects registered in February and around 34% or 150 out of 440 projects registered in March had provided quarterly updates before issuing any notice.

“As per the regulatory provisions Quarterly Progress Report (QPR) of housing projects is mandatory to be submitted to MahaRERA and updated on the website. This helps the homebuyers to know the current and correct status of the project. The 46.25% response of projects in March compared to January's 0.02% is certainly comforting. But MahaRERA is aiming for 100% response and insists on that,” said Ajoy Mehta, Chairman, MahaRERA.

In September, the regulator had suspended the registration of over three 388 projects of real estate developers for not complying with the mandatory update of information related to their projects on quarterly basis.

This information is required to be updated as per the Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act, 2016. The regulation states that realty developers must register their projects with MahaRERA and update the information related to the same on a quarterly basis.

This is aimed at helping homebuyers know progress of the project such as how many units are sold; how much money was collected and the expenditure incurred and to understand whether the expenditure incurred is commensurate with the physical progress.

MahaRERA has started taking stringent actions against projects and total 741 projects are held in abeyance till date and 195 out of them further complied and withdrawal orders were issued. Currently around 546 projects are held in abeyance and their bank accounts have been frozen."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/budget-2024-who-will-present-interim-budget-2024-and-how-is-it-prepared/articleshow/106227671.cms,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present her sixth consecutive budget since 2019, placing her in an exclusive category of finance ministers who have delivered at least five consecutive Union Budgets. This distinguished group includes notable figures such as Morarji Desai, Manmohan Singh, P Chidambaram, Yashwant Sinha, and Arun Jaitley.

It is slated to be an interim budget since the Lok Sabha elections are scheduled for early next year.

The budget-making process usually begins in September, over six months before the date of presentation. Making a budget is a time-taking process that entails numerous steps and consultations.

Have you ever pondered the intricate process of crafting the budget? Comprising a multitude of financial proposals, its creation is no small undertaking. Similar to the adage that Rome wasn't built in a day, the Union Budget of India doesn't come to fruition in a matter of days. Rather, it involves extensive months of meticulous planning, consultations, and compilation efforts to culminate in the final draft. Let's delve into the collaborative endeavors of various branches of the Government dedicated to shaping the Union Budget.

Issue of circular
Budget is a collaborative effort involving various government entities, with the Budget Division of the Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance spearheading the process. It entails the issuance of budget-related circulars by the Finance Ministry to a range of entities, including States and Union Territories, Union Ministries, Defence forces, Government departments, and Autonomous bodies asking them to prepare estimates for the coming year.

These entities play a crucial role in the budgetary process by preparing financial estimates for their upcoming year's spending and revenue, along with providing revised estimates from the previous year. In addition to offering projections, the ministries also present comprehensive information on their earnings and expenditures from the previous year.

A comprehensive review
After the revenue secretary receives the proposals, government officials at the highest levels conduct a comprehensive review. The Department of Expenditures and various ministries engage in extensive consultations to meticulously scrutinize all facets of the proposals. After approval of the data, it is forwarded to the finance ministry.

The finance ministry conducts a thorough analysis of data, comparing revenue and expenditure estimates to ascertain the comprehensive budget deficit. Subsequently, the government engages with the Chief Economic Advisor to determine the most suitable level of borrowing necessary to address the deficit.

Distribution of revenue
After reviewing all suggestions, the finance ministry makes decisions regarding the distribution of revenue to different departments for their forthcoming expenditures. In case of any disputes regarding fund allocation, the finance ministry seeks input from the Union Cabinet or the Prime Minister before moving forward.

Pre-Budget discussions
Following the allocation of funds, the finance minister engages in pre-budget discussions with diverse stakeholders to gain insights into their proposals and requirements. These stakeholders encompass state representatives, bankers, agriculturists, economists, and trade unions. This year pre-budget consultations with ministries started on October 10 and continued till November 14, as per scheduled prepared by the ministry.

After concluding pre-budget discussions, the finance minister, following extensive consultations with the Prime Minister, makes the ultimate decision on the demands of various stakeholders.

'Halwa' ceremony
To mark the concluding phase of the Union Budget formulation, the government observes the annual tradition of 'halwa' ceremony. This event signifies the start of the printing of Budget documents, with the entire staff at the finance ministry partaking in the distribution of 'halwa.'

To ensure the confidentiality of the Budget details, there is a period of seclusion for the officials engaged in the Budget-making process. The Budget Press, located within North Block, serves as the residence for these officers and staff during the period leading up to the presentation of the Union Budget. They come out from North Block only after the Union Finance Minister has officially presented the budget.

Final move
The final step in the budgetary process involves the introduction of the budget to Parliament. The finance minister delivers a comprehensive presentation on the first day of the Budget session. This presentation entails a condensed overview of crucial elements within the budget and provides insights into the rationale behind the proposed recommendations.

After the presentation, the budget undergoes scrutiny and debate in both houses of Parliament. Once it secures approval from both chambers, the budget is forwarded to the President for official endorsement.

Before 2016, it was traditionally presented on the last day of February. However, starting in 2017, the budget has been consistently presented on February 1 each year.

A notable shift occurred with the Union Budget 2021 when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced a paperless format for the first time. Departing from the traditional Swadeshi 'bahi khata,' she embraced modern technology by delivering the budget using a tablet.

News outlet BusinessWorld on December 29 reported that Musk was in talks to tie up with billionaire businessman Musk's Starlink during Vibrant Gujarat summit due to take place on January 10. The report claimed Vodafone Idea could be among the suitors as Starlink looks to enter the Indian market.

The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on Monday asked the company for a clarification regarding the same.

""In this regard, we would like to submit that the Company is not in any such discussion with the named party. We are not aware of the basis of the said news item,"" said Vodafone Idea in its statement.

The shares of Vodafone Idea nosedived following the clarification, trading with losses of 5 per cent as of 13:30.

ET in July 2023 had reported that Starlink applied to the Indian National Space Promotion & Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) to get clearances for setting up earth stations.

Starlink in 2022 was forced to return pre-booking money to consumers in the country after the DoT asked it to first seek regulatory approvals before taking any pre-orders for its services. The company then withdrew its communication for pre-orders and has since been applied to get the requisite regulatory approvals.

Reports last week suggested that during Musk's January visit to Gujarat, announcement of the company setting up a factory in India could be made public.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/vodafone-idea-denies-market-talks-of-tie-up-with-elon-musks-starlink/articleshow/106480426.cms,"NEW DELHI: Debt-ridden telecom operator Vodafone Idea on Tuesday denied that it is in talks with Elon Musk's Starlink for a tie-up.

""We would like to submit that the Company is not in any such discussion with the named party,"" Vodafone Idea said in an exchange filing.

It was asked by stock exchange BSE to clarify on the news report saying that the stock went up on Friday on the market grapevine that Musk could tie-up with Vodafone Idea to enter India's telecom space.

""We are not aware of the basis of the said news item,"" the company said in response.

Since the last few months, there have been rumours in the market saying that the Indian government may sell its 33.1% stake in Vodafone Idea to Musk to enable Starlink to enter the Indian market.

Although the reports are unsubstantiated, if Vodafone Idea goes Starlink's way, then it would put three billionaires - Musk, Reliance Jio's Mukesh Ambani and Sunil Mittal of Bharti Airtel - in a face-to-face battle.

Punters got another opportunity last week to bet on Vodafone Idea shares after it was reported that the world's richest man is likely to fly down from America to attend the Vibrant Gujarat Business Summit between January 10 and 12 to announce the launch of Tesla's factory in India.

On the back of this news, the stock had rallied 21% last Friday and went up another 6% yesterday. Following today's clarification from the telco, its shares were trading over 4% lower. The stock has already doubled in the last six months.

In Q2, the company's consolidated net loss widened to Rs 8,738 crore while revenue from operations rose by a marginal 0.9% to Rs 10,716 crore. ARPU (average revenue per user) for the reporting quarter stood at Rs 142, compared with Rs 139 in the previous quarter, showing a sequential growth of 2.1%."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/agrochem-seeing-subdued-demand-battery-chemicals-in-focus-ajay-joshi/articleshow/106480049.cms,"Ajay Joshi, chemical industry expert, says “in solvent and commodity chemicals, Indian companies would continue to face pressure in terms of pricing, in terms of margins from Chinese chemical companies. The bright spot for the Indian chemical segment would be battery chemicals where the EV ecosystem is developing with newer investments from Tesla, VinFast who are going to set up EV plants in India.”

What are the big trends for the Indian chemical manufacturing sector for 12-18 months?
Ajay Joshi: Talking about the Indian chemical industry, this year agrochemicals will continue to deal with subdued demand. Right now, we are in the rabi crop season and already the wheat sowing is down 1%, oilseeds down 7% and pulses down 5%. Now, 30-35% of agrochemicals in India are consumed during the rabi season and already, we are facing a downturn.

Furthermore, the Latin American market, which is the number one export market for Indian agrochemical companies, is slowing. On the other side, in the US market also, there is an inventory slowdown. So, for agrochemicals, this year will remain similar to last year, also the next 8 to 10 months only towards the end of this calendar year we will see some recovery. Other segments of the Indian chemical industry will continue to face price and margin pressure from China. Just like you talked about that earlier, it used to be China plus one, now it is China 2.0, China's return.

Last calendar year, January to December 2023, 80 million metric tonnes of new chemical capacities including agrochemicals were added into China. Now, China is having the largest acetic acid capacity, 60% of global acetic acid capacities are in China. For terephthalic acid, they are now number one. From net importer in 2019, China in 2023 became net exporter of terephthalic acid.

In solvent and commodity chemicals, Indian companies would continue to face pressure in terms of pricing, in terms of margins from Chinese chemical companies. The bright spot for the Indian chemical segment would be battery chemicals where the EV ecosystem is developing with newer investments from Tesla, VinFast who are going to set up EV plants in India.

So, companies planning to enter or already entering the EV battery chemicals space whether it is graphite manufacturer, organometallic salt manufacturers, electrolyte manufacturers, or solvent manufacturers, will see very good outlet sales domestically. Overall, the weaker demand cycle whether it is domestic or global has not turned around yet. The pressure is going to remain from China.

But this quarter, specifically towards the first week of February, China will go for their lunar new year and we will see a slight increase in certain commodities like caustic soda, acetic acid, phenol, caprolactam, mono ethylene glycol. But again, once China resumes towards mid of February, the prices will again go back to the downward side.

But the Chinese lunar year is a regular annual event. Why will it have an impact this year?
Ajay Joshi: Yes. So, this year, the reason is that the demand already, domestic China demand is anyway weak, that is number one thing. Second, in India also, demand is very weak. China exports to Latin America are competing with Indian exporters. So, these are some of the reasons that this trend will take place.

One of the recent up and coming trends has been battery chemicals and that is one space that the Indian companies are looking at garnering more market share of. Which are companies you think have a right to win in this space?
Ajay Joshi: In battery chemicals, in the electrolyte and solvent space, which is the hot cake right now, Aether Industries, AMI Organics, Tatva Chintan, these are some of the companies. In fact, Aether Industries, they also happened to sign an MOU with the leading EV company for a multi-year supply contract of electrolyte.

Apart from that, AMI Organics, Tatva Chintan are also entering the electrolyte solvent space for battery chemicals.

Earlier in India, the demand outlets were not present, similar to China, but now with, like I said, EV companies investing into capacities in India, the demand outlets will open up. So, companies operating in this space will have a very-very demand turn. On the other side, for graphite manufacturers who would supply to the anode part of the batteries, companies like HimadriPhillips Carbon Black, they will also see very-very strong demand.

Agrochemicals sector has been a bit of a worry with respect to the excess inventory; demand has been a little bit subdued as well. Just want to know the road ahead in terms of some of these concerns, what it brings forth.
Ajay Joshi: For India, 55% to 60% of agrochemicals exports happen to the Latin American and US markets. The Latin American demand is very slow plus we are competing with a lot of Chinese suppliers there. In the US market on the other side, the days’ inventory outstanding value for agrochemicals at the stockist is around 70 to 80 days compared to the average of 45 to 50 days. Even the US market is facing a slowdown.

So, the orders will be pushed forward for a lot of Indian agrochemical exporters. On the other hand the capacity additions in China, particularly pyroxasulfone alone, the demand for this molecule is around 3800 metric tonnes. On the other hand, China added two new capacities, adding to 4000 metric tonnes per annum for pyroxasulfone alone. Similarly, new capacities have been added for 2,4-D, glucosinolates, metconazole, and so many other products. So, Indian players would continue to face fierce competition from the Chinese even in export markets, while the domestic demand is already slowing.

Why are punters & smart investors flocking to chemical stocks? What to avoid among bank stocks? Siddhartha Khemka explains

We are a financial channel. People want to hear and connect the dots here. If you are an investor, would you buy chemical stocks? If yes, which are the ones you will buy? Purely based on not the price, purely based on the earnings, where you think they are headed.
Ajay Joshi: Right now, some of the companies from the investor point of view we need to look forward to what is the order book plus what are the growth segments. Agrochemicals definitely is not a segment to enter into right now because for the next 8 to 12 months also there will not be any turnaround. But companies active in the speciality chemicals space and contract manufacturing space where we have visible order book, like Anupam Rasayan, Aarti Industries, Aether Industries, these are some of the companies where investors should look forward to in terms of buying.

Where do you think Europe will be because, the (9:08) BASFs and perhaps the bears of the world, they do have a huge advantage of manufacturing and technology because of their headquarters based out of Europe. Could that be a deciding factor for agrochemicals?
Ajay Joshi: For agrochemicals, in particular, if you look at the BASFs of the world, they already are doing asset transfer to China. Now, agrochemicals also will be carved out as a separate entity in India also. That means that in India also, (9:37) agrochemicals will have newer investment because it will have autonomy to operate. Europe will not play a major factor in 2024 because they already are struggling with higher production costs because of the Russia-Ukraine situation, so they are doing asset transfer to China. They are setting up big-scale plants in China. If I talk about (9:56) of the world, all the European majors. So, from Europe's side, even the domestic demand is also going to remain weak and the chemical output is also going to remain flattish.

Which is the other up-and-coming space that you would want to watch out for that, apart from the battery subset that we discussed, whether oleochemicals, whether the other subsets, what looks interesting as a theme now?
Ajay Joshi: Fluoropolymers. Companies like Anupam Rasayan, Navin Fluorine, GFL, these companies are going to have a party because Japan and Korea, they are looking at India only as a supply partner, not China because of their trade issues and other geopolitical issues. In fact, Anupam Rasayan, although it was a late entrant into fluoropolymers business, it is getting huge MOUs and forward contracts. Similarly, Navin Fluorine is also working on newer molecules for lithium and battery casing which requires fluoropolymers. Now, these are very high-margin, high-value niche applications. So, fluoropolymers is going to remain another space to look forward to."

A bench of Justices Surya Kant and K V Viswanathan presided over a petition addressing safety concerns related to train accidents. The court directed petitioner Vishal Tiwari to submit a copy of his plea to the Attorney General's office.

The bench requested the Attorney General to update the court on protective measures, including the implementation status of the 'Kavach' scheme, and inquire about the potential financial implications of introducing this system nationwide.

""Is there any kind of exercise undertaken that how much financial implication will be there on the 'Kavach' system in case it is introduced on a pan-India basis,"" the bench asked. ""Everything has co-relation with financial aspect because ultimately the burden will be passed on to the passengers,"" it observed.

The bench posted the matter for hearing after four weeks.

Tiwari told the apex court that his plea centered on public safety measures concerning train accidents.

Indian Railways manages the fourth largest railway system and the length of railway routes across India is reportedly over 68 thousand kilometers.

According to the railway ministry's data, significant train mishaps have seen a considerable decline from 473 in 2000-01 to 135 in 2014-15, further dropping to 48 in 2022-23. Between 2004 and 2014, there was an average of 171 consequential train accidents annually, which notably decreased to an average of 71 per year from 2014 to 2023.

However, the country witnessed a devastating train disaster in June, involving a three-way collision between the Bengaluru-Howrah Superfast Express, the Shalimar-Chennai Central Coromandel Express, and a goods train. This incident resulted in numerous casualties, marking one of the worst train disasters in two decades. There were concerns about a possible signaling failure contributing to this tragic crash.

The petitioner today referred to the Balasore district train accident, stressing the urgent need for a protection system to prevent train collisions, highlighting previous accidents caused by train collisions.

The plea urges the court to direct the formation of an expert commission, headed by a retired Supreme Court judge, to evaluate and enhance the railway system's safety measures. It also demands immediate guidelines for implementing the 'Kavach' system within Indian Railways. The petitioner attributes the non-implementation of the 'Kavach' system to a significant loss of lives and public property, holding the authorities accountable for negligence and a breach of duty.

Tiwari highlighted the significance of preserving the lives and safety of citizens, stressing the government's responsibility in ensuring the same. He urged the government to provide detailed information to the apex court regarding their actions in addressing these concerns.

The plea seeks directives from the Centre to establish an expert commission, led by a retired Supreme Court judge and comprising technical experts. This commission aims to assess the risk and safety factors within the railway system, propose systematic safety enhancements, and submit its findings to the court.

The plea contends that the delay in implementing the 'Kavach' system has led to substantial loss of life and public property. It accuses the authorities of gross negligence and breaching their duty of care.

Additionally, it calls for immediate guidelines for the integration of the 'Kavach' system within the Indian Railways to ensure enhanced safety measures.

The plea urged the government to take clear steps in implementing measures to prevent railway accidents. It demanded the need to reinforce these measures to prevent future mishaps and uphold the constitutional right to life and liberty as stated in Article 21 of the Constitution.

Pointing to train accidents over the last 30 years, it said the authorities have been slow in establishing an effective safety protocol to prevent collisions and mishaps.

""The enforcement of safety mechanisms of train protection system is still not done at ground level throughout the country as it has been clearly proven that Kavach, which is an Automatic Train Protection System, was still not applied on this route…"", the plea said.

The plea said there is urgent need to promptly install the 'kavach' protection system, stressing that train operations should not proceed without its implementation.

ONGC and OIL stock is trading at a discount to international peers in spite of its recent run-up.
Analysts are divided on GAIL as its petchem capex and losses are a cause of concern.
OMCs like Indian Oil, HPCL and BPCL have closed the valuation gap and a rally is unlikely from hereon, believe brokerages.
Few stocks can claim to have juice left as markets hit staggering heights as 2023 bid goodbye. Public sector unit or PSU oil stocks like ONGC, OIL and GAIL are a rare few which still hold value. Thanks to production expansions, regulatory consistency and more the government owned companies are set to better days ahead.

Most of the oil stocks have given over 60% returns in the last one year, with the exception of BPCL and ONGC. Yet, the upstream companies especially are trading at a discount, claim brokerages.

Thus, going ahead, Antique Stock Broking believes that ONGC and Oil India remain among the cheapest upstream stocks globally despite a rally in the last six months. “We believe the current valuations do not fully reflect the jump in realization of both oil and gas over the last 6-18 months and the resultant cash flow,” it said.

Both the companies are expected to see significant free cash flows starting FY24, after the gas prices increased via Administered Pricing Mechanism by the government. Not only will it improve margins, but improved price realization would lead to much more attractive returns on their annual capex.

“We believe positive momentum in the upstream sector would be led by a shift towards companies with undemanding valuation, while we find fundamental support led by steady earnings and cash flows on the back of regulatory consistency, stable commodity prices, and margins and triggers in the core production outlook,” said a report by Emkay.

The long-term fundamentals of the stocks are intact say analysts even as government's changes in windfall tax might cause shortt-term movements.


ONGC & OIL: The production rise

Oil India’s production has already increased in the current financial year, while ONGC is expected to commission KG 98/2 gas fields soon. There are other production increases planned as well.

ONGC targets to increase production to 50mmtoe by FY28 from 40mmtoe in FY23. It will be driven by 23 ongoing projects, with a total capex of ₹60,000 crore.

Oil India’s production increase plans will commence sooner as it expects IndraDhanush Gas Grid (IGGL) to be completed by March 24. Apart from increased production, it also aims to secure a premium pricing for its gas, adding to the stock’s appeal.

“The management expects to secure a 20% premium on the current gas pricing formula for gas produced through new wells. The company is confident that wells utilizing IOR/EOR techniques will also qualify for the 20% premium, provided the company meets the minimum threshold achieved in the last decade,” said a report by Motilal Oswal.

Moreover, dividend yield of both these companies is also good – at around 5-6%, beating their PSU peers who average at around 4%.

GAIL: Value unlocking in offing

On GAIL, which too is an upstream company, analysts are divided. The stock has seen a good run-up with the rise in oil prices last year, but did not see a fall when these crude prices fell. That’s due to the company’s plan to achieve transmission volume of 130-132 mmscmd by FY25.

“The stock has been even stronger due to optimism of higher transmission volumes. We believe that despite the recent strong gas consumption data, India’s medium-term gas demand outlook is weak and LT (low temperature) outlook is even weaker,” said a report by Kotak Institutional Securities.

Added to that, its petchem business delivered losses for the fifth consecutive quarter in Q2. Its LPG business is expected to return to profitability in the second half of the current financial year but losses could also come back during the summers, worry analysts.

“Despite weak profitability, GAIL’s further large capex in petchem has been a key worry,” says Kotak.

Sharekhan however believes that GAIL can post a strong earnings recovery over FY23-26, across business segments supported by stabilising global LNG supplies and improving price environment for its commodity businesses.

It identifies other triggers for the stock price too, like value unlocking. “GAIL is evaluating for monetization of city gas distribution CGD assets and the same helps to unlock value from its stake in GAIL Gas,” said Sharekhan.

OMCs: Capacity expansions too far in the future

Oil marketing companies like Indian Oil, HPCL and BPCL on other hand too are planning capacity expansions. But only HPCL’s is likely to see benefit of volume growth over FY24-FY26 due to the expansion of its Visakh refinery, and petchem expansion at subsidiary, HMEL Bhatinda.

IOCL is implementing refinery and chemicals expansion projects, but its volume growth is likely to flow through after FY26. BPCL’s volume growth from petrochemical expansion at Bina and Kochi can be visible only after FY28.

OMC stocks have been gaining momentum due to fall in crude oil prices, but most experts see prices inching up to $80/barrel on account of geopolitical tensions. Brokerages believe that a further rally from the current prices for these stocks is unlikely.

“We acknowledge that a higher discount on Russian crude is not likely and that proximity to general elections will limit any near-term upside to marketing margins despite moderation in crude oil prices,” said a report by Bob Caps."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/most-pregnant-women-are-deprived-of-vitals-vital-for-maternal-health-fetus-growth-finds-new-study/articleshow/106457044.cms,"Our bodies require many important vitamins and minerals in order to function well.

B vitamins, for example, are particularly important for many of our everyday functions - including energy levels, cell health and nerve function.

These vitamins become even more important when a mother is pregnant, as low levels of some vitamins (such as folic acid, also known as vitamin B9) are associated with poor health outcomes during pregnancy and for the infant after birth.

Since our body only makes many of these micronutrients in small amounts (if at all), we get the bulk of them from our diet. But our recent study showed that the majority of expectant mothers are missing out on many important vitamins - which could potentially have an affect on, not only their health, but their infant's too.

We conducted a large study of over 1,700 women aged 18-38 in the UK, Singapore and New Zealand. We studied their health before, during and after pregnancy.

Before pregnancy, we found that nine in ten of the women had low blood levels of many important vitamins, including folic acid, riboflavin, vitamin B12 and vitamin D. These vitamins are needed to support the mother's health during pregnancy, and are important for the unborn baby's development.

For the next part of the study, we randomly placed participants into two different groups. One group received a standard pregnancy vitamin supplement, which contained folic acid. The other group received an ""enhanced"" supplement, which contained folic acid, as well as riboflavin, vitamins B6, B12 and D. The amount of vitamins in the enhanced supplement was similar to what you can buy from pharmacies and supermarkets without a prescription.

Both groups took these supplements daily starting from when they were trying to get pregnant and throughout their pregnancy. They stopped taking them after delivering the baby.

We found that the enhanced supplement helped improve blood vitamin levels and reduced the prevalence of vitamin deficiency during pregnancy - especially when it came to riboflavin, vitamin B6 and vitamin D. The standard supplement increased levels of folic acid, but levels of other vitamins worsened during pregnancy. This was probably because of the increased needs during this time.

Riboflavin is important during pregnancy as low levels can mean a higher chance of having a low blood count and anaemia.

For vitamin B6, the group taking the standard supplement had lower levels in the later part of pregnancy, meaning they might not have enough of this vitamin. Previous research has suggested vitamin B6 may provide some relief from pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting.

In both groups we saw a drop in homocysteine levels, with this being particularly marked in those taking the enhanced supplement. A lower homocysteine level is actually a good thing as it indicates a lower likelihood of vitamin deficiency. High homocysteine levels are linked with early pregnancy loss and a range of pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia.

The benefits of the enhanced supplement on the participants' vitamin B12 levels lasted six months after having a baby. This is probably important for the mother's ability to supply her baby with vitamin B12 if she breastfeeds. B12 helps children's brain development and growth.

Important Micronutrients
Though our study included women from three different countries and various ethnic backgrounds, few black and American Indian women were included in the research. This means the results might not represent the experiences of women from these specific ethnic groups. It will be important for future studies to investigate vitamin levels in these groups.

The precise benefits of the improved vitamin levels will also need to be investigated further in future studies. But, we might speculate that the supplements will have additional benefits, based on what previous studies have shown.

For example, our previous research has shown that women taking the same enhanced supplement had lower rates of pre-term delivery, and also a lower risk of major haemorrhage after delivery of the baby.

It's also well-known that folic acid is important during pregnancy, as it can help prevent major defects to the developing baby's brain and spine. Taking a folic acid supplement before conception and in the first part of pregnancy is routinely recommended.

But many pregnancies are unplanned and a significant number of women do not take folic acid supplements in early pregnancy. This is why around 80 countries have introduced mandatory fortification of staple foods. But many experts feel that the level of fortification in foods may not be enough for pregnant women, which is why a supplement will still be important.

Taking vitamin D supplements before and during pregnancy may also have benefits, including reducing the chances of infantile atopic eczema (a condition which causes patches of itchy, cracked and sore skin) and improving bone health in children.

Overall, our study showed that most women living in high-income countries don't get enough essential vitamins in their diet - even before they get pregnant. Several of these vitamins are crucial for the infant's development in the womb.

Although some of these vitamins can be found in meat and dairy products, it's clear that the majority of women still aren't getting enough of them regardless of what sort of diet they follow. As more people choose to eat more plant-based foods, better advice about vitamin-rich foods will be needed. Many women may probably need to start taking supplements to ensure they get the vitamins they and their baby need."

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/aurangabad-and-coimbatore-aim-at-providing-24-hour-water-in-18-months/articleshow/106459423.cms,"Taking a leaf out of Odisha's urban reforms, other states are queuing up to introduce 24x7 water supply. Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar (Maharashtra) and Coimbatore (Tamil Nadu) are aiming at introducing round-the-clock water supply in 18 months.

The ministry of housing and urban affairs has approved around 610 projects in 590 municipal wards where 24x7 water supply will be available over the next three years. The projects have been approved under the second phase of Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). Under this scheme, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar has taken the lead and is likely to be the first city to provide 24x7 water supply across the city. The Puri project was part of a state initiative. About ₹3,300 crore has been sanctioned for the ambitious project in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar and about 25% of the work has already been completed. Similarly, Coimbatore will also introduce 24x7 water supply. Work contracts have been awarded for 156 of 610 approved projects.

Speaking to ET, AMRUT mission director D Thara said, ""Providing 24x7 water supply in a city requires management of the same water resources. The city has to invest in smaller diameter pipes and create additional storage so that water can be supplied round-the-clock. Initially, it may lead to water wastage till the residents get used to the new facility. But in the long run, it is seen that this optimises water usage by the residents as they do not store water.""
ET Bureau

The 24x7 water supply, popularly known as the ""Drink from Tap"" scheme, was first introduced by Naveen Patnaik-led Odisha government. Puri became the first city in 2020 to get 24x7 water supply. It has also been extended to several suburbs of other cities including Brahmapur, Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Rourkela, Sundargarh, Besnagar, Khurda, Jatni, Hinjilikatur, Ladbil, Joda, Keonjhar and Anandpur.

In AMRUT-II, the Centre has decided to introduce round-the-clock water supply in at least one ward in each of the 500 AMRUT cities. ""Seeing the benefits of 'Drink From Tap' scheme, cities are now queuing up with these projects. In fact, some have pitched for the entire city to be covered,"" said Thara adding that cities have to invest in building additional storage which could be a time-consuming process. While 27 suburbs of Bhubaneswar have been covered by the state government, the Centre has now received proposals for the entire state capital to be covered under ""Drink From Tap"" by tapping into central funds.

On Monday, the Indian stock exchanges had asked the company to issue clarification on the news article.

Citing sources, the Hindu Business Line report said that BHEL emerged as the best bidder, pipping L&T-MHI after the financial bids were opened on Friday.

Under the contract, BHEL will build three ultra-supercritical units of 800 MW each for NLC India at Talabira, the report said, adding that NLC has added a fourth unit of 800 MW to the project. The EPC tender was for the first three projects, the report claimed.

It is not clear whether or not there would be a separate tender for the fourth unit, the report said.

The price action has been supported by strong volumes as over 6 crore shares traded on the NSE on Monday and 5.48 crore today. The traded value of shares stood at Rs 1,106.08 crore.

The stock is trading in an overbought zone with momentum indicators RSI and MFI at 73 and 79.4, according to Trendlyne. A number above 70 is considered as overbought while below 30 is oversold.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/chennai-office-market-at-all-time-high-in-2023/articleshow/106459489.cms,"The Chennai office market touched record highs in 2023, with net absorption of about 6.6 million sq ft, behind only big office markets like Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Delhi-NCR due to available office assets and high-quality talent pool, according to real estate consultant JLL.

The city ascended to fourth place and led the list of top six cities in office absorption in Q4 of 2023, contributing over 3.32 million sq ft.

According to JLL, the average rental in Chennai is between 3.5 million sq ft and 4 million sq ft per year.

“The Chennai office absorption was boosted by the resilience of the millennial technology workforce, particularly evident in CyberCity Chennai, where the return-to-work rate has consistently exceeded 90%,” said Sriram Khattar, vice chairman and managing director, DLF Rental Business. “Global technology and BFSI companies are recognising the potential of accessing high-quality talent and premium real estate at significantly lower costs than in their home countries.”

DLF expects to have about 14 million sq ft of commercial space in Chennai once DLF downtown Taramani is completed.

“Once completed, Chennai will be second to our Gurugram portfolio,” said Khattar.

Global capability centres (GCCs) drove Chennai-market activity, notably in the manufacturing and industrial segments and flex, with 34.1% and 25.9% market shares for 2023, respectively. Large corporations like Bank of America, Fidelity, Vesta, Citibank, and Qualcomm used a lot of floor space.

“Chennai is emerging as the new office capital of South India, offering a compelling blend of affordability, talent and infrastructure, proving a catalyst for businesses of all sizes,” said Ritesh Sachdev, senior vice president of Tata Realty and Infrastructure Ltd. “The city's commercial real estate sector is growing, making it a lucrative option for developers and occupiers.”

The city also saw the resumption of huge deals of up to 400,000 sq ft. New completions, such as DLF Downtown, and recent developments, such as RMZ Paramount, have seen strong leasing.

""CapitaLand Investment has witnessed Tamil Nadu's transformation over the last 18 years since we entered Chennai, and the city is now among the fastest-growing markets within India for CLI, where we have the most diversified portfolio of assets,” said Sanjeev Dasgupta, CEO of CLI India. “To date, CLI has invested S$750–800 million in Chennai, and we expect to invest over S$500 million in the next five years across multiple asset classes, with a special focus on IT parks, logistics, and data centres.”

The city's robust technology and manufacturing base, as well as its educational institutions that offer STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) courses, are expected to be a big draw for new GCC entrants.

The Tamil Nadu R&D Policy 2022, which provides incentives such as electricity and stamp duty concessions to GCCs and R&D centres, is also expected to boost the presence of global firms in the city.

Chennai is also seeing significant improvement in infrastructure, with enhanced connectivity through metro lines, expressways and international airports.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/fresher/class-of-2024-why-the-ticket-to-a-job-is-beyond-a-college-degree-nowadays/articleshow/106471921.cms,"The next few months are crucial for final-year college students. It involves selecting a line of work, going through placement processes and interviews, and generally taking the first steps towards the rest of their lives. The process can lead to more questions than answers.

This series, the Class of 2024, aims to simplify the way to navigate the world beyond the campus by talking about the sectors with opportunities, ways to use online platforms and preparing resumes, among other things.

The sixth of the 10-part series explores why and what certifications young jobseekers should get beyond their college degrees.

As jobs become more specialised, certifications are required to bolster degrees in many cases, especially for college freshers.

S Pasupathi, Chief Operating Officer, HirePro, says pairing certifications and job-linked apprenticeship programmes with a degree can significantly enhance a student’s employability and job prospects.

So what are the technical certifications usually in demand?
Data from Coursera shows that Indian learners are more likely to be developing AI-related skills than learners in most countries, over-indexing on artificial neural networks, applied machine learning and machine learning algorithms. Coursera saw 1.8 million enrollments in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) courses in India in January-September 2023; the learners were mostly in their 20s, according to self-reported learner data.

Searches for generative AI-related terms (such as GPT, LLMs, GANs) by learners on Coursera increased 230% YoY in April 2023.

Focus on microcredentials
Higher education institutions are leveraging industry microcredentials such as entry-level online professional certificates from leaders like Google, IBM and Meta to help new graduates stand out to employers, says Coursera. These courses fill skill gaps, prepare students for digital jobs and enable employers to validate graduates’ skills.
Some of the popular microcredentials among Indian customers are IBM Data Science, IBM Full Stack Software Developer, Google Data Analytics, Meta Front-End Developer and Google UX Design.

Coursera data shows that 21% of Indians who completed entry-level professional certificate courses got a new job.
Data from a global survey by Coursera reveals that 96% of Indian students agreed that earning an industry micro-credential would help them secure the job they wanted. About 92% of employers in the country — higher than the global average — said industry micro-credentials helped a job candidate stand out. About 85% of hiring decision makers in India would be more likely to hire a candidate who has completed a professional certificate. About 82% of students said they would be more likely to enrol in a degree if it included professional certificates.

Sectoral growth opportunities
Abhinanda Sarkar, Faculty Director at Great Learning, says some domains students should upskill in are data science, AI/ML, cybersecurity and management.

Data science: The boom in AI is leading to renewed demand for data scientists. Python, says Sarkar, will continue to be the language of choice, and many in the class of 2024 will have to enter the professional world with some level of competence in Python.

Apart from the explosive growth of large language models there are quieter trends in voice recognition and intelligent chatbots. Natural language processing (NLP) is now a core competence. Working with other languages of global business (e.g. Mandarin) or languages of local importance (e.g. Telugu) will be a valued skill, he says.

What is needed is the right way to pose questions, i.e. prompt engineering. The class of 2024 will have to develop the skill of being natural prompt engineers; the most creative of them will do fine tuning as well.

Machine learning operations skills are the intersection of ML and software engineering and they have become valued (still rare) skills, says the faculty director at Great Learning.

Cybersecurity: As more and more data gets stored and transmitted online, demand for cybersecurity experts has steadily increased. This may be on both defensive and ethical hacking sides.

The class of 2024 will need to be multifaceted in their talents to be good security experts in the age of multi factor authentication, says Sarkar. Cybersecurity in the age of IoT devices has become even more important as credit card and other transactions often pass through devices such as wireless card readers. Certifications such as CompTIA Security+ are placing added emphasis on IoT, he says.

Digital marketing: Target segments of brands are often the young and the restless. They prefer content delivered to them in short, yet engaging, formats — this creates opportunities in digital marketing. The class of 2024 will consume as well as create such content extensively, says the faculty director at Great Learning.

Given the competition for online attention, SEO will continue to be something that marketers will be expected to get right, including voice SEO.

Management: Graduates planning a career in management will have to focus on both the details and the big picture, says Sarkar. He gives the example of fintech: it is a broad area where each aspect is technically sophisticated because of the use of AI in robotic process automation (RPA) for, say, transaction processing, payables and receivables management, among others.

Cloud computing: Cloud computing is the mainstay of AI and data storage. The class of 2024 will develop their applications with demands on data and computing that will rapidly change. For example, LLMs will get bigger and more devices will connect to the IoT. Obtaining certifications from AWS and Microsoft Azure, among others, is a place to start when working on such competencies, says the faculty director of Great Learning.

Design thinking: Design thinking is a collection of principles that are useful in designing objects for human use, as well as software that is human-centric. It is as much about engineering as it is about “look and feel”, says Sarkar. Humanities students can make vital contributions. The class of 2024 can play a role in designing safe digital spaces using AR/VR.

Sarkar also points out that sustainability is increasing in demand. This is a great time to build a career in clean energy and affordable healthcare, he adds.

Clients are delaying decisions on tech investments and cancelling projects because of recessionary cycles in the West, says Hari Krishnan Nair, Co-Founder of Great Learning. This is forcing major IT firms to seek only highly skilled talent, often not readily available through campus recruitment.

“This widening gap not only adversely affects employability but also diverts many graduates from making the right career decisions. Most of the companies hiring candidates from Great Learning are valuing industry relevant skills. This only accentuates the need to bridge the existing skill gap in young graduates through application-based capstone projects that simulate real-world scenarios and application-oriented learning. Furthermore, industry professionals serving as mentors can ensure that students acquire relevant insights into the industry,” he adds."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/lemon-tree-shares-jump-6-as-motilal-revises-target-upwards/articleshow/106471920.cms,"Shares of Lemon Tree Hotels jumped over 6% to the day’s high of Rs 126 after Motilal Oswal reiterated a buy stance on the counter and raised its price target to Rs 150 from an earlier target of Rs 135. This is a 26% upside over Monday's closing price of Rs 119.

The price action was supported by strong volume action as nearly 87 lakh shares traded on the NSE around 10 am.

The target upgrade in Lemon Tree comes on the back of the company signing a franchise agreement for an upcoming hotel in Mussoorie, Uttarakhand. This opening will be in addition to its eight existing and seven upcoming hotels & resorts in the state, the company filing of December 28 said.

In a note, Motilal Oswal said that Lemon Tree Hotels has established a niche for itself in the growing mid-market hospitality segment and is now expanding its wings by improving its presence in the upscale/luxury segment and increasing its inventory through management contracts. ""We believe the company is set to benefit significantly from the sectoral tailwinds and emerge as a larger and stronger player,"" the domestic brokerage said.

The company is expected to benefit from the changing dynamics in its key markets such as NCR. Rising demand in these cities and slower supply should propel the growth trajectory of existing players, the brokerage note said.

Its Mumbai property Aurika Sky City is positioned as an upper upscale hotel and will be a key beneficiary of the trickling down of demand from the luxury segment. The hotel is expected to contribute to 21%/23% of consolidated revenue/EBITDA by FY26, Motilal said.

The company also has a strong pipeline of 3,354 managed rooms which are expected to become operational by FY27, taking the share of managed rooms to 55%, the note said.

Lemon Tree shares have delivered over 50% returns in the past 12 months, outperforming Nifty which has given 19% returns during this time. The stock is currently trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving average.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/truck-drivers-protest-why-truck-bus-drivers-petrol-pumps-are-up-in-arms-against-modi-govt/articleshow/106469157.cms,"Truck Drivers Protest News: For the second day in a row, severe disruptions to commuter traffic occurred across the nation as truck and bus drivers demonstrated against a recent central government law. Long queues were observed at petrol pumps in various cities across the country, and commuters also faced problems as bus operators and drivers were also on strike. Along with petrol, vegetables, fruits, and essential goods, supply was also affected due to the truck strike. The traders warned that the situation may turn worse and that there could be a price rise in commodities if protests don't end.

The truck and bus drivers, along with petrol pumps are protesting against the newly enacted Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS), which has a provision for hit-and-run cases. The new penal actions in hit-and-run cases have raised concerns among drivers who now face the possibility of a 10-year jail term for fleeing and not reporting fatal accidents.

Under the previous legislation, drivers could be imprisoned for up to two years under IPC Section 304A (death by negligence). The protesting drivers are demanding the repeal of these new provisions, asserting that the stringent penalties are a threat to their livelihoods.

As per a TOI report, at NH-34 in Bulandshahr, a group of drivers gathered on the road, causing traffic blockades in opposition to the law.

Jagat Pal Sharma, a 46-year-old truck driver, expressed the concerns of many drivers, stating, “We only get Rs 10,000-12,000 as salary. How do I pay lakhs of rupees as a fine? We will be forced to do some other jobs if this decision is not rolled back. This is a threat to our livelihood.”

The reports of protests have emerged from across the country. Transport unions and drivers claim that they now face a peculiar situation under the new law if any driver stays back after the accident he will be lynched by the public and if he runs away he faces a 10 year jail with a heavy penalty.

Transporters are criticising the government for lack of consultation with stakeholders before amending the law, highlighting flaws and asserting that transporters and drivers are significant contributors to the country's economy.

Instances of road blockades from across the country were reported yesterday and the situation is likely to remain the same today as well.

In response to the demonstrations, concerns have been raised about potential disruptions in the supply chain and the worsening shortage of drivers across the country. The industry is apprehensive about increased harassment, extortion, unnecessary detention, and legal consequences. Transporters and driver organizations are appealing to the government to address the issues raised by the new law, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive and consultative approach to legislative changes.

The telecom stocks which are part of the S&P BSE Sensex index, hit a record high of Rs 1046 on 5th December 2023, but it failed to hold on to the momentum.

The Sensex stock formed a strong base above 960 levels which was a crucial resistance level in October 2023.

After hitting a record high in December, the stock took support above the same and bounced back. The support of 960 also coincides with the 50-DMA on the daily charts.

The Supertrend indicator also triggered a buy earlier in December on the daily charts. The stock rose more than 1% in a week and over 8% in the last 3 months.

In terms of price action, the stock is trading below 5-DMA but above 10,30,50,100 and 200-DMA on the daily charts, which is a positive sign for the bulls.

The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 66.4. RSI below 30 is oversold and above 70 is considered overbought, Trendlyne data showed. The daily MACD is above its center and signal Line, this is a bullish indicator.

“Bharti Airtel is in continuous uptrend and forming higher top-higher bottom formation on higher degree charts. It has retested breakout on the daily chart and is inching higher,” Arpit Beriwal, Analyst, Equity Derivatives & Technicals, MOFSL, said.

“Overall, chart setup is positive, and small declines are being bought into. It has formed a strong bullish candle on a daily scale and supports are gradually shifting higher,” he said.

The momentum indicator Relative Strength Index (RSI) is positively placed which indicates strength in the stock.

“Looking at the overall chart structure we are recommending buying the stock with a stop loss below 985 levels on a closing basis for a target towards 1111 zones,” recommended Beriwal.

Ltd, says “maybe one will have to wait for the corrections in the market to buy some of the PSU companies if at all one wants to buy. I still believe that the PSU companies are great business models but sustainability of growth will have to be experienced by the market going forward in the coming year and as the government is spending on infrastructure, 15-20% growth is a safe assumption.”

Which is a PSU that you are still comfortable buying at the current level?
Deven Choksey: I guess, most of the companies have probably corrected or rather re-rated themselves on the valuations front and so from the perspective of looking at something which is very undervalued, that situation is no more there. REC and PFC performed significantly last year; they basically re-rated themselves in a given situation after the cleaning up of the balance sheet and after seeing the surge in the offtake in the loans. They were still using it at around 1.5% price to book value. They got corrected and they got re-rated and they probably got the valuation which they deserve today.

A similar situation is happening with most of the public sector companies, great models, great businesses but the valuations have already reached to a level at which one could possibly say they are now fairly valued at this point of time. So immediately there is nothing that comes to mind where one could possibly ask for buying into the portfolio.

Maybe one will have to wait for the corrections in the market to buy some of the PSU companies if at all one wants to buy. I still believe that the PSU companies are great business models but sustainability of growth will have to be experienced by the market going forward in the coming year and as the government is spending on infrastructure, 15-20% growth is a safe assumption. Beyond that, if the market has assumed higher growth and given higher valuation, some of these companies might end up giving a rude correction in times. One will have to be a little bit more careful about buying into euphoric conditions into the PSUs.

What is looking euphoric in PSUs – metals, power, railways, defence because PSU itself is like a big basket of a variety of businesses?
Deven Choksey: You touched upon metals and that metals could be one which could possibly be surprising the markets going forward. On one side, the demand situation is significantly improving, on the other side, the input cost, the energy cost is remaining on a lower side and this is a perfect combination of formulas for generating higher amounts of profits in the coming period. We remain distinctly convinced and bullish about the possibilities of metals giving a record performance in 2024 and beyond. That is one space one would like to get into whether it is PSU or private sector but we believe that the companies could end up giving relatively better performance in the coming period.

Two smallcaps moving this year?
Deven Choksey: One of the reasons for some of these smallcaps moving is largely that the values in the hands of individuals have actually increased in their portfolio and as a result of which, their ability to buy some of these smallcap companies in the portfolio is remaining extremely high. In fact if you notice some of the IPOs and the pre IPOs also most of the times the family offices and HNIs are the ones who want to bid for these companies in their portfolio largely because of the fact that their portfolio size itself has grown to such a size more than some of the smaller mutual funds that they are in a better position to buy into this company that as a result of which higher demand is generated.

Because of this higher demand generated and then lower floating stock, comparatively the ability to buy into the portfolio remains extremely high for this HNIs and the family offices and that is resulting into significantly stretched valuations in some of the small cap companies and the mid-cap companies where probably discounting has been far beyond FY25 and FY26. But to a greater extent, I feel it is due to some of the shortages in the market as far as the new papers are concerned.

Given the size of money that the people are holding, that is a reason for which these companies are commanding higher valuation. Maybe they are due for some correction in the coming period, may not be a sharp correction, but it would definitely be a time correction that one would expect out of these companies.

Latest reports seem to suggest that now there is a bit of a marginal deterioration across metrics in NBFC space and asset quality is going to be very keenly monitored and you are going to see some growth pressures coming in for the likes of a Muthoot Finance, LIC Housing Finance, PNB, CanFin etc. What is your view on the entire sector? Do you think the view is turning a little bit cautious within the entire NBFC basket?
Deven Choksey: Most of the NBFC companies are having a good situation in terms of collecting high deposits and that is where the pressure is arising that with the higher amount of deposit getting collected they are also wanting to basically be deployed in a quick succession and that is where mistakes are happening. I would rather like to stay with the larger NBFC companies like Bajaj Finance, like Poonawalla Fincorp, where the ability to lend I think is definitely there but at the same time ability to assess the credit profile of the borrower is extremely high by these companies. So that gives one the confidence that these companies are unlikely to create non-performing assets in their bookings.

To a greater extent, I would think one will have to stay with the quality players in the NBFC space. You cannot generalize everything at one scale and probably we will have to remain watchful about the euphoric conditions happening in some of these companies. We believe that even if there is a gradual growth in companies like Bajaj Finance with around 30% kind of CAGR growth which continues, it is safer to buy and stay in these kinds of companies than to buy into some of the smaller ones who are vulnerable to the situations.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/consultancy-/-audit/regulatory-scrutiny-on-big-four-network-and-others-over-audit-services/articleshow/106471636.cms,"The National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), the regulatory body overseeing listed and large unlisted companies in the country, is scrutinizing the audit and non-audit services provided by the Big Four network and other firms to their clients, reported TOI.

The concern has been raised in numerous inspection reports published by the agency, as well as in at least six disciplinary actions it has undertaken. The regulatory body perceives a conflict of interest or independence concerns in the services performed by these firms.

While NFRA does not have its own guidelines, it goes by the provisions of the Companies Act and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India's audit standards and guidelines, including the Code of Ethics, which lists out possible threats, including those related to self-interest, self-review, advocacy, familiarity and intermediation.

In certain instances addressed by the regulatory authority, disciplinary measures were taken due to multiple infringements. For example, in some cases, the firm exceeded the specified limit for earnings from non-audit services. Additionally, there were occurrences where the cap on revenue from a single client was violated.

In one case the partner of a firm and related entities had a large shareholding in one of the companies that was audited, which NFRA believes is a conflict of interest.

These occurrences have been identified not only in numerous smaller firms but also in certain network affiliates of the Big Four, drawing scrutiny. In a recent inspection report, the NFRA determined that Walker Chandiok & Co, Grant Thornton Bharat, Grant Thornton Advisory, and Grant Thornton International are considered ""'directly or indirectly' related"" entities, despite the firms denying any connection.

NFRA has also found instances of firms undertaking prohibited non-audit work through a web of their affiliates. In certain cases, such as BSR & Co, the firm did not provide details of KPMG network entities, and non-audit services provided by those entities to audit clients.

There are certain services such as management or tax-related work that is allowed, the corporate affairs ministry as well as NFRA are of the view that the fee structure allows for possible conflict of interest, especially as the payment for non-audit work can be front-loaded or staggered as the guidelines do not provide for a framework over a period of time.

In light of this, three stocks have formed a strong setup on the charts for further rally, giving a good risk-reward ratio.

Here’s the trading strategy from Sheersham Gupta, Director and Senior Technical Analyst at Rupeezy:

Tata Chemicals - Inverted Head and Shoulder Breakout
Tata Chemicals had been consolidating in the range of 900 and 1150 for the past two years. But last week, the stock saw fresh momentum to cross its 50-day Moving Average (DMA).

1100 was a short-term resistance for the stock which was broken with good volumes. Daily RSI is at 73 indicating strength in the stock.

On the derivative front, huge put writing was seen even on strike prices above the At-The-Money (ATM), and buying was seen on the call side depicting the bullish sentiment in the stock.

Thus, Tata Chemicals can be bought for a target of 1195 for the short term. The stop loss for the stock will be 1078 on a closing basis.

Agencies

Hero Motocorp- All-Time High Breakout
Hero Motocorp touched a high of 4090 in 2017 and since then has been trading below this price level. Last week, the stock broke this level with good volumes and is now consolidating to retest the breakout level.

The Daily RSI for the stock is 71, however, the weekly RSI is 81. So, consolidation for the short term can be expected.

On the derivative front, call writing was seen indicating the stock may pause for a while before continuing its upward march.

Hence, it is suggested to buy Hero Motocorp for a target price of 4480 and the stop loss will be 3975 on a closing basis.

Agencies

Concor- Rounding Bottom Pattern Breakout
830 was the all-time high for Concor which was broken last month decisively with good volumes. Now the stock is consolidating after the breakout of this level indicating breakout confirmation.

The weekly RSI is 73 and the daily RSI is 65 indicating a good upside potential for the stock.

On the derivative front, huge writing was seen on the put side and buying was seen on the call side indicating the conviction of the traders on the upside.

Technical analysis and option chain data suggest Concor is a good bet for buying for a target of 940. Stop loss can be placed at 818 on a closing basis.

In a digital proclamation, Google urges users to join in the countdown with the words, ""3… 2… 1… Happy New Year! This Doodle brings some sparkle and shine to start the New Year right! As the clock nears closer and closer to midnight, people around the world are planning their New Year's resolutions and wishing for success, love, joy, and everything in between.""

December 31: A Universal Turning Point
Acknowledging the significance of December 31 in the Gregorian Calendar, this day marks the official conclusion of the year, universally known as New Year's Eve.

It is alternately recognised as Old Year's Day or Saint Sylvester's Day in various countries, inviting individuals to reflect on the past and embrace the promise of a fresh beginning.

New Year's Eve Reflections & Resolutions
This occasion encourages people to cast aside the shadows of the past, providing an opportune time for reflection on lessons learned. Many choose to celebrate globally, revelling in the company of friends and loved ones.

Moreover, it serves as an opportunity for individuals to make New Year's resolutions, promising themselves positive changes and personal growth in the upcoming year.

Global Celebrations: Fireworks, Parties & Anticipation
The eve itself is marked by widespread festivities, featuring spectacular fireworks, joyous parties, and celebrations of all kinds.

Across the globe, billions of people eagerly await the striking of midnight, a symbolic moment that ushers in the much-anticipated New Year's Day. With over 24 time zones, the countdown becomes a global spectacle.

The Google Doodle for New Year's Eve adds a touch of sparkle and brightness to set a positive tone for the coming year. The countdown to midnight is not merely a farewell to the old but also a collective moment of anticipation, where individuals worldwide gear up to set their New Year's resolutions.

The Origin of Google Doodles: A Unique History
Delving into the history of Google Doodles reveals a fascinating origin story. In the years 1998 to 2003, Google crafted 5000 doodles, celebrating occasions and honouring notable personalities.

The concept of Google Doodles originated from an unconventional ""out of office"" message in 1998 when co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin replaced the second ""O"" in Google's logo with the Burning Man logo. This act, just days before Google's official incorporation, marked the inception of Google Doodles, a tradition that predates the formation of Google, Inc. itself."

The 73-year-old real estate magnate shared his insightful journey from Mumbai to Ulhasnagar in an AC coach through a video on Instagram, which quickly went viral, accumulating over 37 million views and more than four lakh likes.

In the video, Hiranandani can be seen waiting at the platform alongside other passengers, boarding the AC coach with a few members of his team, and engaging with fellow commuters during the 30-minute ride.

His decision to use public transport garnered mixed reactions from the online community, with some praising his down-to-earth approach, while others questioned his choice of the AC coach over the regular local.

Hiranandani explained his strategic decision, stating, ""Saving time and beating traffic with the city's lifeline, a journey from Mumbai to Ulhasnagar in an AC coach was an insightful personal experience.""

He also added a touch of pop culture by including the viral theme song from the recently released 'Animal' movie in the video.



While many commended the billionaire for his unconventional choice of commute, with one user writing, ""This is nice. More industry leaders should use public transport; that will encourage the government to provide better services to people,"" some critics pointed out that he had boarded the handicapped coach, reserved for individuals with physical disabilities, pregnant women, and cancer patients.

This observation sparked discussions about the importance of adhering to coach-specific reservations. A user wrote, ""I appreciate you teaching people to use more of public transportation. I also request you to set an example by not taking a coach that is reserved for people with disabilities if you do not have disabilities.
In case you do, please ignore my comment.""

Despite the mixed reactions, Hiranandani's decision to travel via Mumbai's local train highlights the practical challenges faced by even the wealthiest individuals in navigating the city's traffic congestion.

The video not only offers a glimpse into the daily struggles of Mumbaikars but also emphasises the need for improved public transportation and infrastructure development."

Indian exports of these products were earlier attracting additional duties in the US, as Washington, in 2018, imposed a 25 per cent import duty on steel products and 10 per cent on certain aluminium products on grounds of national security. In retaliation, India in June 2019, imposed additional customs duties on 28 American products.

The US is now allowing these imports from India without paying the extra 25 per cent and 10 per cent duties in return for New Delhi's decision to remove retaliatory duties on eight American products like apple and walnut.

The official also said that the two countries have agreed to set up a joint monitoring mechanism to enable domestic exports to America of at least 3.36 lakh tonnes of certain steel and aluminium products in a year without paying extra duties.

The department of commerce has finalised the terms of references with regards to joint monitoring mechanism (JMM) to enable domestic exports of certain steel and aluminium products to America without paying extra duties and the US has conveyed their agreement with the proposed text.

""Ministries of mines, steel and DPIIT have been requested to establish an internal monitoring mechanism to monitor export of steel and aluminium products to the US specifically under US 232 measure,"" the official added.

As per the mechanism, officials will meet twice a year to review the arrangements.

If Indian exporters would face any bottleneck or problem, it would be conveyed to the commerce ministry and will be taken up with the US during the meetings of the joint monitoring mechanism (JMM).

During the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June last year, the two countries decided to remove trade irritants and as part of that, both sides agreed to end six trade disputes at the WTO.

They have mutually resolved those seven disputes and India has decided to remove additional duties on eight US products, including chickpeas, lentils and apples, which were imposed in 2019.

The US, on its part, has agreed to provide greater market access to certain Indian steel and aluminium products, a development which would help increase outbound shipments of these goods. The US has agreed to grant market access to steel and aluminium products under the exclusion process of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act 1962.

This market access has restored opportunities for Indian steel and aluminium exporters, which were restricted since June 14, 2018, because of the US 232 measure under which additional duties were levied on steel and aluminium products respectively.

The additional tariffs had impacted USD 1.21 billion worth of India's exports of steel and aluminium to the US in 2018. The duty burden on exports due to additional US tariffs amounted to USD 241 million.

The US had settled a similar dispute with Canada and Mexico at the end of 2019.

While steel and aluminium imports from these countries got exemption from the extra tariffs, called Section 232 tariff, the agreement provided for aggressive monitoring and a mechanism to prevent surges in imports of steel and aluminium.

All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon virgin Mother and Child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

To sleep with peace in the world of equity investments is difficult to imagine. But what if there is a demonstrated predictable process with a proven outcome and track record?

In addition to sound processes for investment which enable one to navigate the rough terrain of investments and permit one to sleep peacefully, it is important to have a solid emotional base and understanding of what is happening in the immediate surroundings as well as understanding what happened historically if one wants to be a successful investor or for that matter successful at navigating life.

Without the base or the processes, biases can creep in, impacting life and investment decisions. We all construct our own processes and understanding but it is always useful to look at inputs from others who have been successful in navigating the world of investments and life situations.

Success in life situations can be described as those who have learned to effectively navigate the ups and downs of life and not be bogged down.

One of the role models many investors looked at was Charlie Munger for his wisdom in investments and in other areas of life. He navigated his life after losing his spouse and child at an early age as well as losing one of his eyes.

Some of the important takeaways from him are:
Reading and having mental models are important for living and investing and the legendary investor Charlie Munger, espouses it very well. He was a voracious reader and his readings included psychology, finance, letters from well-known investors, philosophy, and other subjects.

In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn’t read all the time—none. Zero. You’d be amazed at how much Warren reads—and how much I read. My children laugh at me. They think I’m a book with a couple of legs sticking out.” – Charlie Munger

He was not a value investor in the conventional sense i.e., buying stocks at a discount to the fair value. He believed in investing in good companies at fair prices and expecting these companies to generate handsome compounded returns over the long term.

There are scores of such companies in the Indian context too from consumer companies to banks that have compounded in the past and are poised to compound in the future. These compounding benefits really accrue if the investors remain invested for a long- a crucial aspect that many ignore and fall prey to short-term speculation or trading.

In addition to investment advice, one of his favourite advice was to invert any situation and look at the problem in reverse.

He also spoke of motivations caused by incentives and keenly looked at incentive structures to study what motivated the CEO or board to undertake certain business decisions.

Since he studied psychology, he understood well the foundations of good decision-making. He invested in areas he understood well and avoided those that he did not.

This is always such a powerful lesson to investors. For instance, many investors in the last few years lost to Bitcoins without any clue on how it works.

It had become popular, and many stories floated around leading naïve investors to invest and lose. Following Charlie Munger's advice would have saved many.

Losing money is losing capital and is worse when it is lost in ventures that are not well understood. Moreover, the loss of capital lowers the benefits from compounding.

Staying the course was another important lesson, He did make mistakes but that did not stop him from investing further. He took the lessons from those investments and then moved on. E.g., he acknowledged that it was a mistake to have invested in Ali Baba.

In his personal life also, after losing his wife and son at a young age, he continued with his work diligently despite being devastated.

Knowledge from multiple areas, a discipline to follow and implement what he learned, and following the age-old principles of honesty and hard work, led him to live a fairly rich life, not only in terms of wealth but in other areas of life as well.

He was an investor, philanthropist, writer, businessman, and vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.

For those interested he has also recommended many interesting books from diverse fields. Some of the interesting ones include Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, and Fiasco: The Inside Story of a Wall Street Trader.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/study/tougher-international-student-visa-norms-come-into-force-in-the-uk/articleshow/106457179.cms,"Effective this month, international students, including those from India, enrolling in British universities will face stringent visa norms limiting the inclusion of family members. The changes, initiated by former home secretary Suella Braverman and effective from Monday, primarily impact postgraduate research courses and those with government-funded scholarships.

The UK Home Office emphasizes that these adjustments, aiming to curb the misuse of student visas as a gateway to employment, are projected to result in approximately 140,000 fewer individuals arriving in the UK.

The revised regulations specifically target the escalating trend of overseas students bringing dependants, a practice labeled as ""unreasonable"" by Home Secretary James Cleverly. Official figures reveal a staggering 930% increase in dependant visas since 2019. Cleverly stated, ""This government is delivering on its commitment to the British public to cut migration,"" further emphasizing the strategy's role in preventing an estimated 300,000 people from entering the UK.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that, by September 2023, 152,980 visas were issued to dependants of students, a substantial surge from 14,839 in September 2019. UK Minister for Legal Migration and the Border Tom Pursglove justified the move, stating, ""We are completely committed to seeing a decisive cut in migration."" He clarified that restricting dependants on student visas allows the UK to protect public services while supporting the economy.

(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates)


The UK government, led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, intends to strike a balance. The changes to student visas aim to preserve the appeal of the UK's higher education sector while preventing institutions from exploiting immigration rather than focusing on education. The government plans to collaborate with universities to develop an alternative approach for outstanding students to bring dependants.

As part of a broader strategy to reduce migration, the UK government is implementing additional measures, including tightening health and care visas, increasing salary thresholds, and commissioning a review of the post-study work visa. Indian nationals, constituting 43% of students granted leave to remain, are a significant group in the student visa category.

Diaspora student groups have expressed concerns about the proposed review of the post-study work visa, a vital factor for Indian students choosing UK universities. The Home Office assures that the phased introduction of these measures throughout early 2024 provides affected individuals with ample time to prepare for the upcoming changes, making this the largest reduction in migration ever implemented."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/budget-2024-will-interim-budget-roll-out-the-red-carpet-for-tesla/articleshow/106315068.cms,"Budget Expectations: In recent years, India's drive to get Tesla be part of its localisation push has increased and trade minister Piyush Goyal's visit to Elon Musk's auto factory added wings to the dreams. Goyal had also said that the US-based electric vehicle major would double its imports of auto components from India. Tesla Inc.'s Chief, Elon Musk, met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June in New York. Following the meeting, Musk expressed intentions to visit India in 2024.

The Austin-based electric vehicle (EV) giant had pursued reduced import duties on EVs in India in 2021, aiming for rates slashed to 40% from the existing 70%-100%. Tesla eyes India's burgeoning middle class in one of the most promising EV markets globally.

Back in August 2021, Musk hinted at the possibility of Tesla establishing a manufacturing unit in India, contingent upon the success of imported vehicles in the country. He highlighted Tesla's interest in introducing its vehicles to India but pointed out that the country held the highest import duties among major nations, which posed a challenge.

However, India had in the past stated that Tesla will have to manufacture cars in India and not China if the company wants to come and sell vehicles here. Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari had in 2022 said Musk will not get any special treatment when it comes to customs duties.

But now things seems to be moving fast for India to roll out the red carpet to bring Tesla's investments and policies can likely feature in the interim budget.

Tesla's Gujarat plant likely to be announced during Vibrant Gujarat in presence of Elon Musk: Report

Tesla's potential investment aligns with India's economic objectives, boosting manufacturing's GDP share and job creation. R

Economic Times had reported citing sources carmaker Tesla is willing to invest up to $2 billion for setting up a local factory if the government approves a concessional duty of 15% on imported vehicles during its first two years of operations in India.

India levies a steep 100% import duty on cars with cost, insurance and freight value of more than $40,000, and 70% on vehicles that have a lower price tag.

Tesla has approached the union government with a detailed proposal linking the quantum of investment to the number of cars it can import at lower duty, ET reported. The company is willing to invest up to $500 million if the government extends concessional tariff for 12,000 vehicles and can increase this up to $2 billion if the reduced duty is approved for 30,000 vehicles.

Will Tesla be able to produce a Rs 20 lakh EV for Indian masses?

Reports indicate that India is contemplating tax reductions on fully assembled electric vehicle imports, potentially spanning five years, aiming to attract companies like Tesla Inc. to market and potentially manufacture their vehicles within the nation.

According to Bloomberg's sources, the Indian government is formulating an electric vehicle policy that would enable global automakers to import battery-powered vehicles at concessional duty rates, provided they commit to local production in the future.

Tesla's possible entry via tax reduction could reshape the EV landscape in India. However, India's budget will then have to balance this advantage with local automakers' concerns.

Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, major Indian players, have voiced concerns about reduced EV taxes, emphasising the need for early-stage government support. These manufacturers worry about increased competition from globally favored high-end EVs due to tax cuts.

Any electric vehicle policy in the interim budget, especially favoring overseas players like Tesla, poses challenges for India's mass-market car manufacturers. The budget's decisions will then impact not just Tesla's entry but also the future landscape for local EV manufacturers.

Tesla is anticipated to unveil its Indian plant's plans during January's Vibrant Gujarat Summit, attended by CEO Elon Musk, as per media reports. The selection of Gujarat aligns with Tesla's export-focused strategy, aiming to serve both local and global markets, as reported by the Ahmedabad Mirror.

Earlier, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were being considered by the company given the well-established ecosystems for electric vehicles and exports.

CRISIL projects imports to escalate further, possibly touching the 6 million tonnes mark this fiscal year. Global steel demand has been subdued but demand growth in India has bucked that trend to rise 13%, according to Crisil.

The surge in steel imports, predominantly from China and routed through Vietnam, raises apprehensions for domestic steel producers while India advocates for localisation.

The Indian Steel Association (ISA) has flagged the persisting worries of escalating imports and soaring raw material prices, terming it as ""dumping of steel products"" in the market.

The domestic steel makers would thus want India to narrow the entry gate of these products and they will be eying the interim budget for support.

According to reports, India ha been mulling safeguard measures akin to the European Union's quota system to mitigate inflow surges. An announcement in the interim budget on those lines will be worth watching out for.

Reports also suggest India may consider imposing import restrictions across ports and revisiting the lesser duty rule.

Last year, the steel industry had sought from budget stringent safeguard measures, including higher import duties and reinstating anti-dumping measures on various steel products.

In a recent interview to PTI, Minister of State (MoS) for Steel Faggan Singh Kulaste said the government is working for a revamped Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme 2.0 for the steel sector, highlighting the government's focus on bolstering the industry and ensuring raw material availability.

With India positioned as the fastest-growing major economy, anticipating significant infrastructure development and manufacturing capacity expansion under 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat', the steel industry calls for amplified government capital expenditure to drive infrastructure development. Increased budgetary allocations towards the PLI scheme are also sought by steelmakers to fortify the industry's growth trajectory.

As the industry braces for increased government support, the momentum in government capital expenditure is pivotal for sustained growth. The looming interim budget is anticipated to unveil measures addressing the challenges faced by the steel sector, navigating a balance between domestic manufacturing fortification and managing the influx of imports.

Other popular altcoins, such as Solana and Avalanche, rose 9% and 10%, respectively. XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Polkadot, Chainlink, and Shiba Inu surged 3-7%.

The global cryptocurrency market cap rose 6.02% to around $1.74 trillion in the last 24 hours.

The total volume in DeFi is currently $7.43 billion, 12.62% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $50.74 billion, which is 86.21% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.

""BTC successfully surpassed a significant resistance at $44,500, now aiming for new resistance levels at $45,800 and $48,000. The previous resistance at $44,500 could act as a support, providing confirmation of the bullish trend through a retest,"" said CoinDCX Research Team.

""While ETH has been relatively slow in recent days, it continues to establish new higher highs. The real momentum for ETH is expected to pick up once BTC stabilizes. Technically, ETH needs to clear the resistance level at $2,450 to initiate a strong upward movement,"" it said.

Tech View by Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO, Unocoin
Bitcoin's recent rally has placed it at $44,700, breaking above previously discussed resistance levels. The cryptocurrency's positive momentum challenges the bearish outlook presented yesterday and is now trading comfortably above the critical $42,965 level.

A break of the resistance points at $43,857, $44,679 and $45,962 signals potential strength in the uptrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 39 previously indicated caution, but recent price gains add optimism.

Despite staying below the 50-day EMA, now at $42,983, Bitcoin's ability to resist a bearish engulfing pattern near $42,985 suggests resilience. The ascending trendline support at $41,750 remains a crucial defence, shaping a more bullish near-term outlook amid evolving market momentum.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/funding/softbank-took-home-1-8-1-9-billion-from-four-listed-portfolio-companies/articleshow/106458432.cms,"SoftBank, which of late has not been signing new startup funding deals in India and is preparing to offload stakes in IPO-bound Ola Electric and FirstCry, still holds $1.1-1.2 billion worth of shares in its listed portfolio companies here.

The Japanese investor has sold stakes worth $1.8-1.9 billion during the public offerings and through post-listing sales in four Indian startups — Paytm, Zomato, PB Fintech and Delhivery — that went public in 2021 and 2022. It had invested a total of $2.3-2.4 billion in these four new-age companies.

SoftBank’s strategy to dilute holdings through secondary sales while staying away from new investments is in line with most growth and late-stage investors who have slowed down on investments over the last 15-18 months.

SoftBank, which has funded almost a fifth of India’s over 100 unicorns — startups with valuations exceeding $1 billion – has so far invested $15 billion in the country. Of this, $11 billion had been invested by SoftBank Vision Fund. The group invested the remaining $4 billion in sectors such as renewable energy and infrastructure.

ETtech

SoftBank is the largest institutional shareholder of electric two-wheeler maker Ola Electric and retailer FirstCry. Both companies filed draft papers for their initial public offerings last month.

While Ola Electric is looking for a $7-8 billion valuation in its public offering, FirstCry is estimated to be valued at around $4 billion. At these valuations, SoftBank is expected to sell stakes worth approximately $180 million in FirstCry and $45-50 million in Ola Electric.

In Ola Electric, SoftBank will be selling 23.8 million shares, representing a 0.65% stake, while in FirstCry, it is planning to offload 20.3 million shares, or a ~4.5% stake, as per their draft IPO documents. After the IPO, it would still hold stakes worth an estimated $840-850 million in FirstCry and $1.4-1.6 billion in Ola Electric, at IPO valuations.

The story so far

SoftBank had invested $1.6 billion in fintech company Paytm, has so far realised $800-900 million of its stake, and is still holding another $550 million worth of shares at the current stock price. In the Paytm IPO, SoftBank had sold shares worth around $250 million.

Among the four listed companies, Paytm is proving to be a drag on SoftBank’s investments in India. The financial services firm’s stock ended Monday’s trade at Rs 646.25, nearly 70% lower than its IPO price of Rs 2,150 in 2021.

With PB Fintech, the Gurugram-based parent of Policybazaar, where it had invested about $200 million, SoftBank has already realised returns of three to three-and-a-half times by offloading stake worth $650 million. It is still holding a stake worth another $130 million.

In Zomato, SoftBank got a stake through its $300 million investment in quick-commerce platform Blinkit (then Grofers), which Zomato acquired in 2022 in an all-stock deal. The investor has grossed $340 million by selling its stake in Zomato.

In the new-age logistics firm Delhivery, where SoftBank still holds around 12%, the investor has realised around $200 million from paring its stake. It had invested a total of about $380 million in the Gurugram-based company, where it still holds a stake worth $400-450 million.

Beyond the listed space too, SoftBank has made exits in new economy companies — the biggest being Flipkart where the investor sold its 20% stake to Walmart for $4 billion in 2018. SoftBank had invested about $2.5 billion in the ecommerce marketplace.

In 2021, however, SoftBank re-joined Flipkart’s cap table, as a co-leader in a $3.6 billion funding round through SoftBank Vision Fund-II.

More recently, the investor made a secondary stake sale in Lenskart as a part of the eyewear retailer’s $600 million funding round, realising an estimated $90-100 million from the deal.

In August, SoftBank Vision Fund’s executive managing partner and chief financial officer Navneet Govil told ET in an interview that in addition to FirstCry, several other portfolio firms including food-delivery platform Swiggy, business-to-business ecommerce player OfBusiness and Lenskart were also in various stages of preparing for their IPOs."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/windfall-tax-on-crude-hiked-to-rs-2300-per-tonne/articleshow/106467473.cms,"The centre on Tuesday hiked windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil to Rs 2,300 per tonne from existing Rs 1,300 per tonne.

It cut the export duty on the diesel to nil from 0.50 per litre and also reduced duty on Aircraft Turbine Fuel (ATF) to nil from earlier Re 1 per litre.

The new rates will be effective January 2, central board of indirect taxes and customs (CBIC) said in a notification issued on Monday night.

In its last review on December 18, the government had sharply cut the windfall profit tax on crude oil produced in the country to Rs 1,300 per tonne from Rs 5,000 earlier. The export duty on diesel was also cut from Re one per litre to 0.50 while that on ATF was hiked from nil to Re one.

India had first introduced the windfall profit tax in July 2022. Back then, export duties of Rs 6 per litre each were levied on petrol and ATF, while it levied duty of Rs 13 per litre on exports of diesel.

The tax rates are reviewed every fortnight based on average oil prices in the previous two weeks.

Despite that, Maruti has again raised prices. So, even though metals have not done that much of an input cost, their optimism is seeing price rises which scares me. If realty, DLF is launching new projects on Sohna Road at 18,000 per square feet, these are crossing the affordable limits. The same is the case with a large part of the autos, they are actually pricing themselves to perfection and any slowdown in demand can see inventory build up. So, be very, very cautious on both real estate and autos.”

The update that we have got of UltraTech Cement for the quarter gone by seems to be a decent number. There is a 5% year-on-year growth and 2% quarter-on-quarter. What do you make of it because there has been a bit of a traction in cement stocks for the last couple of days?
Sanjiv Bhasin: That will be part and course of the construction activity. In NCR and Delhi, because of the strong fog and cold, the state government has come out against construction activity and so on. So, dispatches and consumption will be postponed for about a week or so. But I would use this as a buying opportunity in the sense that UltraTech and the five players control 53% of the entire market. At 138 million tonnes, even if a Rs 10 increase comes, you can imagine what the variables will be. By the first week of January, you will definitely see some price rise coming in cement.

So, it is a matter of time as the weather gets a little more moderate, construction activity will see more traction. We are seeing the same in infrastructure, in hydrocarbons, in real estate and the demand let up in road construction, all that means cement and steel are a natural conduit for that. As a disclosure, UltraTech is one of our top holdings and we are very optimistic about it. Even though there is not much room for comfort on the price, we still think earnings will be in line. So, buy on declines would be the call for UltraTech, Ambuja and Dalmia Cement.

What about your strategy when it comes to the entire auto sales numbers? That has been a bit of a mixed bag and slightly on the softer side this time around. How have you read into the auto sales numbers?
Sanjiv Bhasin: Yes and that is what we have been foreseeing. We have booked a lot of profit across the board in some of our top holdings. We continue to be overweight Ashok Leyland. Ashok Leyland and if you recall, from Rs 160-165-170, Ashok Leyland will be the biggest beneficiaries of more CV sales. They are eating into the market share of Tata Motor. Their bus market is doing a roaring business. Anything to do with electric vehicles, the bus side is seeing huge, the maximum amount of traction.

I can even state that Ashok Leyland is heading to 250 on a price performance but the business is doing extremely well. They are in all their verticals seeing the best traction ever. So, Ashok Leyland continues to be a top pick. You can also add one of the OEMs which we think is going to do well is Motherson Sumi. We had a buy close to Rs 65 on this. It has just started to see traction. But on the largecaps, be watchful, particularly the two-wheelers and M&M, that is where you should take some money off home.

Sanjiv Bhasin on why Ambani and Adani groups may power market in next 4 months

We discussed the hospitality sector and you talked about Indian Hotels being one of your preferred bets there. But Motilal Oswal is calling Lemon Tree their top pick for 2024. They have hiked the target price on that one. They are saying the stock has been scaling new heights and it is re-ignition of the convention centres which is going to boost the growth trajectory. They are not only dependent on leisure travel but also business travel and conference. What is your view specifically on Lemon Tree?
Sanjiv Bhasin: We had a buy closer to Rs 50 and we have actually booked out of that. We want to stay with largecaps. Like I said Indian Hotels is in our portfolio and as a conduit ITC. ITC hotels has seven-and-a-half thousand rooms franchise and that is 10% of their entire business. So, if you want to play the FMCG basket, cigarette basket and hotels, then it is better to be in a stock like ITC.

Also, I would like to put on record; 25th October was my birthday and you asked for a gift and I told you Diwali and my birthday gift was Vodafone at Rs 10.5-11. It has hit Rs 18.5. Yes, up 75% in two months and rocking. Some of the stocks have given huge returns but one also needs to be a little cautious because the final run of the bull market is always very pleasing but very painful in the end. Learn to take some money off the table and stay invested in the best of blue chips. Indian Hotels and ITC is where we play the hotel side and if you have been following ET Now and me, then take some money off Vodafone now.

Are we in for a bit of a slow patch for autos largely because run-up has been strong? Also, let us be clear that the seasonality effect will kick in whether it is December or January and typically, when you have one good year, the next year is not that great for autos. It is always a cycle which is at play.
Sanjiv Bhasin: Correct. I am very much in tune with you and I think we know the December and January effect and if you heard Mr Srivastava, he is telling us that they have never seen this type of numbers. So, you cannot have constant growth as we have witnessed in this year. I think next year will be more moderate. We will have just a statement of account on the budget.

There will be other impediments, but the growth rate remains strong. However, like you said stocks are priced above perfection, so there is no room for disappointment on monthly sales or quarterly sales. Despite that, Maruti has again raised prices. So, even though metals have not done that much of an input cost, their optimism is seeing price rises which scares me.

Just because 2023 was good, doesn’t mean we have to turn bearish & raise cash in 2024: Hiren Ved

If DLF is launching new projects on Sohna Road at 18,000 per square feet, these are crossing the affordable limits. The same is the case with a large part of the autos, they are actually pricing themselves to perfection and any slowdown in demand can see inventory build up. So, be very, very cautious on both real estate and autos.

Cautious on real estate, I just want to get it right, you said cautious on real estate?
Sanjiv Bhasin: Yes. I have interacted. I have done the footfalls this time and I see that the stock prices leave no room for comfort because now the pricing is going beyond the common man's reach. It is the end-use user, the end-use user is already bought. Now it is a speculation zone and the wealth effect of gold and stocks is driving this, particularly the new launches by DLF at 18,000 square feet at Sohna Road is far above the common reach. Any misstep in any macro, micro development will again see these inventory levels go up fast. So, be cautious there, take some money off the table.

What is this? Four things you have said you should sell, you have a reputation of being an evergreen bull, book profits, real estate is not looking good. What has happened? If the year changes, the view does not change. You have a reputation of being an evergreen bull.
Sanjiv Bhasin: Hamne paisa bhi toh banana hai aur paisa wo hai jo ghar leke jao. Samajh aaye na. Ahhi aap ko thoda bahut apne aap ko tone down karna chahiye ( I have to make money and real money which you can take back home. One needs to tone down a little).

The market is making money every day. I am very happy. I am a broker and brokerages will do well. As a disclosure we think that brokerages, insurance, exchanges, depositories, these are going to be the AMCs. These are going to rule the roost. So, there are enough ideas. All I am saying is be cautious of some of the outstretched valuation and when you get these big brokerage calls of absurd returns, I have a simple view having worked so many years with FIIs and others, when fools sell you should be buying, when fools buy you should be selling.

January may not be good for market as IT, consumer results could be truly bad: Samir Arora

Right now, if I have comfort it is in some of the PSU oil marketing companies, some of the pharma names. And if you want I can suggest two names which I think can outperform from here.

Please give the names.
Sanjiv Bhasin: BPCL and IOC, HPCL are going to be the darlings for this year, already HP, IOC have taken your breath with the move. BPCL is just poised to do that. Given that eight-and-a-half thousand crore was their profit after tax, EBITDA margin was at the highest, refining margins will do well, but I would say BPCL is the dark horse from here to the budget. It can see a 20% move and BPCL even though it is all the distillate businesses with it has underperformed actually the performance of HP and IOC. BPCL is something I put my money into.

The second is Lupin. Now as a disclosure Lupin has been in my portfolio for eight years. It has underperformed miserably. It is just coming back now, but their generic pricing, their new launches are doing exceedingly well and at 1300 if I can buy one largecap blue chip, it would be Lupin. So, I think 1500-1550 on Lupin is very much on the card and 550 on BPCL, these are two stocks which I can even buy at this price and be comfortable."

Alternatives had a 51% share of total inflows in Q4 2023, indicating strong demand in data centres, student housing, life sciences, and schools, amongst others.

Overall, student housing accounted for about 60% of the investment inflows within alternatives during the year, said Colliers.

""As India's real estate sector closes yet another promising year, institutional investments saw an increase of 10% and stand at $5.4 billion—the highest since 2020. The investments in Indian real estate are more broad-based, with significant investments coming into education, shared spaces, and data centres, adding to a strong domestic upcycle in office, residential, and industrial areas,” said Piyush Gupta, MD of Capital Markets & Investment Services at Colliers India.

Prominent funds such as Keppel, CPPIB, Brookfield, Kotak Realty Fund, HDFC Capital, Hillhouse Capital and Symphony Investment Holdings are looking to allocate funds to capitalise on the increasing demand for these asset classes.

The segment has also created new platforms between RIL, Brookfield Infra-Digital Realty, and Blackstone, as well as a tactical opportunity fund (Lumina CloudInfra).

“The year 2023 was a watershed year when the market made a decisive move from mainstream assets to alternate asset classes. This paradigm will further accelerate with purpose-built living and healthcare taking centre stage in 2024,” said Jasmeet Singh Chhabra, co-founder of JV Ventures.

In October, in the largest-ever student housing deal so far in India, real estate investment and asset management firm Alta Capital acquired Goldman Sachs' and Warburg Pincus’ 100% stake in the country's largest student housing platform, Good Host Spaces, for $320 million, or nearly Rs 2,700 crore.

While Singapore-based global real estate and infrastructure platform AGP Sustainable Real Asset has raised strategic funding to deploy across community infrastructure asset classes like warehousing, data centres, and renewable energy with India being a key focus market besides Europe and Australia.

“On the back of economic expansion, we are already witnessing a significant step-up in the demand for broader community infrastructure, including logistics warehousing, renewable energy, and data storage,” said Sunil Pareek, executive director of Assetz Property Group, AGP’s Indian real estate infrastructure platform.

Other notable deals include Kotak Realty Fund investing $133.6 million in Lalit Group and Symphony Investment Holdings investing $24.6 million in Isprava.

Institutional investments in the Indian real estate sector maintained steady momentum at $5.4 billion, rising 10% year-on-year in 2023 with the office segment being the highest contributor.

The year saw the highest levels of investment inflows since 2020, showcasing India's resilience despite uncertainties in global markets.

However, the overall investment inflows during the year remained sturdy; the last quarter of the year saw moderation with $0.8 billion in investment, a 37% year-over-year drop, as key global investment markets faced downside risks."

The board of the Washington-based International Monetary Fund is set to deliberate and potentially grant final approval for the disbursement of the next USD 700 million tranche for Pakistan under the existing USD 3 billion Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), the Dawn newspaper reported.

According to the IMF Executive Board calendar, upcoming meetings are scheduled for January 8, 10 and 11, with Pakistan's case slated for discussion on the last day.

The current IMF programme, amounting to USD 3 billion, is expected to conclude in the second week of April, with approximately USD 1.8 billion remaining undisbursed.

The initial tranche of USD 1.2 billion was released in July.

In November 2023, a Staff-Level Agreement was reached between the IMF staff and Pakistani authorities regarding the first review under Pakistan's SBA.

This agreement is contingent upon approval by the IMF's Executive Board. Despite expectations for board approval in December, it seems the process has been scheduled for January 11.

This development holds significance for Pakistan's economic landscape as the disbursement of the next tranche could provide much-needed financial support. The outcome of the upcoming meeting will shape the trajectory of the ongoing economic cooperation between Pakistan and the IMF.

""Discussions between the IMF staff and the authorities on policies to strengthen macroeconomic stability in the coming year continue, and important progress has been made over the FY23 budget,"" the IMF said in another statement.

The IMF also updated economic projections and data for Pakistan, depicting a challenging outlook for the country in 2024. According to the IMF's latest figures, the projected real GDP for the year is anticipated to experience a contraction of 0.5 per cent, indicating potential economic headwinds.

Simultaneously, the projection for the Consumer Price Index in 2024 shows a significant increase. This suggests a substantial rise in inflation, posing additional challenges for the country's economic stability.

Despite a surprise jump of USD 853 million in the reserves of the State Bank in the week ending on December 22, 2023, Pakistan is keen to receive the second tranche which shows Islamabad has fulfilled the IMF's demands for economic recovery.

The Ministry of Finance has recently announced that the July-December revenue collection target of Rs 4.425 trillion, given by the IMF, has successfully been surpassed by Rs 43 billion.

After securing the second tranche of USD 700 million this month, Pakistan is more likely to receive the remaining amount in March under the USD 3 billion SBA.

However, Caretaker Finance Minister Shamshad Akhtar had already informed the nation that the country needs to enter a new agreement with the IMF to revive the economy.

There is no hope that Pakistan could say goodbye to the lending agency. Despite tough conditions, Pakistan is still facing very high inflation which clocked in at 29.7 per cent for December from 29.2 per cent in the preceding month.

The latest data reveals that Pakistan has engaged in 24 arrangements with the IMF since becoming a member on July 11, 1950. This underscores the country's historical reliance on IMF support to address economic challenges, according to Dawn.

Pakistan has been facing balance-of-payments-related challenges, driven by a burgeoning trade deficit, every few years due to which the country has had 23 arrangements with the IMF over the past few decades.

The current programme with the lender was agreed to in 2019 when the country faced another balance-of-payments crisis. Since then, the IMF has disbursed about $4 billion to Pakistan, with a balance of $2.6 billion remaining.

Under the hood, these powerhouses might sport either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 or the Exynos 2400 chipset, with regional variations. For instance, the Indian variants are expected to feature the Exynos chipset, ensuring a speedy performance.

The camera capabilities of the Galaxy S24 line-up are another highlight, with the regular models rumoured to feature two powerful 50-megapixel cameras, while the S24 Ultra could showcase a robust 200-megapixel main camera, along with additional lenses designed for impressive zooming capabilities.

Leaked Pre-Order Bonuses and Additional Details
Recent leaks surrounding the Galaxy S24 series have not only unveiled pricing details but also shed light on pre-order benefits. According to a South Korean report, Samsung plans to sweeten the deal for early buyers.

According to South Korean blogger Naver, customers opting for pre-orders may receive a notable storage upgrade without any additional charge. For instance, if you pre-order the Galaxy S24 with 512GB storage, you could potentially get the 1TB version at the same price, mirroring a successful strategy used with previous Galaxy S models.

In addition to storage upgrades, Samsung is reportedly offering discounted prices for Galaxy Buds FE and the Galaxy Watch when purchasing a Galaxy S24 series smartphone. While exact discounts and watch models are yet to be revealed, this strategy aligns with Samsung's previous offerings for the Galaxy S22 and S23 series, as per a report by Sammobile.

As the January 17 launch date approaches, anticipation continues to build around Samsung's Galaxy S24 series. Stay tuned for more updates as the Galaxy Unpacked event unfolds."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/water-bodies-across-kashmir-freeze-minimum-stays-below-freezing-point/articleshow/106468729.cms,"Cold wave conditions prevailed in Kashmir valley with the minimum temperature remaining below the freezing point, the weather office said on Tuesday. A thin layer of ice has formed over the surface of the Dal Lake as the minimum temperature in Srinagar on Monday night was minus 4.8 degrees Celsius, officials said.

The residents of the lake, who live in houseboats, had a tough time breaking the ice layer while roving their boats towards the banks.

Water supply pipes have frozen in many areas of Kashmir due to extreme cold wave conditions.

Pahalgam in south Kashmir's Anantnag district, which serves as one of the base camps for the annual Amarnath Yatra, recorded a minimum temperature of minus 6.2 degrees Celsius, down from the previous night's minus 5.7 degrees Celsius, they said.

Gulmarg skiing resort in north Kashmir recorded a low of minus 4 degrees Celsius, the officials said.

Qazigund recorded a low of minus 4.4 degrees Celsius while Kokernag town saw the minimum settled at minus 2.7 degrees Celsius and Kupwara recorded a minimum of minus 4.6 degrees Celsius.

Kashmir has been going through a prolonged dry spell with no precipitation forecast over the next six days, the officials said, adding December month was 79 per cent deficit on rainfall.

There has been no snowfall in most plain area of Kashmir while upper reaches of the valley have also received lesser than usual amount of snow by the end of December.

The open skies have resulted in the minimum temperature sliding further in most parts, including Srinagar, the officials said.

Kashmir is currently under the grip of 'Chilla-i-Kalan' -- the 40-day harshest winter period when a cold wave grips the region and the temperature drops considerably leading to the freezing of water bodies, including the Dal Lake as well as the water supply lines in several parts of the valley.

The chances of snowfall are the highest during this period and most areas, especially the higher reaches, receive heavy snowfall.

'Chilla-i-Kalan' will end on January 31.

However, the cold conditions will continue after that with a 20-day-long 'Chilla-i-Khurd' (small cold) and a 10-day-long 'Chilla-i-Bachha' (baby cold).

Japan earthquake latest update

A day after a series of earthquakes hit Japan, news reports indicated over 20 casualties in the disaster. Rescue teams in Japan faced challenges reaching remote areas affected by a powerful New Year's Day earthquake due to damaged roads. The powerful earthquake, initially measured at 7.6 magnitude, caused building collapses and widespread power outages, had occurred on Monday afternoon. Many coastal residents fled their homes to seek higher ground due to tsunami threats along Japan's west coast. The waves swept away cars and houses into the sea. Transportation services in the region, including rail, ferry, and flights, have been suspended. (With Agency Inputs)

In a regulatory filing, Godrej Properties informed that the company has ""purchased a 4-acre land parcel on an outright basis.""

The land is located in Yeshwanthpur abutting the National Highway - 75, one of the prime locations in Bengaluru.

This project is estimated to have a developable potential of about 0.7 million square feet of saleable area comprising primarily of premium residential apartments, it said.

Godrej Properties said that the project has an ""estimated revenue potential of Rs 1,000 crore with scope to increase to Rs 1,250 crore basis additional 1-acre land acquisition, making it a 5-acre parcel.""

Godrej Properties, which is part of business conglomerate Godrej Group, is one of the leading real estate developers in the country.

Gaurav Pandey, MD & CEO, Godrej Properties said, ""Yeshwanthpur is an important micro market for us, and we are happy to add this land parcel to our portfolio.""

This acquisition will further strengthen the company's presence in Bengaluru, he added.

Seeking to encash strong housing demand, Godrej Properties has set a target of acquiring multiple land parcels during this fiscal that can help generate revenue of around Rs 15,000 crore post-development.

Last fiscal, Godrej Properties was very aggressive on land acquisition and added 18 new land parcels with sales potential of Rs 32,000 crore post-development.

Godrej Properties focuses on four markets -- Delhi-NCR, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Bengaluru and Pune, although it has projects in some other locations as well.

In November, Godrej Properties Executive Chairperson Pirojsha Godrej told PTI that the company would meet its target to sell properties worth Rs 14,000 crore this fiscal on strong demand for its ongoing and upcoming housing projects.

Godrej Properties had sold properties worth Rs 12,232 crore in the previous fiscal.

Already, during April-September 2023-24, Godrej Properties has achieved 48 per cent growth in its sales booking to Rs 7,288 crore, as against Rs 4,929 crore in the year-ago period."

It has raised its overweight stance on bank stocks and added Adani Ports to its portfolio.

""Nifty is now 20x 1-year forward - higher than the past 10-year average, but relative to EM (ex-China) the premium at 67% is only somewhat higher than the historical average. Also, on a PEG basis, the Indian market appears reasonable. Dec-24 Nifty target of 24,000 implies a 12% total return and assumes current multiple to sustain, helped by 12% EPS CAGR and strong flows,"" said Jefferies analyst Mahesh Nandurkar.

He said the team is positive on the domestic economy and capex and key picks are large banks (Axis, ICICI), realty developers (Lodha, Godrej Properties), power (Coal India, JSW Energy) 2-wheeler (TVS, Eicher), telecom (Bharti Airtel) and capital goods (Adani Ports, Kajaria).

On banking stocks, Jefferies said the sector has benefitted from sector rotation into largecaps seen in Dec'23. ""But even beyond that near-term trade, the sector stands out as the only sector with below-average multiples and possible earnings surprise if asset quality holds up. Also, more foreign flows from global mandates suit the large banks/financial theme well,"" Nandurkar said.

Slower incremental government capex growth could be a near-term negative for L&T, rail and defence stocks. ""We move some weight from L&T to Adani Ports (privatisation beneficiary) in our model portfolio,"" he said.

In 2023, FIIs poured in Rs 171,107 crore on Dalal Street. In the new year, foreign inflows are expected to improve on the back-peaking USD, Lok Sabha elections and the rising significance of India in global markets.

""India's relative positioning is still light in EM portfolios. Rising size is making Indian markets much more relevant for globally mandated funds. Meanwhile, structural positives such as the expected political stability, rising investment cycle provide multi-year growth visibility and peaking USD; is an ideal condition for higher foreign flows,"" Jefferies said.

Jefferies India Model Portfolio
Jefferies India Model Portfolio has taken an overweight stance on financials, telecom, materials, industrials, utilities and real estate.

Within autos, Jefferies prefers two-wheelers. In the healthcare sector, the preference is for the structural story of hospitals. Metals and Tata Motors are preferred plays on a potential China rebound.

Top picks include ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, SBI, Infosys, TCS, RIL, Bharti Airtel, ITC, Tata Motors, Sun Pharma, L&T, Adani Ports, NTPC and Coal India.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/startup-ecosystem-why-its-time-to-acknowledge-and-learn-from-challenges-of-2023/articleshow/106466745.cms,"The reality check theme was consistent across the ecosystem in 2023, with different versions tailored for various stakeholders. Founders came to the realisation that they need to consider foundational sustainable business models. They understood that the ""Growth at all costs"" approach comes with a hefty price tag, with consequences as dire as closure of the company.

Investors also recognised the necessity for a more active role in their portfolio companies. This involved providing support for growth decisions and exercising supervision over corporate governance. In essence, founders and investors alike grasped the importance of a thoughtful and sustainable approach, acknowledging that a balanced strategy is essential for the long-term success of businesses in the dynamic ecosystem.

Over the last five years, we've grown accustomed to receiving positive, record-breaking news. However, 2023 marked a departure with a record of a different kind. Startups in the country raised a mere $7 billion, the lowest amount in the past five years. This decline is primarily attributed to a substantial drop in late-stage funding, plummeting from $15.6 billion in 2022 to just $4.6 billion in 2023.

The numerous governance and performance issues in the poster-child startups of the country, coupled with a global capital slowdown, indicators of global recessions, and post-COVID market corrections, did not bode well for India's otherwise burgeoning startup ecosystem.

Even though funding dropped in 2023, some of the larger companies with cash reserves were able to acquire struggling products/companies at reasonable prices, resulting in over 120 acquisitions for the year. While this figure is lower than in 2022, it indicates positive signs of the trust that players from different sectors are placing in remaining India-centric in the long run. A small indicator of this trend was also evident in the exits that VC funds were able to secure in 2023, amounting to $3.46 billion across 79 deals.

The statistics indicate that 2023 served as a much-needed reset for the ecosystem, enabling investors to re-strategise and founders to become more resilient. In addition to re-strategizing, funds have spent 2023 raising new capital to build a reserve of cash for disbursement over the next 3-5 years, further bolstering belief in India's innovation and wealth generation capabilities among domestic and foreign investors. A total of 63 funds have raised over $5 billion, focusing exclusively on India, with 29 of these funds maintaining a clear focus on the early-stage ecosystem. The slowdown last year was not alleviated by the fact that funds consistently attempted early entries, with just under $2 billion raised by early-stage startups (Seed to Series A), compared to $5.4 billion in 2022. However, the outlook for early-stage startups appears quite positive from 2024 onwards, supported by high-innovation sectors such as BioTech, Specialty Chemicals, HealthTech, and DeepTech. This optimism is further reinforced by the emergence of new early-stage-focused funds and the revised strategies of growth-stage funds, which now include opportunistic early-stage investments.

2024: Providing hope
Government Expectations: Although the budget in 2023 did not significantly impact the startup ecosystem, the government took a series of steps to promote startups in India. Initiatives such as the Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS) scheme, Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS), and Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups (CGSS) were implemented under the Startup India initiative to provide capital at various stages of a startup's business cycle. The Central Government announced several measures, including tax concessions for startups, customs duty exemptions for EV-related capital goods and machinery, and the Drone Shakti Program. Additionally, the government supported agriculture-based startups by establishing the Agriculture Accelerator Fund, aimed at bringing affordable solutions to farmers' challenges.

With elections scheduled for 2025, I don't anticipate this budget to bring about significant changes for the startup ecosystem. Reports over the last couple of weeks indicate the government's inclination towards strengthening the DeepTech ecosystem, and we can expect the formation of some incubators/government funds for the same in 2024.


Founder Expectations: The theme of resilience is not expected to change anytime soon, as investors will likely remain cautious for the better part of the year. In my opinion, founders simply need to keep their heads down, establish two goals – one for the next 12 months and the other for the next 36 months – and back-calculate their actions accordingly. Startup funding is unlikely to be as uncertain as it was in 2023 and should gain momentum in the second half of 2024, as newer funds need to justify their investment timelines and drawdown commitments.

Downturns, like the one experienced in 2023, are a vital aspect of the economic cycle, and we typically associate such periods with success stories for the next decade. The overall growth trajectory of the Indian economy, and as a sub-function, the startup ecosystem, appears extremely positive over the next two decades. It's time to acknowledge and learn from the challenges of 2023, and evolve as an ecosystem.

Loaded with an extra day, leap years have a history of depressing Sensex, Nifty investors with big crashes as was noticed in 1992, 2000, 2008 and then again in the Covid lows of 2020.

A study of market performance since 1984 shows that the average annual returns in all the 10 leap years has been less than 8%. On the other hand, the return in non-leap years has been much higher at 23%.


The stock market's feud with leap years started from 1992 when the Harshad Mehta scam shook investor's faith. On 29th April 1992, Sensex dropped 12.77% in one of the worst market crashes in India. From the calendar year's high, the index closed 42% lower. But on an annual return basis, Sensex managed to end 37% higher.

In 2000, investors lost 21% in a global meltdown due to the dot-com bubble burst in the US.

The year 2008 was again a witness to one of the worst bloodbaths in the annals of Dalal Street when Sensex lost more than half of its value in the global financial crisis.

2016 also turned out to be a volatile year for investors as it was full of market-moving events like demonetisation, surgical strike and US elections.

The memories of Covid-led crash in 2020 are still afresh in the memory of investors. Although the index ended 16% higher with central banks flushing the market with funds, it wasn't without taking heart-wrenching plunges. It was also the first when Sensex hit a lower circuit limit and fell 12.71% in a single day on March 23.

Will 2024 be as bloody as other leap years?
The stupendous rise in Nifty, which hit another record high on the first day of the new year, has left bears without a vocal cord. But investors must not forget that most positive outcomes related to rate cuts and Lok Sabha elections have already been priced in leaving very little margin for safety.

While Kotak Institutional Equities expects a modest 1% rise in Nifty by December 2024, other brokerages have given targets going up to 23,000. The brokerage's fair value model shows the index is now close to 20% overvalued.

""Thus, we do not anticipate a large upside to the index from this point. The most likely outcome for the index in the next 6-9 month period seems to be a time correction,"" said Kotak's Anurag Singh.

On the technical side, Nifty charts indicate that the buying momentum may propel the index towards the 23000 to 23500 range. Since March 2020, there are six instances of 10% decline in Nifty. Each one of them was followed by an average 25% return in subsequent rallies before a correction ensued, said Rajesh Palviya of Axis Securities.

""Following a recent 7% correction, with Nifty declining from 20222 to 18837, applying the aforementioned analysis suggests a projection for Nifty in CY24 around 23,500,"" he said.

Even the study of leap years shows that there have been exceptions in 1988 and 2012.

As you get ready to splurge once again on equities, do not forget what author Morgan Housel says - Risk is what you don't see.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sustainability/fashions-sales-season-plastics-problem-isnt-about-packaging/articleshow/106466565.cms,"Until the rise of online retail, you might have been forgiven for thinking that all apparel was shipped in burlap sacks. Those wanting their garment spending to be sustainable these days can take comfort in reusable wooden hangers, paper shopping bags, and recycled fibres. The only glimpse of plastic in many fashion stores is the electronic equipment at the checkout.

Below that surface, however, the fashion industry is built on a mountain of artificial textiles. Global production of cotton and wool has barely increased since the early 1990s. Manufactured and synthetic fibres such as viscose, nylon and, above all, polyester have roughly tripled.
Bloomberg
That contradiction lies behind the sales-season fight between two of the rag trade’s biggest players. Inditex SA, the Spanish company that owns Zara, is at a stalemate in a battle over plastics with one of its biggest distributors, German online fashion giant Zalando SE, Bloomberg News reported last month.

Inditex is trying to cut its emissions in half by 2030 and wants to eliminate single-use plastics this year — but Zalando is balking at demands to stop distributing its clothing in polybags. These synthetic sacks are ubiquitous in the fashion trade, where they’re used to prevent items getting damaged on the way from the factory to the consumer. Bricks and mortar retailers typically remove them before products are laid out in stores, so until recently you’d have been forgiven for not knowing they exist. It’s only the rise of online retailers searching for quicker, cheaper ways of doing business that’s forced them into customers’ consciousness.

Who’s right? Inditex is to be commended for its efforts to improve its carbon footprint — but Zalando isn’t wrong to smell hypocrisy in this crusade. Packaging of every type comprises only about 5% of the carbon footprint of Inditex competitor Hennes & Mauritz AB, according to its 2014 sustainability report, the last time it put a number on it. That figure is unlikely to be very different at Zara, or to have changed much since. More than 70% of H&M’s total carbon footprint comes from producing the clothing itself, according to its 2020 report, with about 8% coming from non-garment goods including packaging.
Bloomberg
Polybags are popular because they stop all those emissions going to waste when moisture or dirt spoils clothing en route to the consumer. Patagonia, another climate-focused retailer, decided to keep using polybags in 2014 after an internal study found 30% of items that weren’t bagged became damaged to the point they were un-sellable. Inditex itself isn’t planning to eliminate plastics, either — instead, it’s promising to reuse and recycle all its bags.

The Zara owner isn’t the best-placed company to cast the first stone. The biggest contributor to fashion’s rising carbon footprint is that we’re buying more clothes more frequently. Until the recent debut of online giants Shein and Temu, there was no company on the planet that had done more to advance that trend than Inditex itself.

Its fast-fashion philosophy focuses on matching catwalk trends within weeks, using rapid stock changes and cheap materials that are easier to throw away than repair. Zara offers dozens of new collections every year, compared to an average of two among European apparel companies in 2000. Per-capita production of textile fibers rose 82% between 1995 and 2018 as fast fashion rose to prominence, inducing consumers to view clothes as disposable.

It’s particularly ironic that the fight between Inditex and Zalando should be breaking out into the open now. The post-Christmas sales season has long been an emblem of the industry’s struggles with sustainability. Even before fast fashion encouraged consumers to fill their wardrobes with surplus clothes, retailers were filling their stores with excess inventory that needed to be cleared out in an orgy of discounting.

Across the industry, only about 40% of clothing is retailed at full price, with half of the remainder getting marked down and the rest never being sold at all. Reducing that wastage would do far more to cut carbon footprints than getting into fights with distributors to sustain the pretense that you don’t use polybags.
Bloomberg
Fast fashion is often treated as the scapegoat for all the rag trade’s problems. That’s not entirely fair. Our mountain of clothing waste would probably be markedly smaller if Inditex’s competitors could match its legendarily efficient just-in-time supply chain. Inventory turnover, a measure of how much stock is sitting around on shelves unsold, is markedly better than at its major rivals.

Still, the best way to encourage a more sustainable garment industry will come from everyone buying a smaller amount of higher-quality apparel which can be mended rather than thrown away. In a world where more than half of clothes are made from cheap polyester, the disposable plastics you wear are a far bigger problem than the bags they’ve been delivered in."

This has just been accentuated by various steps the government has taken towards boosting the manufacturing, the capital goods sector. China plus one is a very attractive longer term theme. We are seeing a lot of states revive after a decade of weakness. The longer term themes in India that have come to compound well are in the banking and financial space and also consumer.

How do you think 2024 will pan out for the markets?
Ashi Anand: We start the year fairly optimistic. What has happened is for the last couple of years, we have had concerns around inflation, interest rates, geopolitical concerns, weak economic growth globally. A lot of these headwinds have basically been taken care of. There are a few things we are going to be watching over the current year. For the first time in many, many years, we are going to see interest rates likely to decline.

The Fed is expected to cut rates by up to three times over the current year. You are probably expected to see something similar from the RBI. So as compared to interest rates being a big headwind, it will start becoming a tailwind over the year. You have already seen FII flows start turning to be positive after three consecutive months of declines towards the end of the year.

From a technical and a fund flow perspective, interest rates declining is clearly very interesting. You are obviously going to have a dual election over the current year, both the Indian elections as well as the elections in the US. These would be important events to watch out for. But if we are looking at what the state elections have thrown up, it seems like the Indian election should not be too much of a surprise. So, there is a very strong backdrop for growth.

The longer term fundamental story of India is looking very, very robust. This has just been accentuated by various steps the government has taken towards boosting the manufacturing, the capital goods sector. China plus one is a very attractive longer term theme. We are seeing a lot of states revive after a decade of weakness. And the longer term themes in India that have come to compound well, are in the banking and financial space and also consumer. All of these are lining up quite well. So we are very optimistic about the market this year.

Long-term story for mid and smallcaps extremely exciting but may see time correction for a very short period: Akhil Chaturvedi

This is the most consensus call I have heard of late, which is that one needs to churn the portfolio towards large cap and book profits in midcaps and smallcaps. I know markets can stay irrational for a long time but time and again it has been proving them wrong. It is only the midcaps and smallcaps that continue to outperform versus the largecaps.
Ashi Anand: That is true. This is fundamentally a very difficult call. The risk adjusted returns look a lot more comfortable when you are looking at largecaps as compared to mid and smallcaps. However, we are seeing very strong sentiment and momentum in the smallcap space. And while there is a clear consensus that there is a lot of froth, this froth can continue over the short to medium term and could continue.

So timing when the markets will turn and when largecaps will start delivering more than small and mid, is very difficult. But the danger with investing in smallcaps at this point in time is that when markets turn, what you have seen historically is that when small caps fall, they can fall very, very sharply and at very low liquidity. So you may not be able to get out.

A lot of the gains you are making may just be paper gains, which you can lose quite significantly. So at least from our own portfolio positioning, we are moving more towards large and midcaps. We are only going towards smallcaps where we are very confident either of the story or underlying valuations. But whether the smallcap rally will sustain, timing that is very difficult.

Coming to Zomato and other platform companies like Nykaa or Paytm, what are you seeing in terms of value there? What is your view on these platform companies? You do have some bit of a holding here.
Ashi Anand: We are very confident about the space. But I just want to clarify that in terms of our outlook on that space; we see a tremendous amount of value creation taking place over the longer term. We are talking of over the next five to seven years. We believe we are going to become leading benchmark kinds of companies. They are going to be in key indices etc.

Which are the midcap and smallcap funds that look good for 2024? Nirav Karkera answers

What we are seeing is a tremendous amount of value migration taking away from traditional businesses towards these platform businesses. So we were talking about Zomato or Swiggy. It has just become so mainstream to order food as compared to even cooking at home. Now, while this has already caught up a lot, if you are just looking at the current penetration levels and compare this to global benchmarks, we have about six crore annual transacting users on Zomato in a population of about 130. China has over 50 crore transacting users.

Of the six crore annual transacting users, only about a quarter is consuming on a monthly basis. In China and the US, over 50% of sports consumption is spent on restaurants. In India, this is sub 10%. And this is just an example. I am just talking about food here, but you see something similar when it comes to payments, when it comes to the BPC space in Nykaa, across different kinds of platform businesses.

What we are seeing is a very interesting longer term value migration that can take place. We believe we are still in the early stages of growth for these companies, as these companies continue to grow at very-very attractive rates, and as they turn profitable, as we are seeing clear signs of them doing. We believe longer term profitability is actually well ahead of what markets are expecting or believe that these companies can deliver.

This combination of very strong growth and a shift towards high levels of profitability lay a very strong foundation for longer term value creation. How these stocks will perform in the shorter term is difficult to say, but we run a fund, we look at it as a quasi-private equity fund where in the near term you may see high volatility, but over the longer term, we will see very strong outperformance in all these platform companies.

Just because 2023 was good, doesn’t mean we have to turn bearish & raise cash in 2024: Hiren Ved

But apart from the platform companies which is the other sector that looks strong to you because financials, and especially the private banking financial names, the other set of stocks which are a consensus buy because fundamentally, if you talk about the credit growth, if you talk about the asset quality, and even the valuation for that matter, it looks attractive. But the stocks just do not budge at all?
Ashi Anand: A lot of fund managers are quite heavily exposed to the space, including us. I think the reason there is such strong consensus in terms of these names is most segments of the market, if you have growth, you are really having valuations being extremely expensive, right. So you are seeing this in defence, you are seeing this in capital goods, wherever there is a story, you are really having to pay up for the story.

In other pockets, where valuations may be a little more attractive, they are clear headwinds. So if you look at pharma and IT, you are clearly seeing those issues there. Now, banking, and I think the larger financial services space is a space where growth is very evident. This is a space that has been able to deliver growth and value creation well over the last couple of decades. And if you just look at all underlying trends, the ability for some of these private banks to continue to compound advances at over 15-20% quite comfortably without any major negative signs around asset quality, it just is a very interesting, consistent kind of compounding story that you are seeing in these platforms.

What we have seen over the last year is a certain amount of reversal as various parts of, especially capital goods, real estate, defence started to pick up. You have seen money flow away from what was a clear consensus around banking towards these spaces. But in terms of just the combination between growth, quality, and value, clearly financials look a lot more attractive than a lot of the other parts of the market and which is why even in our portfolios, it continues to be a key overweight.

I do not know if you agree with me or not because I do not find the valuations to be that comfortable. They are sitting at more than the five-year averages and if you go by the Q3 expectations, they are very muted. Even for next year, the companies are non committal about recovery. What explains the up move in the IT stocks that we have seen in the last month or so?
Ashi Anand: Relative to the market, valuations, especially in midcap IT, would probably be above five-year averages. But if you just compare it relative to other parts of the market, you are still seeing a much greater kind of valuation comfort in the space. Now, I agree in terms of the near-term outlook being quite uncertain. You have clear discretionary spends being quite impacted. You saw this in the last quarter. Essential results, which were declared a couple of weeks ago, did not seem to indicate any kind of near-term pickup that you are seeing out there.

However, what happens is that given the fact that we have crossed the peak of the US interest rate cycle, you have had the 10-year G-Sec, which had touched 5% fall well below 4%. You probably will start pricing in or looking at a potential revival in terms of global IT demand. And so markets would not really wait for those specific numbers to come in. One of the things over the current year, IT may be quite an interesting dark horse. While there is clear weakness in terms of near-term spends, the longer-term kind of story around increased digital spends, the need to kind of, a lot of enterprises are going to start spending on artificial intelligence that will have a certain amount of boost in the near-term for IT companies.

I think the combination of quality, growth and value is quite comfortable in the space. It is probably not going to perform too much in the near-term until you are not seeing clearer signs of an economic revival. But I think the moment you start seeing that in terms of global economic demand coming back I think the space could actually surprise markets on the upside."

The Kolkata incident, which garnered over 360,000 views on Goyal's X post, generated diverse reactions from users.

Netizens expressed their amusement, with one user commenting, ""With 125 items ordered, it's not just a celebration; it's a culinary marathon. Time to boogie and binge!"" Another user playfully questioned, ""Looks like a potluck. What are you contributing?""

Meanwhile, Goyal shared interesting statistics about Zomato's performance on New Year's Eve. One notable mention was Maharashtra, emerging as the state receiving the highest number of international orders.

The CEO also expressed gratitude to Zomato's delivery and restaurant partners for achieving an ""all-time high orders in a day.""

Goyal's updates weren't limited to this exceptional order. On December 31, he offered a glimpse into Zomato's operational ""war room"" through a series of pictures, showcasing the company's readiness for the bustling New Year's festivities.

In a broader context, Goyal shared that Zomato received a staggering 8,442 orders at 8:06 pm on New Year's Eve. Bengaluru secured its place as the city with the highest number of events booked and tables reserved on Zomato during this festive period."

However, New Delhi removed the tax on diesel and aviation turbine fuel, and it will also continue with no windfall taxes on petrol

The windfall tax on diesel, ATF have been removed, as against windfall taxes of 50 paise per litre and one rupee per litre earlier.

The new rates are effective from January 2, 2024.

On December 18, the tax, levied in the form of Special Additional Excise Duty or SAED, on domestically produced crude oil was cut to Rs 1,300 per tonne from Rs 5,000 a tonne. Further, the SAED on the export of diesel was reduced to 50 paise per litre from Rs 1 a litre.

India first imposed windfall profit taxes on July 1, 2022,, joining a growing number of nations that tax supernormal profits of energy companies. At that time, export duties of Rs 6 per litre (USD 12 per barrel) each were levied on petrol and ATF and Rs 13 a litre ($26 a barrel) on diesel.

The tax rates are reviewed every fortnight based on average oil prices in the previous two weeks.

A windfall tax is levied on domestic crude oil if rates of the global benchmark rise above USD 75 per barrel. Export of diesel, ATF and petrol attract the levy if product cracks (or margins) rise above USD 20 per barrel.

In an interview with ET, MakyMyTrip co-founder and group CEO Rajesh Magow said the industry outlook for 2024 looks promising, with continuing momentum in all travel and tourism segments.

“As the leader in the space, we will attempt to leverage this broader growth for our . We are committed to building new age products and features to ensure every customer becomes our brand ambassador,” he added.

He said the metamorphosis of MakeMyTrip brands is ongoing, with continuous advancements every month, every week, and every hour.

“Our recent product features such as Book@Zero for hotels and homestays, Trip Guarantee for rail, and Fare Lock for our flight customers, offer a lot of flexibility for customers to book trips in advance,” he said.

“Our ‘nearby destination' feature has not only enhanced the discoverability of 11,000 accommodations in 136 offbeat destinations but is also contributing to the sustainability of mainstream tourism hotspots by distributing visitor traffic to these less frequented locations. We are committed to continuing on this path, leveraging technology to address every use and need of Indian travellers,” he added.

Ankit Khanna, chief product officer, for hotel, growth and emerging businesses at MakeMyTrip said the company is the largest reviews and ratings platform for travel.

“We have introduced review summaries using GenAI to help users decide better and more quickly. Post-Covid, the emerging trend is that more properties are coming up outside city boundaries, hence the property is the destination itself,” said Khanna.

“Realizing this, we have introduced staycations across 30 cities and expanded city boundaries via nearby to increase the selection. For international travelers, we realized that location, nearby transit points, and closeness to tourist spots are the most critical factors. Hence, we built maps tailor-made for such needs, along with information related to why Indians love certain properties,” he added.

Khanna said homestays and villas is the fastest growing segment and requires different decision-making considerations as compared to hotels.

“We have the rich content information available for over 15,000 properties in India. Customer preferences and selection requirements change depending on who they are traveling with, the destination, purpose, length of stay, etc,” said Khanna. “For example, traveling for work and arriving early in the morning would entail very different needs compared to traveling with your kids.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sustainability/whos-going-to-work-all-those-green-transition-jobs/articleshow/106466193.cms,"Humans can do incredible things. From building train tunnels underneath the sea to enormous offshore wind farms, it’s inspiring what we can achieve with the right skills and money. Keep that in mind, because we need to do many more incredible things in a very short period of time if we want a shot at addressing climate change and crafting a better future for our planet.

When we talk about the great green economic transformation, we often miss a piece of the puzzle: human capacity. Yes, financing renewables is vital but, without training, who’ll be able to make it all work? The transition away from fossil fuels, as agreed at the most recent United Nations COP climate summit, creates opportunities for economic development and job creation. But we mustn’t forget that people need to gain the right skills — from elementary math to specialist technical knowledge — before taking on green roles.

The situation on this front is dire. Roughly 69% of people aged 16-24 globally lack secondary education-level skills. Without those basic literacy and numeracy skills, these people will find it difficult, if not impossible, to play a role in the transition. Basic education is also one of the best ways to create resilience.

This is especially acute in low- and middle-income countries, where young people and women are more likely to be unskilled, unemployed or in unstable work. But it’s an issue everywhere: LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills report found that while green job postings are up by 15% year-on-year, the supply of suitably equipped workers just isn’t there.

This is a justice issue. As skills change, there’s a risk that more people get left behind and without economic opportunities. But it’ll also affect the transition itself. Liesbet Steer, president and chief executive officer of the global nonprofit Education Development Center, pointed out to me that scarce labor drives up cost. Without a plentiful supply of well-trained workers, the transition will not only be slower, but far more expensive.

The backlash against climate policies would likely also be reduced if people understood what it meant for jobs and were able to access those opportunities.

Take Dutch farmers, who have been protesting for months against agricultural reforms that may require them to shut down or reduce the size of their farms. They formed a political party in 2019 to push back against such policies, which are aimed at reducing nitrogen and ammonia pollution. Without retraining — to give them skills to reduce the environmental impact of their farms or to help them change careers — it’s natural they’d feel resentful. What happened in the Netherlands will be a pattern if education and training aren’t tackled as key elements of the transition.

It’d help if people received fundamental climate change information, but that also seems to be behind. A UNESCO analysis of education curricula from 100 countries shows that only 53% make any reference to climate change and, when the subject is mentioned, it is almost always given low priority.

Anna Bagwell, a student leader on the Youth Climate Advocacy Committee run by Phipps Conservatory in Pittsburgh, told me that most students who come through the program report getting their climate knowledge from online sources. It was only in July that the state of Connecticut mandated climate-change studies across its public schools as part of its science curriculum — and it’s one of the only US states to do so.

Steer says that education and training are still seen by the climate sector as someone else’s responsibility rather than an integral part of the solution. While two-thirds of climate action plans laid out by 2015 Paris Agreement signatories recognise the importance of skills development, only 40% have an implementation plan. Even fewer mention climate-change education.

The global stocktake, the landmark deal delivered at COP28, does reflect an increased focus on capacity building. But, as Steer comments, “the devil is in the detail.” Skills development is only mentioned briefly, with no reference to training or education. The tract of negotiations that covers education and training, Action for Climate Empowerment, failed to reach an agreement during the summit, so talks will resume in Bonn next summer.

Meanwhile, the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders published an open letter ahead of COP28. Signed by 108 business leaders from companies including Deutsche Bank AG and Sony Group Corp., it calls for regulatory change and new investment, but says nothing about skills or education. That feels odd considering labor shortages are already being cited as one of the main challenges facing firms in sectors such as construction, manufacturing and technology.

As we move into a new year, there needs to be much greater weight placed on reskilling and upskilling entire labor forces. Political and business leaders ought to work together on providing retraining opportunities for adults in jobs that are being, or will be, disrupted, and they must make sure that information about new opportunities is properly shared throughout communities. For example, EDC research identified more than 270 different occupations in the fastest-growing green and blue sectors in developing countries: renewable energy, green construction, waste management, tourism and hospitality, and sustainable agriculture and forestry. However, in speaking to training providers, local governments and jobseekers, researchers found few were even aware of these opportunities.

And we shouldn’t forget the youngest and most marginalised members of society. The Global Education Monitoring Report estimates that there will be an average annual financing gap of $97 billion between 2023 and 2030 in low- and low-middle income countries for achieving universal pre-primary, primary and secondary education by the dawn of the next decade. This needs to be addressed.

After all, when humans built the pyramids, or the Empire State Building, or any of the other monuments to human capacity, they probably started with the foundations."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/reliance-jio-may-get-approval-to-launch-satcom-services-soon/articleshow/106459270.cms,"Reliance Jio could receive the landing rights and market access authorisations this month from the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe), approvals which are essential for the Mukesh Ambani-led telecom operator to launch its satellite-based gigabit fibre services in India, people aware of the matter said.

Jio has made all necessary submissions to IN-SPACe, the space industry regulator, and the required authorisations are expected soon, one of the people cited earlier told ET. The authorisations are mandatory for deploying global satellite bandwidth capacity in India.

The IN-SPACe authorisation process is a complex one, entailing approvals from several ministries and security clearances.

“We don’t comment on the status of approvals of specific companies…all I can say is that several applications for IN-SPACe authorisations are in the pipeline,” Pawan Goenka, chairman of IN-SPACe, said in response to ET’s query on pending authorisations for Jio’s satcoms venture.

Last year, Jio Platforms and Luxembourg-based satcoms player SES had formed a 51:49 joint venture to deliver broadband connectivity via satellites, entering a space where the likes of Eutelsat OneWeb, Elon Musk’s Starlink, Amazon and the Tatas have also announced their entries.

Jio’s satellite arm has already been issued a GMPCS (global mobile personal communications by satellite services) licence by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) but authorisations from IN-SPACe are pending.

Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb is the only global satellite constellation operator to have received the required approvals from IN-SPACe.

ET’s query to Reliance Jio remained unanswered.

Both Eutelsat OneWeb and the Jio-SES combine are striving for a first-mover’s advantage over the likes of Starlink, Jeff Bezos-led Amazon and Tatas in the still-nascent India satcoms market that has high growth potential. Jio’s president Mathew Oommen had recently said Jio’s satellite services unit can roll out JioSpaceFiber services within weeks of being allotted the spectrum.



With the new Telecommunications Act, 2023 giving legislative backing to the allocation of satellite spectrum via the administrative route, the assignment of such airwaves by DoT is unlikely to take too long, the people cited earlier said.

IN-SPACe recently estimated that India’s space economy has the potential to hit $44 billion by 2033, and account for about 8% of the global share from around 2% now.

Broadband services in India via satellites will primarily be targeted at areas now underserved by traditional terrestrial broadband solutions, including in rural and remote regions with limited or zero access to high-speed internet."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/why-need-for-effective-ip-protection-in-digital-space-is-critical/articleshow/106466178.cms,"To put simply, intellectual property is a creation of the mind — innovations, inventions, literary & artistic works, symbols, names, and designs which can be used in a commercial sense. These rights are vital for fostering innovation and creativity, providing creators with due acknowledgement or authorship, protection or exclusivity and incentives to continue pushing the boundaries of human ingenuity.

In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, the intersection of intellectual property rights (IPRs) and digital innovation has become a focal point. The digital revolution resulting in the ease of access to information has transformed how the content is created, distributed, and consumed. Internet has connected the world like never before due to which, intellectual properties (IPs) such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, have encountered new complexities in the digital sphere when it comes to: novelty, test of human ingenuity and enforcement of IP rights to exclusion of others. Let’s delve briefly on different IPs over digital innovations.

Copyrights, safeguarding original works of authorship (artistic innovation), is one of the prime IPs to face severe challenges due digital replication and distribution. The ease of copying and sharing content online leads to piracy resulting in outright infringements of copyrights which was extensively prevalent during initial years of the internet revolution. The online piracy spans various forms, from unauthorised distribution of movies, music, and software to infringement of literary works and counterfeiting of goods. This rampant practice inflicts substantial economic losses on content creators, artists, and industries, eroding the incentives for innovation and creativity. The rapid proliferation of high-speed internet and digital platforms has inadvertently fuelled the spread of piracy. Peer-to-peer sharing, torrent sites, streaming platforms hosting unauthorised content, and illicit apps have made piracy easily accessible to a wide audience, exacerbating the problem.

Amending and fortifying existing laws to address nuances of digital piracy is imperative. This may include new technologically enabled enforcement mechanisms, introducing stringent penalties, and expediting legal proceedings to combat online piracy effectively. Harnessing technological solutions like content recognition algorithms, digital watermarks, and encryption can act as potent tools in deterring piracy and tracking unauthorised distribution of content. Collaboration between stakeholders and government/enforcement bodies, content creators, internet service providers (ISPs), and technology firms is crucial to tackle piracy. Joint efforts to raise awareness among the public about the perils of piracy and promoting legal alternatives can significantly curb illicit practices. Continuous efforts like Digital Rights Management (DRM) along with technological advancements of encryption and data protection shall be adopted to strike a balance between access and protection of online proprietary subject matter.

Patents, giving protection & encouragement to “technical innovations”, witnessed an overwhelming increasing number of digital-based inventions in last couple of decades. From computer related inventions to software enabled inventions, moving onto now artificial intelligence, the boundaries of patentable subject matter continue to expand in respective jurisdictions around the world. The law makers are trying to cope up with the fast paced evolution of digital innovations. While endeavouring to include computer enabled technical innovations under patents, the patent system at the same time face criticism over ‘patent trolls’ and the patenting of trivial or overly broad inventions, thereby hindering rather than fostering innovation. The debate over the crucial and difficult to achieve balance between exclusivity against free-access is an ongoing one.

Trademarks, being crucial in terms of brand identity and consumer protection, face challenges like domain squatting, counterfeit goods or service or promotion thereof on new age digital-media platforms, emergence of brand dynamics and associations in social media and digital space overall. Balancing protection of established brands with the rights of newcomers in the digital space remains a significant task for all brand owners and tedious task to traceback and put accountability on the infringing or involved parties, which at times seems next to impossible.

The balancing act between Innovation and Access:
Digital revolution has sparked fresh debates about striking a balance between fostering innovation through IPRs and ensuring access to information and knowledge for societal development. Open-source movements, Creative Commons licenses, and initiatives promoting fair use seek to mitigate the exclusivity of IPRs, allowing for collaboration and widespread dissemination of knowledge.

The open-source model champions transparency and collaboration, allowing for collective contributions to software, research, and innovation. Projects like Linux, Wikipedia, and countless others showcase the power of communal development and the dissemination of knowledge without traditional IP restrictions. Creative Commons licenses offer a middle ground between strict copyright and full openness. These licenses permit creators to specify the ways others can use their work, fostering a balance between protecting their creations and allowing for broader access and reuse.

The said debates surrounding IPRs in the digital age extend beyond legal and economic realms, touching upon ethical considerations. Striking a balance between rewarding creators and ensuring access to essential knowledge for societal progress remains an ethical challenge as well.

Global Perspectives and Policy Implications: IPRs are subject to varying legal frameworks and enforcement mechanisms worldwide. Globalization and digital interconnectedness have prompted discussions on harmonising intellectual property laws across borders. International agreements like the TRIPS Agreement aim to standardise IP protections, yet challenges remain in balancing the needs of diverse economies and cultures. Enforcing intellectual property rights in the digital realm poses another set of unique challenges, including jurisdictional issues, difficulties in tracking online infringement, and the emergence of anonymising technologies. Policymakers grapple with adapting legal frameworks to effectively address these challenges while safeguarding innovation.

The Future of Intellectual Property and Digital Innovation: The future landscape of intellectual property in the digital age will likely continue to evolve. Emerging technologies like blockchain, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things will reshape how intellectual property is created, protected, and managed. Collaborative efforts between law makers, courts, industry leaders, and innovators will be pivotal in adapting IPR frameworks to these changes.

To conclude, IPRs are admittedly the cornerstone for progression of this new age world, be it innovation, incentivising creativity and protecting the fruits of human intellect. In this digital era, IP rights face unprecedented challenges and opportunities, demanding a delicate balance between fostering innovation, protecting creators, and ensuring access to knowledge. The dynamic interplay between IPRs and digital innovation will continue to shape our technological landscape, influencing the way we create, share, and benefit from human ingenuity. Balancing these interests will remain a defining challenge as society navigates the exciting yet complex digital future.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/vedanta-faces-investor-reckoning-over-3-2-billion-of-bonds/articleshow/106465115.cms,"Vedanta Resources Ltd. faces a moment of reckoning this week as Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal’s miner seeks approval for a proposal that could help it buy more time to honor its debt liabilities.

Bondholders have until Jan. 2 to give an early consent on a plan to push out due dates on $3.2 billion in bond repayments, a move that prompted S&P Global Ratings in December to cut the company’s rating deeper into junk.

Vedanta needs a green light from at least two-thirds of the bondholders in each of the three securities to proceed with the plan. A holder meeting will be held on Jan. 4.

The bid to revise the terms of its dollar bonds marks the latest attempt by Agarwal’s group to bolster its balance sheet, having already sold a stake in its Mumbai-listed subsidiary and secured a $1.25 billion private loan. But the fact Vedanta borrowed money at 18% to refinance debt underscores concerns about its finances.

What is Vedanta’s latest proposal to cut its debt load?
The miner is offering to pay $779 million by early February for notes due this year and 2025, and plans to extend the maturity on the remaining principal by as many as four years.

The following is the consent exercise structure published on Vedanta’s website.

There is no proposed change to the principal amount or the coupon on notes due in April 2026. The miner is seeking approval to revise the fixed charge coverage ratio, a leverage covenant.

What are S&P Global and bondholders saying?
S&P cut Vedanta Resources’ rating to to CC from CCC, saying the move will likely result in a downgrade to selective default. Still, it expects “good earnings and strong cash flows” at the group as commodity prices improve and its Indian units send back $400 million-$500 million in dividends each year — a key source of funds for the UK-based parent.

A group of adhoc holders of the company’s guaranteed notes have said that the firm didn’t include any feedback from them, and therefore the proposal doesn’t represent the best terms possible for the notes. Vedanta responded saying that it has engaged with many noteholders before arriving at the plan.

The miner also extended consent deadline for all the three dollar bonds by a few days to accommodate feedback from bondholders who were facing operational challenges amid year-end holidays.

What should bondholders do?
Research firm CreditSights recommends bondholders give their consents for the amendments because the revised terms are more attractive.

But S&P Global is skeptical.

That’s because Vedanta hasn’t provided adequate compensation for the extension of maturities, the ratings assessor said. The company is also prioritizing cash flows and proceeds from asset sales to meet obligations from the $1.25 billion credit facility over the other creditors, S&P added.

If Vedanta fails to get the required support, the focus will shift to the company’s ability to honor its $1 billion bond due Jan. 21.

How are Vedanta’s dollar bonds faring?

Bloomberg

The dollar notes due this month were the most supportive of the firm’s liability management exercise, while the remaining three trade below the 80 cents on the dollar mark often considered indicative of distress.

Still, the bond due in August 2024 rose 3.5 cents on the dollar in December to 66.4 cents, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That’s the biggest monthly gain since September. Those on March 2025 notes advanced 3.1 cents to 74.4 cents.

How did the company become such a big player?
Agarwal, who was raised in the Indian state of Bihar, took over his father’s business making aluminum conductors in the 1970s, and then branched into trading scrap metal.

He built Vedanta Ltd. through a series of ambitious acquisitions: In 2001, Agarwal bought a controlling stake in then government-owned Bharat Aluminium Co. and he followed that up with the purchase of another state-run firm, Hindustan Zinc. He successfully bid for iron ore producer Sesa Goa Ltd. in 2007 and for Cairn India. Vedanta Resources also owns copper and zinc operations in Africa.

The company was the first in India to list in London back in 2003, before Agarwal took it private 15 years later when his Vedanta Inc. bought out minority investors as part of efforts to streamline the group’s structure. Agarwal has renamed Volcan Investments Ltd. to Vedanta Inc.

It is this acquisition spree that caused the conglomerate’s debt to balloon.

What are the next milestones?

In an interview with ETMarkets, Murugan said: “We expect the domestic markets to be volatile in 2024 and advise retail investors to focus on diversifying their portfolio across sectors and accumulate stocks in the mid to large-cap space which has strong fundamentals and avoid high-debt companies,” Edited excerpts:


Looking at the SIP book which has grown consistently in the calendar year 2023 and has reached an all-time high of Rs 17,000 crores in November shows the strength and depth of the .

Regular and consistent SIPs will enable retail investors to benefit from economic growth and will act as the best strategy for accumulating wealth in the long term.

As India moves towards the third largest economy, the retail investors should stick to their SIPs for a longer period above 5 to 7 years to build wealth.

Investors should diversify their investments as it can reduce the overall risk of their portfolio and enhance their returns.


The rally in the Indian is fuelled by key factors such as the robust domestic investment flows, which was also supported by strong inflow from FII's in November and December as the U.S. 10-year bond yield declined.

A decline in the crude oil prices is also supportive. The market believes that multiple rate cuts are in store for 2024 by the US FED and finally the market had a boost from RBI's hike in GDP growth estimates to 7% for FY24.

The aggregate earnings of India Inc., during the July to September quarter which have increased more than 30% also supported the sentiment.

India is expected to overtake Japan's nominal GDP in US dollars by 2027 and become the top three of the globe’s largest economies. The foreign broking firm CLSA also expects India's GDP growth to surpass Japan by 2027.


In 2023, the Indian Stock Markets achieved a significant milestone, with the Nifty surpassing the 21,000 mark in December and inching towards 22000 in January 2024, marking a notable development.

As we move forward into 2024, it is anticipated that the Indian Stock market will demonstrate resilience, potentially outshining its global counterparts.

This optimistic outlook is grounded in the improving global and domestic landscapes, coupled with favorable elements such as softened inflation, an early adjustment in monetary policy rates, and reduced crude oil prices.

The first half of 2024 may witness positive market dynamics, yet it's important to note that our perspective is not exclusively to any specific electoral events.

Our bullish outlook for the year ahead is primarily underpinned by the ongoing investment cycle and the resurgence in manufacturing.


Mainboard IPOs are for large corporations with a post-issue paid-up capital of INR 10 crores and above and the SME IPOs are meant for small and medium-sized entities.

SME IPO investing is different from the mainboard IPO as SME IPO investing requires large sums of money over Rs. 1,00,000 which is quite high when compared to Rs. 14,000-15,000 for mainboard IPOs.

SME IPO has low liquidity post-listing and is only meant for investors with a high-risk appetite.

Retail investors should look at the company’s business model, future growth potential, promoter’s shareholding, historical performance, and objects of the offer and check the valuation of the stock through peer analysis before investing in an SME IPO.


As the expectations are high on interest rate cuts globally in 2024 the outcome can lead to the inflows from the FIIs going ahead.

The sectors like manufacturing, IT, Banking, AMC, automobiles, insurance, and real estate are the major beneficiaries. The few other sectors likely to benefit are Defence, Railway Infra, and Digital Transformation.

We expect the domestic markets to be volatile in 2024 and advise retail investors to focus on diversifying their portfolio across sectors and accumulate stocks in the mid to large-cap space which has strong fundamentals and avoid high-debt companies."

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/foreign-militants-outnumber-local-terrorists-in-jk/articleshow/106459333.cms,"For the first time in Jammu and Kashmir, more foreign militants were killed than local terrorists. Out of 72 terrorists killed by security forces in 2023, 50 were of foreign origin, officials said on Monday.

As per an assessment carried out by central agencies, 91 militants (61 of them being foreigners) are still active in J&K including the Rajouri-Poonch region, which remains a challenge for the security forces, said officials citing government data.

Union home minister Amit Shah is set to review J&K's overall security situation, including the recent incident in which Army personnel were ambushed in the Rajouri-Poonch region, they said. In 2022, 187 terrorists were killed by the security forces and 57 of them were of foreign origin, largely Pakistanis.

""There has been a sharp decline in the number of incidents in the Valley as compared to past years,"" said a senior official, adding that the Rajouri-Poonch region in Jammu is a new challenge for the security forces.

Last year on January 1 and 2, seven civilians were killed and 12 others injured in terror attacks in Rajouri. In April, an IED was used to kill five Army soldiers in Poonch. Jaish-e-Mohammad-affiliated People's Anti-Fascist Front had claimed responsibility for the attacks. In May, five soldiers were killed and another was injured in a gunfight with militants in the jungles of Rajouri-Poonch during a combing operation.

In November, five soldiers, including two Army captains, were killed in a two-day anti-terrorist operation in Rajouri. In December, militants killed four Army personnel and reportedly mutilated the bodies of at least two soldiers. The counteraction by security forces, however, led to the death of three civilians and injuries to others. Besides local police, the national and state agencies have intensified anti-terror operations across J&K to break the terror ecosystems.

The 75-year-old writer, in his new blog post, shared his love for Netflix's animated series 'Blue Eye Samurai' and then pivoted to share updates on the new shows.

""As it happens, HBO and I have our own animated projects, set in the world of A SONG OF ICE & FIRE. None of them have been greenlit yet, but I think we are getting close to taking the next step with a couple of them,"" Martin shared, adding they began with four ideas for an animated show but two of them currently stand shelved.

He, however, hoped that the projects would find a life as ""nothing is ever dead for good in Hollywood"".

The storyline for the two spin-off projects is still under wraps

Talking about the third show in the development, Martin wrote, ""Work on the other two animated projects continues apace, however... and meanwhile, we have moved NINE VOYAGES, our series about the legendary voyages of the Sea Snake, over from live-action to animation. A move I support fully.""

The writer said ""budgetary constraints"" would likely have made a live-action version expensive as half of the show is set at sea.

""So we now have three animated projects underway...Will any of them make it to air? happen? No way to know. Nothing is certain in Hollywood. But if it does happen, with one or two or all three shows, I hope we can make them as good as gorgeous and gripping as BLUE EYE SAMURAI. We will for d*** sure try,"" the famous writer said.

Last week, the 52-year-old actor hinted at his return to the show after he shared an Instagram Story with his co-star Emma Laird.

As he continues to recover, Renner spoke with Andy Cohen and Anderson Cooper during their CNN New Year's Eve special.

""It's been a wonderfully busy year. I think I'm ready and I think I'm strong enough. I literally go back in a week,"" he said about going back to work on the third season of 'Mayor of Kingstown'.

The Marvel star also said he had a lot to celebrate this year.

""I'm so blessed that I had so many things to live for. I have a giant family, a 10-year-old daughter. I would have disappointed and messed up a lot of people's lives if I passed. There's a lot for me to fight for. Recovery is a one-way road in my mind. I still work hard every day,"" he added.

Renner had suffered an accident in January after a snow plough ran him over as he was trying to save his nephew from getting run over himself. Renner broke over 30 bones in the accident, which required major rehabilitation.

'Mayor of Kingstown' follows the McLusky family, power brokers in Kingstown, Michigan, where the business of incarceration is the only thriving industry. In the Paramount+ series, Renner plays Mike McLusky, who acts as a liaison between criminals, prison guards, and police.

And that is what we look at.”

There are three moving parts which I can see and you can add maybe four or five if you want to this list and the list is next year what China will do, will Fed cut rates and the impact of election volatility. These are three big moving parts which could be binary in nature. How do you view these moving parts for next year? What could be the biggest moving part?
S Naren: China is one of the cheapest markets in the world but no one is able to understand China. I mean I thought it was cheap and it deserved a contrarian position but it turned out to be wrong because no one can understand China. If anyone visits China and comes back, they come back depressed. So, maybe we have to accept that it is impossible to understand China because it is not a capitalistic society and it is run in a very different way from a democracy like India. So maybe that is where it is.

As far as the Fed is concerned, we have to remember that as far as inflation is concerned, we seem to have clearly seen the peak and it is coming down. But there are other things we have to remember that you know if you look at the US as a country, the fiscal deficit has just shot up through the roof and despite huge oil production, the current account deficit is not coming down. So I am not able to understand how you can have such a high fiscal deficit in the most advanced economy in the world and the fiscal deficit is not at all low.

When you have such a high fiscal deficit and such a high current account deficit, will the central bank only look at inflation coming down and not bother about anything else because they have to fund their fiscal deficit as well and this is something that we think about but that is not a emerging market central bank, that is the central bank of the reserve currency of the world. So maybe we will have to think differently and that is where we are looking at.

There are 40 elections next year.
S Naren: Yes, election will be a source of volatility and in some other countries, people may get it wrong and that will be a source of volatility and that cannot be helped actually because as we have seen repeatedly over the years, people think that the financial centres people can predict elections actually and financial markets can understand elections.

How much of the 2023 frenzy is likely to extend to 2024? S Naren answers

Financial centres people have no knowledge of political matters, they do not even get markets right. Many of the times where they get politics right, they look at the market. So they can possibly understand valuations, sentiment and maybe they can understand cycles but getting market trends right always and getting political trends right always is impossible and as you know, we never expected the Ukraine war or the Gaza conflict. Sometimes we overrate our ability to understand geopolitical issues, not sometimes always.

My next question is about these popular themes, EV, manufacturing, energy transition. Are you taking a bet in any of the popular themes, EV, manufacturing or energy transition?
S Naren: If you look at EV, we bet normally on the companies which we like and we have it in our own way on some of the EV companies very early on and as usual, I have to thank some of my younger colleagues for thinking of these things at the right time in the right sizing. Those bets have gone off very well for us as a company in the auto side. As investors, that too managing other peoples’ money, we are very conscious that we will not bet on companies which have huge losses.

We love a company where there is a profitable business along with that there is an unprofitable EV business and that unprofitable EV business is also given price to earnings on the loss so that at some point of time, when that EV business turns around, you get a big kicker and that is the framework which we enjoy.

Like for example, we did the same thing in a pharma company where there was a speciality business which was incurring a loss on which multiple was given on the loss made whereas we knew that over a period of time, the speciality business will turn around and that will give a benefit and that framework is what we have used because we have the benefit of patience and we have the benefit of long-term thinking thanks to the investors who give us money for the long term. So with that process, we have actually focused and we have had a good experience in EV. As far as manufacturing sector is concerned, we have had a manufacturing fund and frankly, my colleague who runs the manufacturing fund has been recommending consistently to the distributors to get money there and the fund has actually been scaling up. Having said that, both me and my colleague have the same view that in services, we have leadership which is very easy whereas in manufacturing, the leadership is not straightforward and we have a lot of work to do there.

If you want to capture the Indian opportunity, don’t ignore midcaps: Radhika Gupta

The kind of leadership we have in services, no one can compare with us whereas in manufacturing, every country competes with us and that is why the manufacturing leadership as far as this country goes is not as easy as the services leadership that we have and that is why the sector is already done extremely well and from here on, whatever valuation challenges are there in the rest of the market, apply to this scheme as well at this point. And that is what we look at.

On energy transition, actually, at some point of time, we felt that the transition people were thinking of what was going to happen too fast and we actually bet on the reverse by betting on areas like thermal power and all that and that has worked out. Now, we have to look at it the other way and see whether people are over focused and thinking that energy transition would not happen and we have to now look at it the other way.

So three years back by being contrarian, we benefited. Now, should we be contrarian and think that people have forgotten energy transition worries. But in India, one of my colleagues actually bet on many of the wind energy companies and that turned out to be a very good decision in recent times. But the challenge in energy transition is that wind companies and all that are much smaller and the scale of the money that we manage and the amount of money that can be put into energy transition companies is not tallying with what we can invest as a large AMC. So that is the challenge we are having from an AMC point of view.

The Street is split right in the middle on IT. The AI believers think that this is a disruptive and Indian IT services per se, the model will get changed. The folks who have seen 15-20 years of evolution, are of the view that when Y2K was changing, the same issue was discussed. When the enterprise was discussing, the same issue was discussed but Indian companies have migrated beautifully. What is your view?
S Naren: The Indian IT companies are brilliant. They have very good governance and ability to transform themselves but more than the AI issue, I feel what has happened is India has become such a brilliant services hub that almost everyone has set up a GCC.

Along with the AI risk, our view is that the GCC setting up has also reduced the growth rate of Indian IT and it is not that the Indian IT companies are doing badly. It is just that India has become such a hub that there is no one who does not want to set up a GCC. So it is a combination of GCC plus AI. The AI trend has not yet shown up in our opinion and may show up over the next three to five years.

It is the GCC reducing the growth which has already shown up at this point of time and that is what worries us from a valuation angle, from a company angle, from a governance angle, from the way they have given back money back to the shareholders. We are deeply happy with the Indian IT services company but the growth rate of the Indian IT services companies in the recent past has not been good and not in line with the valuations and that is a function of GCC now.

You follow Howard Marks and you are a practitioner of greed and fear and markets seldom get into this greed zone and seldom get into fear zone. Now there is no fear in the market but there is a lot of greed in the market. So how are you navigating that feature of the market?
S Naren: That is a problem. That is why when we tell people and when we meet people there are asset classes other than equity, you should consider today that new money is hybrid. For example, I am not involved in this business but there are AIFs which are focused on debt. People laugh at us about debt as an asset class and AIF and things like that. I am not involved in that business really. We have a credit fund in the AIF space.

Logically, people should put money in those spaces but people just do not even consider them and I find it absolutely clear that the greed is so high towards equity-oriented products that people are not willing to consider those products at this point of time. I find it really interesting that greed is so much towards equity and we have seen that when you have an asset class which have done well for 10-11 years and like equity from 2013 to 2024, we have seen that in real estate from 2003 to 2002 to 2013.

People think all the other asset classes are not worth it and that is the phase right now in the asset markets today and that is the reason people are not willing to look at other assets. So what we do as an AMC and thanks to the good work done by all the people around me, we focus on hybrid and focus on all the categories in hybrid whether it is multi-asset or equity and debt or balanced advantage or equity savings and my colleagues and I am not involved in that business focus on things like debt AIF.

We say no, we will not give up on the other asset classes and it is a tough task because the unit output that you get for unit input is much lower in these things whereas if you decide that you sell only pure equity, the output will be much higher because the returns are, the output is much higher because people want to invest only in equity at this point in time whereas the people who are saying no no no do not do that there is too much greed in equity, there is too much disinterest in every other asset class so focus on that.

But we will do it because of our learnings and we manage other people's money and by focusing on greed and fear it has helped us over the long periods so we will continue to do this irrespective of the output being lower than the input we will continue to do this.

So correct me if my interpretation is wrong but you are of the view that we are not in the green zone when it comes to buying, we are not in the yellow zone when it comes to fair value, we are perhaps bordering the red line. So if markets go up by another 5%-7% in a hurry, only because of liquidity would you raise the red flag then? Would you okay it is time to take significant amount of profits away from equities?
S Naren: We are closer to that I think you put it correctly but it is a very tough task to come on your channel and give that call but I would say that investors have to practice asset allocation. And I believe that 7% to 10% from here if it happens in the next three to six months, the market should be fully valued or overvalued. That is how it looks at this point of time. It is a very tough task to do that because we know how much momentum goes up in the last phase of the market is impossible for anyone to predict.

In fact, I did a short presentation to my team showing what happened in the last six months of 1999-2000 and what happened in the last six months of 2007-2008 and my colleagues were astounded by the return shown in the last six months of those bull markets. So it is a very tough task but clearly at that point of time, we will not be cheerleaders for the market. Maybe we will hide away in the market and we will not tell people to invest aggressively but that I am very sure about.

But to give a sell call because you looked at the last six months of the 1999-2000 bull market and the last six months of the 2007-2008 bull market, the market just shot up far beyond fair value and that is the challenge but even today we would tell people that if you are investing for the long term and not the short term, you should practice asset allocation."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/study-says-low-cost-plant-compound-may-help-people-quit-smoking/articleshow/106464358.cms,"NEW DELHI: Cytisine, a plant-based compound, increases the chances of successful smoking cessation by over two-fold compared with placebo and may be more effective than nicotine replacement therapy, a study has found. Cytisine, a low-cost, generic stop-smoking aid has been used in eastern Europe since the 1960s and has shown no serious safety concerns, the researchers said.

However, the compound is not licensed or marketed in most countries outside of central and eastern Europe, making it unavailable in most of the world, including many low- and middle-income (LAMI) countries where it could make a big difference to global health.

The study, published in the journal Addiction, pooled the results of eight trials comparing cytisine with placebo, with nearly 6,000 patients.

The combined results showed that cytisine increases the chances of successful smoking cessation by more than two-fold compared with placebo, the researchers said.

They also noted that cytisine may be more effective than nicotine replacement therapy, a medically approved way to treat people with tobacco use disorder by taking nicotine through means other than tobacco.

""Our study adds to the evidence that cytisine is an effective and inexpensive stop-smoking aid. It could be very useful in reducing smoking in LAMI countries where cost-effective smoking cessation drugs are urgently needed,"" said Omar De Santi from Centro Nacional de Intoxicaciones (CNI), Buenos Aires, Argentina.

""World-wide, smoking is considered the main cause of preventable death. Cytisine has the potential to be one of the big answers to that problem,"" said De Santi, lead author of the study.

The research also looked at two randomised controlled trials comparing cytisine with nicotine replacement therapy, with modest results in favor of cytisine, and three trials comparing cytisine with varenicline, without a clear benefit for cytisine.

Cytisine was first synthesised in Bulgaria in 1964 as Tabex and later spread to other countries in eastern Europe and Asia, where it is still marketed, according to the researchers.

In 2017, the Polish pharmaceutical company Aflofarm began selling it as Desmoxan, a prescription-only medicine, and Canada approved it as an over-the-counter natural health product, Cravv, they said.

Because cytisine is a low-cost drug, it could form part of a plan to increase accessibility to drug therapy for smokers, which tends to be limited in LAMI countries, the researchers added."

Experts said the double-digit growth in collections reflected the underlying economic momentum and the monthly moderation was attributable to holidays and the base effect.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sebi-crackdown-reinforces-need-for-registration/articleshow/106462095.cms,"ET Intelligence Group: Those leaning on astrology as a guide to stock market investments might do well to heed recent actions by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).

On November 22, the market regulator penalised and barred P Krishnakumar and Jagadeeshan S for a year for giving illegal investment advisory services and ordered them to refund over ₹30 lakh collected as fees through astrology-based prediction packages sold on the website www.ymforecast.com. The two were found to be acting as investment advisors without being registered as such with Sebi.

Sebi, through its Investment Advisors Regulations, 2013, has made it mandatory for anyone providing investment advice to obtain a certification from the regulator. While the list of qualifications needed is fairly onerous, expertise in astrology doesn't count.

To be sure, there are a few Sebi-registered entities that also offer services based on what's known as financial astrology.

""Sebi's order is a good step and much welcome at a time when there are scores of fake financial astrologers misguiding people through their YouTube channels and resulting in losses,"" said Lucknow-based Indrodeep Banerjee, a Sebi-registered research analyst, who has founded the Institute of Financial Astrology and has written several books on the subject.

In fact, two days after the November-end order, Dehradun-based astrologer Deepanshu Giri posted on X his requirement for a Sebi-registered analyst good at technical analysis and interested in astrology to build a stock investment model based on the discipline. Giri hosts the YouTube channel, Lunar Astro, which has more than 150,000 subscribers. He got over 150 emails in response to his post. He has selected three candidates and is planning to start a company in a few months to advise select high net worth individuals with their stock investments.

A cursory search on X and YouTube throws up several handles and channels that are doling out stock market predictions with several of them expressly mentioning that they are not Sebi registered. And, non-registered entities are careful to say that their advice is not stock specific.

Take for instance astrologer Manish Bhatt, who has over 15,700 followers on X. He makes stock market predictions but has mentioned in his bio handle that he is not Sebi registered.

When contacted, he told ET, ""I provide a general astro view on the overall markets. But the people who give stock advice need to be registered and those who aren't registered should clearly mention it.""

There are several handles on X such as @TechnicalyAstro, @brahmesh, @Darshanj101 and @Astrolog360 that have mentioned that they are not registered with Sebi.

“Broadly, people are allowed to provide advice on general index levels but are prohibited to provide stock-specific advice in lieu of any consideration” said Sandeep Parekh, managing partner, Finsec Law Advisors. “There is no exemption when advice is given for educational purposes.”


Getting Sebi isn’t easy. According to Banerjee, Sebi’s order is unlikely to prompt the existing astrologers to seek Sebi certification.

“This is because most of these self-proclaimed astrologers aren’t capable and qualified enough to seek regulatory certification. Besides, Sebi certification comes with its own share of restrictions – one cannot declare one’s past performance to one’s clients or one cannot trade on one’s own advice,” Banerjee said. “If the astrologers were to follow all these compliances, there would not be much scope left to make the kind of money that they are making currently in a market where there is a huge competition.”

Coimbatore-based financial astrologer K Sureshkumar tried seeking Sebi registration but realised that he didn't have the educational qualifications required.

“I am trying to collaborate with someone who is Sebi-registered. But there are a lot of restrictions, so I have stopped posting on my X handle and YouTube channel for now,” Sureshkumar told ET.

Given the recent Sebi decision, caution seems to be the watchword.

“In the long run, if you want to run the business for the next 10 years and you need your clients to trust you, then you better do things legally and in a systematic manner,” Giri told ET. “I don't want Sebi to come and (ask) me why am I doing this.”

Besides, Giri needs the skills of an analyst for actual stock picking.

“While I can decipher the larger sectoral trend, which stock is best placed in the sector is a job that is done well by an analyst,” he said.

Nagpur-based engineering dropout Harshubh Shah is a financial astrologer and a director in a Sebi-registered research firm Wealth View Analytics. The firm has 1,000-1,500 clients for its investment and trading products that are based on a mix of fundamental analysis, technical analysis and financial astrology principles.

“As a research entity, we use all types of analysis like technical, fundamental and financial astrology as well,” Shah told ET. “We include financial astrology for additional confirmations.”

He’ll abide by any regulatory directives though: “The day Sebi asks us to stop research based on financial astrology, we will stop it,” he said."

IndiaFirst Life Insurance received approval for an initial public offering from the capital markets regulator Sebi in March last year and aims to float the issue by March. The company is meeting investors to gauge the market sentiment.

Life insurers are becoming a hard sell after the withdrawal of several tax benefits and the poor post-listing show by the biggest player, the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation.

The two private sector insurers HDFC Life and SBI Life were listed on the stock exchanges in 2017. State-run LIC was listed in 2022, but the current market price is yet to reach the issue price of ₹949.

IndiaFirst's issue will consist of a fresh equity share offering of ₹500 crore and an offer for sale of up to 1.4 billion equity shares.

ICICI Securities, Jefferies, Ambit, BNP Paribas, HSBC Securities, JM Financial, and BOB Capital are the book-running lead managers.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/saudi-fund-outpaces-gic-with-31-6-billion-splurge/articleshow/106462369.cms,"Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund emerged as the world's most active sovereign investor last year, boosting its deal activity even as most global peers including GIC Pte and Temasek Holdings Pte slashed spending.

PIF, as the Saudi fund is known, deployed $31.6 billion in 2023, according to research consultancy Global SWF. That was higher than the $20.7 billion it invested the previous year, an increase that contrasts with a wider trend - globally state-owned investors deployed $124.7 billion, about a fifth less than the prior year.

The declines were led by GIC, which cut the amount of capital deployed by 46% to $19.9 billion and lost its spot as the world's most active sovereign wealth fund for the first time in six years. Temasek also reduced new investments by 53% to $6.3 billion against a backdrop of volatile markets, which led the two Singapore-based investors to report worsening returns.

Global SWF said much of GIC's decline related to investments across developed markets. Singapore's state investors continued to be active in emerging markets like India, with deals including GIC's $1.4 billion joint venture with Brookfield India REIT and Temasek's increased stake in Manipal Health Enterprises.

""Singaporean investors are being more cautious and we've seen that reflected in the numbers,"" Global SWF said. ""Gulf sovereign wealth funds have increased their domination of the global transaction activity, to the detriment of Singaporean and Canadian funds, and now represent almost 40% of all investment value deployed by sovereign investors.""

Overall, sovereign wealth funds controlled by the hydrocarbon-rich governments of Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia and Qatar took five spots on a list of the top 10 most active funds last year.

That trend could be set to continue. The governments of the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain are set to control about $4.4 trillion in gross foreign assets by the end of 2024, two-thirds of which will likely be managed by sovereign wealth funds, according a report issued by the Institute of International Finance in December.

The region is home to a gamut of sovereign funds, which have become an increasingly prominent source of cash for international deals after a surge in energy prices in 2022 left most Gulf government budgets in surplus."

The number of deals also saw a significant 66% increase, totalling 340 in CY23 compared to 205 in CY22. Notably, block deals took precedence, contributing to the substantial rise by generating over $20 billion through several large deals.

Maintaining its leadership position from CY22, emerged as the frontrunner in the ECM league table in CY23, according to Bloomberg data. The firm secured a noteworthy of 14.5%, with deal values amounting to ₹31,303 crore, compared to the previous year's figure of ₹15,045 crore.

JP Morgan ascended in the league table, progressing from the sixth position to the second, reflecting a significant advancement with a market share of nearly 8%. BofA Securities maintained its third position with a 7.52% market share.

IIFL Finance made substantial strides, securing the fourth position in CY23, a notable climb from its 10th position in CY22. Similarly, JM Financial's rank jumped to 5 from the previous year's rank of 11.

In the latest rankings, three global banks - Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Goldman Sachs - experienced declines in the league table. Morgan Stanley's rank slipped to the sixth position from fifth, reflecting a slight decline. Citi, on the other hand, saw a more significant shift, falling to the eighth position from its previous second position. The dynamics of the league table underscore the evolving positions of these global financial institutions in the market.

The ECM deals include initial public offerings (IPOs), block deals, and qualified institutional placements (QIPs). In CY23, 57 companies raised ₹49,434 crore, while 45 companies raised ₹52,340 crore through QIPs.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/a-home-to-stay-a-car-to-ride-indians-use-savings-to-buy/articleshow/106459300.cms,"The net financial savings of Indian households decreased by as much as six percentage points over the last two years, according to official data, as people used it to acquire real assets such as houses and vehicles. While that has raised indebtedness, economists say people's ability to service debt is high compared with that in several major economies.

Official data on household net financial savings indicates that it fell to 5.1% of GDP in FY23 from 11.5% in 2020-21, well below its long-run annual average of 7.0-7.5%. The fall was driven by a rapid rise in financial liabilities ( - from 3.8% of GDP in FY22 to 5.8% in FY23.

Since a large part of the liabilities was due to funding of physical asset creation - mortgages and vehicles - the overall savings of households may still hold steady with a compositional shift in favour of physical savings, a recent analysis by the Reserve Bank of India said. But comparing data from the Bank for International Settlements and 's own estimates, India's household debt service ratio is one of the lowest compared to many major economies.

India's debt service ratio at 6.7% as of March 2023 is less than the US' 7.8%, Japan's 7.5%, the UK's 8.5%, Canada's 14.3% and South Korea's 14.1%. The ratio measures the proportion of household disposable income required to meet debt obligations.

Historical data show a negative correlation between a three-year periodic change in household debt and the subsequent growth in private final consumption expenditure because of rising debt repayment obligations. Household debt in India is much lower than other emerging economies.
To calculate India's debt service ratio, the RBI considered retail data from a survey of 12 major scheduled commercial banks comprising about 80% of the retail loan portfolio at the system level. The weighted average effective rate of interest stood at 9.7% in March 2023 and the residual maturity of retail loans was 12.7 years on the existing stock of debt.

Accordingly, the debt service ratio of Indian households is estimated at 6.7% at the end of March 2023, edging up from 6.6% in March 2022, but still lower than 6.9% in March 2021.

Despite the recent increase in financial liabilities, India's household debt to GDP remains below the average of 48.3% for emerging market economies even under various stress scenarios of a surge in interest rates from the current estimated 6.7% to 8.5%, or even in an extreme scenario of a 21% drop in income levels, which again impacts levels, a sensitivity analysis by the economists at the Reserve Bank of India indicated in the central bank's latest Financial Stability Report.

The RBI analysis assumes significance against the backdrop of the recent monetary tightening, resulting in rising mortgage rates and tighter lending standards."

Though the valuations of many stocks are at lofty levels, there is scope for some of them to extend gains in 2024.

According to analyst consensus estimates available on Bloomberg, 15 stocks, tracked by over 10 brokerage houses, could return between 17% and 34% in 2024.

Some of them are HG Infra, Data Pattern, Fusion Micro, Ashoka Buildcon, PNC Infra, Gokaldas Exports, Sunteck Realty and EPL. Analysts said many of these stocks are in the infrastructure and construction sectors, which are expected to benefit from the continued government spending on roads and rails.

Shares of HG Infra, an infrastructure company based in Jaipur, are anticipated to generate a return of approximately 34% this year, according to consensus estimates from around 15 analysts. As of September 30, 2023, the company had a robust order book totalling ₹10,678 crore. The central government's orders constitute about 70% of the company's total projects.

Data Pattern, a company benefiting from the ministry of defense doubling its procurement from local vendors, is anticipated to yield a return of 29% this year. The stock witnessed a robust rally of 68% in 2023. As of September 30, the company boasted an order book of ₹1,003 crore, which stands at 2.2 times its FY23 sales.

Fusion MicroFinance is anticipated to yield a return of 28%, as per recommendations from 12 analysts. The optimistic outlook is driven by improving collection trends and reduced stress, which are expected to contribute to further enhancements in the asset quality of the microfinance firm in the coming quarters.

Likewise, Ashoka Buildcon, PNC Infratech, and Gokaldas Exports are anticipated to deliver returns of 25% in 2024."

While an easing interest rate environment is seen propping up prices of the yellow metal, double-digit returns like those in 2022 and 2023 are unlikely, especially at the current levels, they said, advising investors to stagger purchases.

""Whenever interest rates in the US come down, gold prices tend to rally, and some part of this year's rally is already reflecting this,"" said Nilesh Shah, managing director, Kotak Mutual Fund.

Gold prices have gained 12% in 2023 as stress in the banking system and expectations that the US central bank would pivot saw some safe-haven buying at the start of the year.

A sluggish few months in the interim were then followed by fresh momentum in prices amid the US economy seeing a slowdown.

While lower interest rates bring down the attractiveness of asset classes competing with gold, sustained high interest rates in the US can add to the already ballooning debt levels for the country.

""It is highly probable that the Fed will either over tighten or under tighten its policy, keeping gold relevant both from risk mitigating and return enhancing perspectives,"" Chirag Mehta and Ghazal Jain of Quantum AMC said in their outlook for gold.

On the domestic front, general elections scheduled in the first-half of the year are seen driving volatility in equities in the short-term, which could also lead to some buying in gold, said analysts.

Prices of gold surged to a record high of over ₹64,000 per 10 grams in the domestic market earlier this year, before closing at ₹63,189/10 grams on the MCX. Silver, meanwhile, has seen a relative underperformance, largely due to its industrial usage not picking us as expected, in line with the Chinese economy.

""We see gold at ₹66,000-67,000 levels, and for less than a 5% upside, it is not lucrative to buy at the current levels,"" said Navneet Damani, the head of commodities at Motilal Oswal Securities.

Investors can consider switching a part of gold investments to silver, as the latter is likely to outperform this year, he said, expecting prices to rise up to ₹88,000 per kg.

For investment purpose, though, investors must buy both gold and silver through instruments such as ETFs and gold bonds, especially since the premium on purchase of both these assets in the physical form is very high, also when one takes into account the transaction costs, said Shah of Kotak Mutual Fund."

The interest pay-out for FY24 is projected to be Rs 10.80 lakh crore, or about 24% of the budgeted expenditure for the financial year. In the pre-Covid FY20, interest payment at Rs 6.12 lakh crore had accounted for 22.8% of the total expenditure.

""Interest payments are likely to go up by 11-12% in the next fiscal year but it's manageable,"" the official told ET.

Higher interest payments indicate an increase in . The official said Covid shock had bloated the government's overall as it increased the spending pressure.



Also, the Ukraine-Russia conflict and the resultant global commodity price spike inflated the Centre's subsidy bill in FY23, preventing a sharper fiscal correction.

The Centre has pegged its FY24 fiscal deficit at 5.9% and hopes to bring it down to 4.5% by FY26.

Global agencies have flagged India's elevated debt burden. The International Monetary Fund, last month, projected the combined debt of India's states and the Centre to swell to 100% of GDP in a worst-case scenario by FY28 and drop below 70% under favourable circumstances.

The government has allayed fears of debt sustainability and stressed that the debt was predominantly in domestic currency.

Meanwhile, the Centre's net tax kitty is budgeted to climb to Rs 23.31 lakh crore in FY24, against Rs 14.26 lakh crore in FY20, having grown 63.5% in these years. Its expenditure is estimated to swell 67.6% to Rs 45.03 lakh crore in FY24 from Rs 26.86 lakh crore in FY20.

Pronab Sen, former chairman of the National Statistical Commission, said the high interest outgo is an issue but not really a cause for excessive concern yet. ""What is more important is that the government must raise its tax-to-GDP ratio significantly. This will address the issue of interest burden.""

If the government prunes its fiscal deficit to the targeted 4.5% of GDP by FY26, it will also help, he said.

Gross tax-to-GDP ratio has remained in the range of 9.8% to 11.4% over the past 10 years.

Sen said global agencies' concerns about India's debt sustainability may have been exaggerated, more so when the country's external debt makes up for a small portion of its overall liabilities."

Meta Quest 2 and 3 not only deliver captivating VR gaming experiences but also serve as an alternative space for enjoying movies and shows on a grand scale. Embrace cable-free standalone VR, liberating you from the need for a PC or mobile device.

Setting the Stage: Meta Quest's VR Cinema

Navigating Netflix on Quest 2 & 3
Streaming Netflix content onto your Quest 2 & 3 is a breeze. The platform provides a native VR application available for download in the Oculus store. Simply acquire the app, log in, and enter a world of streaming. However, note that content resolution is capped at 480p on Quest 2, 3, and Quest Pro headsets.

Prime Video Quest: A Few Extra Steps
While Amazon offers a free VR app on the Oculus store, some users report functionality issues. An alternative approach involves logging into your Amazon account on a PC or laptop and pairing it with your VR app for seamless content access. Alternatively, you can access Amazon Prime Video through the browser, though the resolution is restricted to 720p.

Disney+ Dilemma: Browser-Based Access

Future Horizons: Native Apps on the Horizon
As technology evolves, the potential for native VR apps from streaming giants like Disney+ grows. While Disney+ currently relies on browser-based access, the success of the Disney Movies VR app hints at future possibilities for an immersive streaming experience directly through a dedicated app.

Best wishes to our scientists at Isro and the entire space fraternity in taking India to unprecedented heights,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a post on microblogging platform X.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/work-demand-under-rural-job-scheme-declines-again-in-december/articleshow/106459434.cms,"Demand for work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) moderated for a second straight month in December from a year before, official data showed, reflecting the impact of improved economic activities.

The preliminary data compiled by the rural development ministry showed 24.08 million individuals opted for work under the MGNREGS in December, down 7.1% from a year before. Data for the last two months of 2023 - demand fell 6.9% in November - show a dramatic reversal from a 17.6% jump in October.

Most of the demand came from Tamil Nadu (3.35 million), Rajasthan (2.60 million), Madhya Pradesh (2.38 million), Uttar Pradesh (2.34 million) and Bihar (1.59 million).

The individuals who sought work in December represented 19.97 million households, down 5.7% from 21.18 million households a year earlier.


Demand for jobs under the scheme typically falls when economic activity improves and open up in sectors like agriculture and industry.

The moderation in job demand will partly reduce the pressure on the government to pump in funds to meet the enhanced spending requirements under the scheme, after the budgetary outlay of ₹60,000 crore for fiscal 2024 was exhausted by November itself.

The government subsequently provided ₹10,000 crore in urgent assistance to meet demand. It provided ₹14,524 crore for the scheme in the first batch of supplementary demand for grants for FY24, which included the urgent aid. The data typically gets revised when updated information comes in. The finance ministry last week said the economy will ""comfortably"" surpass its earlier target of 6.5% growth in FY24, as it expected the robust economic activity in the third quarter of FY24 to continue through the March quarter as well.

To be sure, sequentially, a larger number of individuals and households demanded work under the scheme in December: up 15% and 13%, respectively, from November.

Despite the latest drop on a year-on-year basis, work demand from individuals under the NREGS rose 3.3% this fiscal year until December from a year before to 259.51 million, thanks to elevated demand between July and October. The demand came from 206.63 million households from April through December, recording a 6.4% increase from a year earlier.

After registering a marginal decline in the fiscal first quarter, work demand from individuals rose at a faster pace between July and October. This was mainly due to an erratic monsoon that prevented the usual large-scale migration of workers to farming and a tentative industrial recovery, experts have said."

In the last few days, the price has dropped around 20% to Rs 1,500 per quintal from Rs 1,870 as arrivals increased. Since the ban was imposed on exports, the price has dropped 60% in the main wholesale market of Lasalgaon in Maharashtra, said traders in the area. The arrival of fresh kharif onions has increased to 15,000 quintals a day.

The kharif produce has ashorter shelf life than the rabi crop. “We don’t want the prices to drop too much either,” the official said.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/study/financing-your-study-in-the-us-five-quick-tips-for-students/articleshow/106474550.cms,"The United States has always been the first choice for educational and cultural resources for students, which attracts them from all over the world. Even if there is no denying the allure of international colleges and commercial success, the expense of higher education in the US is a cause of concern. However prospective students need not worry because there are many financial aid and financing options available to help manage these costs.

The United States government supports international students by providing different financial services including grants, scholarships, and loans. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for Fall 2024 and U.S. Federal Student Aid are the sources for these materials. There are several criteria, including enrollment, academic accomplishment, and financial need, that determine a student's eligibility for financial aid.

It is crucial to keep in mind that the financial aid awarded should only be spent on educational endeavors. To assist students in locating financial aid and scholarships, the organization also frequently conducts webinars, seminars, and workshops. To enhance their learning, students should prioritize learning about virtual and real-life activities and build the knowledge they need to enhance their learning and knowledge about money.

Exploring Scholarship Opportunities: Unlike loans, students do not have to repay scholarships, making them an effective form of financial support. There are many scholarships available specifically for international students, often supported by universities, foundations, or private organizations. These scholarships may be merit-based, take into account academic achievement or special skills or needs, and may emphasize students with financial constraints.

Grants from Own Country: Many countries provide special grants to their citizens to study abroad. These opportunities can provide significant financial support and those interested should investigate them thoroughly. Student Loans: Student loans can be a useful financial tool that allows students to continue their education without paying any fees. For students pursuing financial aid, student loans may be a significant source of finance for their higher education. It's important to thoroughly analyze the terms and conditions of each loan type to make sure the one selected fits your demands and situation.

Balancing Education and Earning Opportunities: Working part-time under the Federal Work-Study Programme (FWSP) is an excellent option for students to earn money and lower their tuition costs. FWSP provides eligibility to students in school or a school work program, allowing them to manage their finances without relying on scholarships, grants, or student loans. Balancing part-time work with education requires careful planning and discipline. Students who prioritize their education, manage their time, and maintain a healthy work-life balance can successfully manage both properly.

Save money while you study: A budget-friendly lifestyle can help you reduce the cost of living, which includes sharing a home, using public transport, cooking at home, and finding affordable entertainment.

Although attending college in the US may appear like an expense to overseas students, it is feasible with the right preparation and utilization of the options offered. The expedition will be more fruitful if you use the resources.

A bench comprising Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud and justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra took note of the submissions of senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for the Vedanta group firm, that the matter needed to be heard.

The senior lawyer said the matter is listed on January 22 and urged the bench that the matter be heard.

The CJI said the counsel for the parties will be informed after he ascertains during the day as to whether any constitution bench matters are listed for hearing.

Earlier, the top court had said it has directed the registrar to allocate ""two dedicated dates"" for hearing the Vedanta group's plea.

The top court had in May last year asked the Tamil Nadu government to take appropriate decisions in pursuance of its April 10 direction by which it had allowed the Vedanta group to carry out the upkeep of its Sterlite copper unit in Tuticorin under the supervision of a local-level monitoring committee.

In its April 10, 2023 order, the top court had also allowed the evacuation of the remaining gypsum at the plant and made available the required manpower as requested by the company.

It had noted that the district collector had not recommended activities like undertaking a civil and structural safety integrity assessment study in the plant premises, removal and transportation of spares and equipment and evacuation of in-process reverts and other raw materials lying idle.

""As regards the actions which were not recommended by the district collector, C S Vaidyanathan, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Tamil Nadu, states that the state government will once again evaluate whether any further or supplementary directions should be issued in that regard,"" the top court had noted in its April 10 order.

During the earlier hearing, the counsel for Tamil Nadu had said steps have already been taken for implementing the directions contained in one of the paragraphs of the April 10 order which stated that ""as regards those actions which have been permitted to be carried out by the communication dated March 6, 2023, we allow necessary consequential steps to be taken"".

""We direct that all decisions which are required to be taken in pursuance of the observations contained in paragraphs four and five of the order dated April 10, 2023, shall be taken by the state of Tamil Nadu on or before June 1, 2023,"" the bench had said.

The apex court had then listed the plea for final disposal on August 22 and 23, last year.

At least 13 people were killed and many injured on May 22, 2018, when police opened fire on a huge crowd of people protesting against pollution allegedly caused by the copper smelting unit.

The Tamil Nadu government had on May 28, 2018, ordered the state pollution control board to seal and ""permanently"" close the mining group's plant following violent protests over pollution concerns.

As per industry estimates, about 4.1 million passenger vehicles were sold in the local market in the last calendar year, an increase of around 8.2% compared with sales of 3.79 million units in 2022.

Last month, carmakers reported a 4.4% rise in dispatches from factories at 287,904 units, the highest on record for December. Retail sales were substantially higher at 442,800 units, according to industry estimates, helping bring stocks down. The industry started the new year with an inventory of 176,500 units.

Shashank Srivastava, senior executive officer (marketing and sales) at market leader , said 2023 was a ""phenomenal year"" for the industry with sales breaking previous records every month through December. ""Sales were driven by a strong increase in demand for SUVs, which now account for nearly half of all vehicles sold in the domestic market,"" Srivastava said.



Maruti Suzuki - which registered cumulative sales (domestic and exports) of more than 2 million units for the first time in 2023 - has a share of over 20% in the SUV segment.

The company's sales declined by 6.9% to 104,778 units in December, when it undertook an annual maintenance shutdown. For the year, sales rose 9% and the Suzuki Motor unit ended the year with a market share of about 42%.

Tarun Garg, COO at rival Hyundai Motor India, expects the strong traction for SUVs in the local market to help increase its share in overall sales in the upcoming year. ""We expect SUVs to contribute 52-53% to overall volumes this year. At Hyundai, the share of SUVs in overall sales will be higher at about 65%,"" he added.

Hyundai Motor India reported 9% growth in 2023, selling 602,011 units - a record for the company."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/modi-juggernaut-places-bjp-in-prime-position-ahead-of-lok-sabha-polls/articleshow/106459145.cms,"The decade-long reign of the Narendra Modi government has propelled BJP from its northern base to the once forbidden south and from its western citadels to the much-wanted east. PM Modi's ever-growing popularity has been manifested in every election, making him emerge stronger. BJP's biggest achievement in the past 10 years is the fact that it has mastered the art and skill to tide over the much-dreaded anti-incumbency tests. Rather, a pro-incumbency mood, as BJP leaders claim, is visible as the party pads up for the Lok Sabha polls, where it is aiming to better its record of 303 seats it won in 2019. Poll campaign, structured around the achievements of 10 years of the Modi government, and outreach has already started. Compared to the Opposition INDIA bloc, where things are moving at a slow pace and the agenda yet to be clarified, BJP has almost sealed the deal with its partners. This puts BJP in an advantageous position ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.
Brand Modi
In 2014, the slogan for BJP was 'Abki Bar Modi Sarkar'. In 2019, it was 'Modi Hai to Mumkin Hai' and 'Ek Bar Fir Modi Sarkar'. In 2024, it has been changed to 'Modi Ki Guarantee' and 'Fir Ayega Modi'. Brand Modi has delivered several states and two general elections to BJP. Modi has always taken the onus of elections and asked for a mandate on his image and name. His brand image has been stamped on every section of society through government schemes and party outreach programmes. The 2024 general elections are also in a way 'Modi ka Chunav', as he is at the forefront of governance and the party's campaign drive. BJP slogan 'Sapna Nahin Haqiqat Bunte Hain, Tabhi to Hum Modi Ko Chunte Hain', states the significance of the trust factor of Narendra Modi.

""When PM Modi says it is 'Modi Ki Guarantee', it creates a different level of trust among people. He has a track record of delivery and that ensures people that if he makes a commitment, he will fulfil it,"" BJP general secretary Tarun Chug told ET.
Addressing the core
BJP is the only party in the last 10 years, which has been able to keep its core voters intact, expand the core and add new voter class. In 2014, it got 31% vote and 282 seats. In 2019, the vote share increased to 37% and 303 Lok Sabha seats. The party has now set a target of 50% vote share for 2024. In this journey, BJP's core voters, who vote for the party because of their ideological commitment, have played a significant role. From abrogation of Article 370, renovation of the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi, Mahakal Lok in Ujjain to building the Ram temple in Ayodhya, the Modi government has delivered on BJP's core agenda and that of its political ideologue RSS.

BJP cadre and core voters are high on the Ram temple euphoria, which is being whipped up prior to the temple's inauguration on January 22. Kalash Yatra is being organised in every district of the country with pujit akshat (blessed rice). A picture of the Ram temple is being sent to almost 17 crore families across the country as invites to visit the Ram temple after the inauguration. BJP and RSS have been busy with the arrangements to take people to Ayodhya from all the states. The party is planning to keep the temple momentum high till the announcement of the Lok Sabha elections. This will set the tone for BJP in the heartland where the party wants to improve its tally.

Development agenda
The party has been getting additional votes on its development agenda. This vote largely consists of urban voters and youth among villages who are convinced about India's growth story under Modi. It is this class which gives the loudest cheer for PM Modi's $ 5 trillion economy and transformation of India from a developing to a developed nation dream. Urban voters have more or less been with BJP for the past two decades. BJP has put in a lot of effort to bring India's youth population closer to the party narrative with Modi as the face of reforms. Slogans like 'Reform, Perform and Transform' and 'Make in India' given by Modi are a huge hit among the young voters. Catching the youth imagination has been paying dividends to the party in the form of several election wins.

The 2024 election is one where BJP has set its eyes on maximising its youth engagement and converting it into votes. For BJP to get 50% votes, the development agenda voters are extremely important. Events like G-20 and Chandrayan have generated confidence among the aspirational voter class. The government has been focusing on skill development under the newly launched Vishwakarma scheme to target the youth from the lower income and poor families. Ahead of polls, top BJP leaders are going to participate in several closed-door meetings with influential people of society in different cities. Through the 'Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra', the government is inviting youths to be brand ambassadors of a developed India. All this will culminate in a strong vote bank for the party in 2024.

The beneficiary
In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won a large segment of votes from the lower classes through the implementation of several central government schemes. Called labharthis, the government puts this number at 80 crore who are the beneficiaries of one or more of the Modi government's centrally sponsored schemes. This has become a strong vote bank for the party over the years cutting across caste lines. BJP continues to strengthen this vote bank in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls. Around 300 call centres have already been established, mostly in district BJP offices across the country. Through these call centres, the party will establish a connect with the labharthis. Through the ongoing Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra, the government aims to add five to seven crore new beneficiaries by cross selling of schemes.

Reaching out to unreachable
When BJP came to power at the Centre in 2014, the then party president Amit Shah started working on adding new caste groups, which may not be numerically significant in states but together will hold considerable strength in terms of votes. A new social engineering was started by Shah where not-so-dominant castes were given preference in states which has witnessed the rise of certain ruling castes. Smaller caste-based regional parties were made partners to enhance BJP's presence and acceptability among these castes. In UP, for example, it was the consolidation of non-Yadav OBCs, non-Jatav SCs and EBCs in favour of BJP. In Haryana, it worked out as non-Jat OBCs and urban voters. In the last five years, BJP has also worked among the ST voters with its community-specific programmes and by giving importance to tribal leadership. All this has been reflected in BJP's performance during the state elections from UP and West Bengal to Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Gujarat. Till now, the party has successfully thwarted the Opposition's caste census bid with its 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' slogan. In the run-up to the 2024 elections, BJP has mobilised party leaders and cadres to conduct caste and group-specific meetings at the assembly constituency level. It also plans to carry out recruitment drives with a special focus on making influential leaders or those belonging to key castes from the south and east to join the party.
Roadblocks
While BJP has consolidated its position in the north, north-east and the central region, the realignment of political equations in several states and strengthening of Congress down south have emerged as a challenge for the party for the 2024 polls.

Southern setback
The battle south of the Vindhyas has always been challenging for BJP. The party did its best performance in 2019 by winning 29 out of 130 Lok Sabha seats on offer from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. Of these, 25 were from Karnataka and four from Telangana. BJP lost the assembly election in Karnataka earlier this year to Congress. Congress got a further boost in the south by winning Telangana - capturing power in two big south states. This has made Congress a challenger to BJP in terms of Lok Sabha seats. In Karnataka, BJP is aligning with JDS for better electoral performance. While the performance in the assembly election has been discouraging, BJP leaders feel that the Lok Sabha polls will be a different ball game with the Modi factor being projected. In Telangana, Union home minister Amit Shah has set a target of winning 10 Lok Sabha seats out of 17. In Tamil Nadu, BJP is working on a reunion of the two factions of AIADMK and is planning to go into an alliance with the party. In Andhra Pradesh, it has an alliance with Jana Sena of Pawan Kalyan. Top BJP leaders are paying special attention to the south as the party wants to retain its earlier tally. PM Modi's first visit in the new year would be to Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Kerala on January 3 and 4.

Maharashtra
BJP is in power in the state in alliance with factions of the Shiv Sena and NCP. In 2019, BJP won 23 seats and its ally Shiv Sena won 18 seats taking the total NDA tally to 41. In 2024, BJP will contest more seats than the 25 it contested in 2019 and adjust the two allies in the remaining seats. The issue of Maratha reservation has been troubling the state government in the recent past.

West Bengal and Bihar
The BJP leadership is working hard to retain its tally in West Bengal and Bihar. Shah recently visited Bengal and set a target of winning 35 seats in the state. However, several state leaders went back to AITC after the 2021 assembly elections. In Bihar, post the departure of Nitish Kumar's JDU from NDA, the challenge for BJP is to prevent the consolidation of backward caste votes towards the ruling alliance.

Earlier in April 2023, power consumption had dipped nearly 1.5 per cent to 130.08 BU compared to 132.02 BU in the year-ago period. In December 2022, power consumption stood at 121.91 BU, higher than 109.17 BU recorded in the same month a year ago, the data showed.

The peak power demand met -- the highest supply in a day -- rose to 213.62 GW in December. The peak power supply stood at 205.10 GW in December 2022 and 189.24 GW in December 2021.

Experts said that power consumption as well as demand remained lower due to mild winters in the first fortnight of December. However, consumption and demand rose after mercury dipped sharply in the second half of the month, especially in North India.

The data showed that peak power demand touched 213.62 GW on December 29. It was recorded as low as 174.16 GW on December 3. It crossed the 200 GW mark on December 14, 2023, when it stood at 200.56 GW.

The power ministry had estimated the country's electricity demand to touch 229 GW during the summer. The demand did not reach the projected level in April-July due to unseasonal rains.

The peak supply, however, touched a new high of 224.1 GW in June before dropping to 209.03 GW in July. Peak demand touched 238.82 GW in August. In September 2023, it was 243.27 GW. The peak demand was 222.16 GW in October and 204.86 GW in November 2023.

Industry experts said power consumption was affected in March, April, May, and June this year due to widespread rainfall. They said power consumption grew in August, September, and October, mainly due to humid weather conditions, and also a pick up in industrial activities ahead of the festive season.

Experts are expecting steady power consumption growth in the coming months due to an improvement in economic activities and an increase in the severity of winter.

The 37-year-old, a crucial part of the Australia team that clinched their sixth 50-overs World Cup title in India last year, will cap his career with the 112th and final test against Pakistan at his home ground, the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG), beginning on Wednesday.

Having made his debut in January 2009, Warner accumulated 22 centuries and 6,932 runs at an average of 45.30 over 161 one-day internationals. He played a pivotal role in winning two World Cups in the format. While bidding farewell to ODIs, Warner remains a sought-after name in franchise cricket and remains available for Australia in the shortest format. He expressed hope to participate in the T20 World Cup scheduled for June. He has been involved in many controversies during his career.

Run-in with Quinton de Kock

David Warner and South Africa batsman Quinton de Kock faced charges from the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2013 for their heated off-field exchange during the first test in Durban. CCTV footage captured their fiery exchange in the players' tunnel at Kingsmead, resulting in Warner being fined 75% of his match fee and De Kock 25%.

Ball tampering controversy
In 2013, Warner faced severe consequences for his involvement in ball tampering during a match against South Africa in Cape Town. He was suspended from international and state cricket for 12 months and banned from holding a leadership position in the test team ever again. Warner, identified as the instigator, instructed junior batsman Cameron Bancroft on how to tamper with the ball using sandpaper. Bancroft received a nine-month ban, and captain Steve Smith was also banned for a year.

Warner, acknowledging his role in damaging cricket, apologized for the incident, taking responsibility for the stain on the game. He faced not only a suspension but also a significant financial penalty.

Run-in with Joe Root

In 2023, Warner was briefly suspended for punching England batsman Joe Root in a Birmingham bar after a Champions Trophy match. He pleaded guilty to breaching ""Unbecoming Behaviour"" rules and was fined 11,500 Australian dollars. The altercation allegedly started when Root wore a green and gold fancy dress wig, provoking Warner to swing a punch.

Twitter rant against journalists
In 2013, Warner was fined A$5,750 for a Twitter outburst against journalists during the Indian Premier League (IPL). Upset about a newspaper using his picture alongside an article on IPL corruption, he insulted two journalists. Warner acknowledged his inappropriate tweets, expressing regret for any offense caused.

Skipping a match to watch horse race
Another incident in 2013 involved Warner receiving a one-match suspended sentence from Cricket New South Wales for skipping a grade match to attend a horse race at Royal Randwick.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/zomato-shares-rise-3-on-platform-fee-hike/articleshow/106478396.cms,"Shares of food delivery platform Zomato rose 3% to Rs 128.3 in Tuesday's trade on BSE after the firm increased the platform fee it charges users for food delivery to Rs 4 per order in its key markets from Rs 3. The 33% increase is effective from January 1.

According to global brokerage firm CLSA, the 33% platform fee hike would partially offset the impact of GST on delivery charges.

Earlier in December 2023, Zomato received a Rs 402-crore show-cause notice from the goods and services tax (GST) authorities over unpaid dues.

The listed firm started levying a flat platform fee in August 2023. Initially, it was Rs 2 per order and was subsequently increased to Rs 3 in most of its major markets.

“These are business calls which we take basis various factors from time to time,” a Zomato spokesperson told ET on the platform fee hike, but did not provide further details.

Zomato’s closest rival, Bengaluru-based Swiggy, too, last year began charging a Rs 2 fee, which was later hiked to Rs 3.

Zomato levies the platform fee in addition to a delivery charge, which is waived for customers of its loyalty programme, Zomato Gold, who make an upfront payment and get benefits such as discounts and free delivery. The platform fee, however, is applicable to Zomato Gold members as well.

At 12.05 pm, the scrip was trading 2.2% higher at Rs 127.2 on BSE. Zomato's stocks also delivered multibagger returns in the past one year, as it has rallied over 110%. In the last three months, the stock surged over 25%.

Zomato-owned quick-commerce platform Blinkit levies a handling charge of Rs 2 on every order.

In its July-September quarterly results, Zomato’s management had attributed the improvement in its take rate — or the percentage of what the company makes on every order — for food delivery to the introduction of the platform fee.

According to a research note by Jefferies in November, Zomato’s take rate in the September quarter of fiscal 2024 was 24.1%, improving 28 basis points (0.28 percentage point) from a year earlier and 32 basis points from the previous three-month period.

The report estimated Zomato to have delivered around 190 million orders during the quarter, 14% higher than the same period last year.

The three-month period ended September 30 saw Zomato post its second consecutive quarterly net profit. It reported a profit after tax of Rs 36 crore during the quarter. In the April-June quarter, it had reported a net profit of Rs 2 crore.

Technically, the stock's day RSI (14) is at 54.1. The RSI below 30 is considered oversold, and above 70 is overbought, Trendlyne data showed. MACD is at 2.6, which is above its Center Line, but below signal line. Shares of Zomato are also trading higher than the 50-day, and 200-day moving averages.

The three-storey railway station building is equipped with modern features including lifts, escalators, food plazas, shops for puja needs, cloakrooms, child care rooms, and waiting halls. The station will be 'accessible for all' and will be an 'IGBC-certified green station building'.

The Prime Minister also dedicated three railway projects worth Rs 2,300 crore, which include the Rooma Chakeri-Chanderi third line project, Jaunpur-Tulsi Nagar, Akbarpur-Ayodhya, Sohawal-Patranga, and Safdarganj-Rasauli sections of the Jaunpur-Ayodhya-Barabanki doubling project, as well as the doubling and electrification project of the Malhaur-Daliganj railway section.

Projects worth about Rs 11,100 crore were kicked off for the development of Ayodhya and its surrounding areas, while projects worth about Rs 4,600 crore were inaugurated related to other regions across Uttar Pradesh.

Earlier, on Friday, the Prime Minister took to social media to extoll the virtues of his government's plans for Ayodhya, saying, ""Our government is determined to develop world-class infrastructure, improve connectivity and preserve the rich heritage of Ayodhya, the city of Lord Shri Ram. In this direction, I will inaugurate the newly constructed airport and redeveloped railway station tomorrow. Along with this, I will also get the privilege of inaugurating and laying the foundation stone of many more development projects, which will make the lives of my family members in many areas of the country, including Ayodhya and UP, easier.""

Giving Ayodhya its wings
Among the projects inaugurated by the Prime Minister is the new airport's first phase, which cost an estimated Rs 1,450 crore. The airport's terminal building spans an area of 6500 sqm, equipped to serve about 10 lakh passengers annually.

According to a government release, the airport has a runway length of 2200 metres and is suitable for the operation of A321-type aircraft. Two link taxiways and an apron suitable for parking eight A321-type aircraft along with a Ground Support Equipment (GSE) have been constructed.

Airport Authority of India (AAI) chairman Sanjeev Kumar on Saturday explained how the airport had been built in record time and was important for the temple city, which is set to see a boom in tourism, thanks to the temple.

""Air connectivity is important for Ayodhya. With more passenger flow, the connectivity will also improve in Ayodhya. We at Airport Authority are extremely excited about this expansion, I believe the people of Ayodhya are also happy,"" Kumar said.

Under Phase 2, the development of a new terminal building spanning 50,000 sqm has been planned which will be able to serve 4,000 passengers during peak hours and 60 lakh passengers annually.

The terminal building of the airport is equipped with various sustainability features including an insulated roofing system, LED lighting, rain water harvesting to recharge the groundwater table, a water treatment plant, a sewage treatment plant and a solar power plant with a capacity of 250 KWP, designed to meet GRIHA - 5-star ratings.

The temple at the heart of it all
Ayodhya, which was the site of the biggest temple-mosque dispute of all, is now being readied for the consecration, of the Ram Lalla idol at the newly built temple on January 22. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other major political leaders will be in attendance at the mega event that comes just months ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.

A ceremony celebrating the commencement of the construction took place on August 5, 2020, with the construction being supervised by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. They began the first phase of construction of the Ram Temple in March 2020 and expect all work to be done by the time the consecration date comes around.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/gail-shares-plunge-5-on-kotak-equities-downgrade/articleshow/106478099.cms,"Shares of GAIL (India) plunged 5% to the day’s low of Rs 158.10 on Tuesday following a downgrade by Kotak Institutional Equities, which said that the stock was running ahead of its fundamentals on optimism.

Kotak recommended a ‘Sell’ on the counter from an earlier ‘Reduce’ stance for a price target of Rs 125 which is a 25% downside from the Monday closing price of Rs 166.

A few months ago, when oil prices were firming up, it was seen as a proxy to higher oil prices but it has not corrected with the oil price fall, Kotak said. On the contrary, the stock has been even stronger due to optimism of higher transmission volumes, the note said.

GAIL (India) shares have rallied 67% in last one year, outperforming Nifty which has delivered 19% returns during this time. Meanwhile, the gains by Nifty Oil & Gas have been to the tune of 13%.

While oil PSUs have done well, GAIL has been particularly strong and the company is realising an 18-20% higher tariff for its integrated natural gas pipeline (INGPL) network which is a positive, in Kotak's opinion.

In Kotak’s view, despite the recent strong gas consumption data, India’s medium-term gas demand outlook is weak and the long-term outlook is even weaker for its petchem and LPG businesses.

In petchem, GAIL has reported an EBIT loss for the past five quarters. “In 2HFY24, though feedstock costs should decline (on lower HPHT ceiling), domestic PE prices are down 4-5%. Return to profitability looks difficult,” Kotak note said. Moreover, GAIL’s further large capex in petchem has been a key worry amid weak profitability.

As for the LPG segment, profitability should return in 2HFY24 though at the current APM price, GAIL’s breakeven LPG price is Rs43-44/kg and losses can return during the summers (1HFY25), Kotak note said.

The stock is currently trading above its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs). The recent rally has brought the stock into the overbought zone with momentum indicators RSI and MFI at 78 and 80, respectively. A number above 70 is considered as overbought while below 30 is oversold."

The panel has made several other suggestions in its report on the Demand for Grants pertaining to the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT).

The panel has noted that ""there is a huge shortage of 1,472 officers. As per the data provided by DoPT, there are 850 vacancies in the direct recruitment posts and 622 vacancies in the promotion posts.""

To address the issue of the shortage of IAS officers, the Central government has been recruiting 180 IAS officers on an annual basis. The Committee has recommended the DoPT to consider increasing the annual intake of direct recruit IAS officers to bridge the deficit, the report added. It also pointed out that the deficit of IAS officers stems partly from the fact that the promotion quota IAS vacancies are not being filled up by states on time.

DoPT further said that out of the prescribed Central Deputation Reserve of 1,469 officers, only 442 officers were working at the Centre. The panel said this issue needs to be taken up by the Centre with the state governments.

The Committee also noted that a large number of IAS officers were not filing their Annual Immovable Property Returns and suggested that the DoPT should put in a mechanism to check the veracity of the property return statement filed by public servants.

Regarding the UPSC examinations, the panel stated that it takes nearly 15 months for the process -- from the date of issue of notification to the date of declaration of results -- to be completed. ""The committee is of the opinion that the duration of any recruitment examination should not ordinarily exceed six months as long and protracted recruitment cycles waste prime years of a candidate's life besides taking a heavy toll on their physical and mental health,"" it said.

Responding to the panel's observation, the government citing data on the number of candidates who apply and the logistics involved, said that the time cycle for the Civil Services Examination has been optimised to the extent possible. ""Further reduction in the above time cycle of civil services examination may not only impinge upon the integrity/quality of the examinations but may also create resentment among candidates due to getting lesser number of days for their preparation at each stage of the examination,"" the DoPT informed the panel.

It said UPSC and should take steps to ensure that candidates are allotted an examination centre within 5 km from their homes."

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/hotels-/-restaurants/itc-to-scale-up-cloud-kitchen-business-enter-more-cities/articleshow/106459440.cms,"Kolkata: ITC is going to scale up the cloud kitchen business it has been piloting in Bengaluru. The conglomerate, which sells North Indian lunch and dinner and bakery products through food delivery apps, has rolled it out in Chennai with plans to venture into Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata. It is also evaluating adding breakfast and oriental cuisines, said executive director Hemant Malik.

The company calls this business food-tech, which it has identified as one of the emerging vectors of growth. It currently runs three brands: Aashirvaad Soul Creations for North Indian daily or comfort food, ITC Master Chef Creations for North Indian gourmet cuisines, and ITC Sunfeast Baked Creations for bakery products. There are 19 cloud kitchens in Bengaluru and four in Chennai. The kitchens have already broken even.

""We have a winning formula, which includes having established brands that come with certain credibility, cuisine supported by ITC Hotels' chefs, and capabilities of the packaged foods business,"" said Malik.

""The tech-learning needed for the business comes from our focus on digitalisation. The model involves setting up of central kitchen and satellite kitchens in cities where we operate. We are already the in Bengaluru in the space within two years of operation and will now scale up in other cities,"" said Malik.



The model involves a central kitchen and several satellite kitchens as Swiggy and Zomato prefer kitchens every 2.5-3 km. ITC's food tech central kitchen in Bengaluru can service both Chennai and Hyderabad. ""Our strategy is to add new cuisines and meals apart from expansion into the metros,"" said Malik.

The average order value for the ITC cloud kitchens is Rs 900, which is double that of the industry. The main differences between these and the kitchen of ITC Hotels is that this business involves 5% goods and services tax (GST) while it is 18% GST for hotel restaurants, and this is quick service. ITC has already delivered over one million orders

In a recent investor presentation, ITC said the cloud kitchen business has institutional synergies with ITC such as food business involving FSSAI regulations, packaging solutions for fresh food delivery, digital first approach to garner consumer feedback for future FMCG products, culinary expertise of the hotels business, and industrial ready-to-eat and frozen food products.

Around 90% of the orders in food delivery platforms are placed in dine-in restaurants, while the balance 10% in cloud kitchens. The company in the presentation said North Indian cuisine scalability is an issue since these are dependent on chef skills and lack of standardisation."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/secularism-has-become-pejorative-for-those-now-in-power-sonia-gandhi/articleshow/106478776.cms,"Describing secularism as a foundational pillar of India's democracy, Congress leader Sonia Gandhi said the word secular is being used as a ""pejorative"" by those now in power, resulting in increased polarisation in the society.

""They say they are committed to 'democracy', but at the same time, they weaken the safeguards meant to ensure its smooth working. The train tracks meant to guide our nation to harmony are being damaged and the results are already being seen in the increased polarisation in society,"" Gandhi wrote in a signed article for Manorama Yearbook 2024.

Democracy and secularism are deeply interconnected -- like two rails on a track, guiding the government of the day to the ideal of a harmonious society. ""We are all familiar with these words, which we encounter in debates, speeches, civics textbooks, and the Preamble to the Constitution.

Despite this familiarity, the deep meanings behind these concepts are often elusive. A clear understanding of these terms will help every citizen better understand India's history, the challenges of the present, and the path to the future,"" the former Congress chief said. Gandhi pointed out that secularism can be interpreted in several ways but the meaning most relevant to India was the one laid down by Mahatma Gandhi in his famous term, 'sarva dharma sama bhaava'.

""Gandhiji perceived the essential unity of all religions. Jawaharlal Nehru was deeply conscious of India being a multi-religious society, so he constantly strove to establish a secular state,"" she is quoted as saying in a release issued by Malayala Manorama here. She also said that India's Constitution makers, led by Dr B R Ambedkar, developed and applied this idea to the government, creating a unique secular democracy.

""The government...protects the religious beliefs of all. It has special provisions to protect the welfare of minorities. The guiding principle of Indian secular democracy is always to promote harmony and prosperity between all the diverse groups in our society,"" the senior Lok Sabha MP said. Gandhi, who was the longest serving president of the Congress party for over 20 years (from 1998 to 2017 and from 2019 to 2022), said India has always been defined by its extraordinary diversity.

""In fact, in our society it makes more sense to speak of 'diversities' instead of just 'diversity' since they encompass faiths and beliefs, languages and cultural practices, regions and ecologies, histories and traditions. Yet there has always been a sense of overarching unity that led our Founding Fathers to give us the legacy of Unity in Diversity,"" she argued.

""Diversity strengthens our unity and solidarity when it is celebrated as indeed it is in our magnificent Constitution that is now under assault,"" she said.

Gandhi also raised an important issue regarding the functioning of democracy. In a democracy, the government is formed by a majority of votes. ""But if a majority of people agree, can they always have a way over the remainder? What happens if the core interests of a small group are hurt? What is the remedy if a temporary majority insists on taking a decision which may have grave future consequences? On the other hand, if an enduring but slim majority is formed, do they have the right to govern unchallenged?"" she said.

This question is especially grave in diverse countries such as India, where people share so many different identities which are precious to them. ""If people worry that their language or religious practice or way of life could be permanently threatened only because they were not many in number, it does not help peace or harmony in society,"" she noted. Gandhi said democracy is not a perfect system, and quoted Jawaharlal Nehru's observation: ""Democracy is good.

I say this because other systems are worse... It has good points and also bad."" The freedom fighters knew from the experience of democracy in other countries that the system is prone to ailments and laid down principles to guard against these illnesses, such as a written Constitution, Fundamental Rights of citizens against the government, and the principle of secularism.

Noting that progressive people in India have always tried to find solutions to the challenges of the times, she said, adding: ""It is time for us too, to find our own solutions to the challenges of today, and in so doing, serve and honour our nation.""

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/shortage-of-epc-players-slows-down-wind-energy-projects/articleshow/106459271.cms,"The wind energy sector is facing a unique shortage-- of EPC players. Four wind energy companies have gone bankrupt and over a dozen have changed business models in the past five years, leading to a scarcity of engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services in the sector. This is slowing down wind energy projects, according to industry officials.

These companies include Wind World, RRB Energy, NEPC Micon, Pioneer Windcon, etc. among others. ""There were 32 players in 2016-17, now it is down to 12. And of these, four are in NCLT,"" said Ajay Devaraj, secretary general, the Indian Wind Power Association (IWPA), adding that in 2017, after the government changed the wind energy bidding norms from feed-in-tariff to auction regime, the business model of these companies changed and captive generation died.

In 2017, the wind energy sector moved from feed-in tariffs (FiTs) to competitive bidding with reverse auctions. The aim was to ensure transparency and achieve lower tariffs.

FiTs meant tariff was fixed by regulators and not discovered through competitive bidding. In reverse auction, developers engaged in aggressive bidding quoting the lowest possible tariffs making the execution of wind projects challenging. Last year the government did away with the reverse auction regime.

So till 2017, companies were providing EPC solutions too but ever since the auction regime started, some companies stopped offering these services. Until 2017, the wind energy players were providing equipment and operation and maintenance services.

""What's happening in the sector, is that the EPC players have completely vanished from the scene, except us. The largest people who talk about, they just only supply the components, not even the turbine,"" Himanshu Mody, chief financial officer at Suzlon Energy told analysts last month.

Mody added that turbines are getting supplied, but the corresponding capacity to build the BOP (balance of plants) to take it to the commission is lacking in the country.

BOP scope of work includes both civil engineering and electrical engineering like turbine foundations, meteorological mast foundations, cable trenches and buildings for electrical switchgear, underground cable networks and overhead transmission lines, among others.

""As we also look at in future, we see a significant risk of turbines supplied lying on the ground, but not getting commissioned. That's a concern for the sector as a whole because today you have more suppliers and less of the people who can bridge the gap between the supply to the commissioning,"" added Mody

In Q2FY23, Suzlon's order book mix comprised 53% for EPC scope and 47% non-epc scope. The company said more and more players are asking for EPC services.

""Effectively what's happened is, a few players have gone bankrupt. It's only two key players now left who do turnkey,"" Devansh Jain, Wholetime Director, Inox Wind told ET.

Jain added that his company is seeing overwhelming demand for turnkey projects but it is focused on the public sector enterprises.

From January to October 2023, India added about 8.7 GW of solar capacity and 2.36 GW of wind capacity. Total renewable energy capacity added in the country stood at 132.13 GW.

Last November the government launched the National Repowering and Life Extension Policy for Wind Power Projects 2023 - to re-power wind power projects to replace older wind turbines. While the policy is expected to help the utilisation of wind energy resources by maximizing energy yield per square kilometer, industry players said with the new policy, demand for EPC services would further go up."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/cobra-kai-season-6-confirmed-episode-count-and-release-date-window-revealed/articleshow/106421730.cms,"As the festive season unfolded, the creators of Cobra Kai engaged with fans, offering As fans eagerly await the return of ""Cobra Kai"" for its sixth and final season, the creators have been engaging with the audience over the festive period, offering glimpses into what to expect.

The latest revelations include a confirmed episode count, with a twist, and hints at the release date window for the highly anticipated season.

Firstly, the creators have officially confirmed that ""Cobra Kai"" Season 6 will consist of 10 episodes, maintaining the format of its predecessors. However, the intriguing aspect is the promise of an expanded runtime. Hayden Schlossberg, one of the showrunners, shared, ""10 episodes but the total runtime for the full season will be the longest."" This suggests that while the episode count remains consistent, fans can anticipate more content and a deeper exploration of the storyline.

Responding to a fan's query about the episode runtime, Schlossberg also confirmed that the last episode would be longer than usual, teasing an extended and impactful conclusion to the series.

As for the release date, the creators have been relatively tight-lipped, but there have been some clues. In response to fans' inquiries, Schlossberg mentioned multiple times that they are aiming for a 2024 release window. While he emphasized their desire to release the season as soon as possible, he reiterated that 2024 is the goal. This aligns with the recent conclusion of Hollywood strikes in 2023, allowing production to move forward.

When will the filming of Cobra Kai Season 6 begin?
Filming for Season 6 is set to kick off early in 2024, as indicated by Jon Hurwitz, another showrunner, who expressed his excitement about starting filming in a couple of weeks from December 18th. This implies that the production will commence in the first week of January 2024, signaling an enthusiastic start to bringing the final season to life.

Although further details were not disclosed, viewers can look forward to the revelation of the new dojo name early in Season 6, specifically in the first episode. Additionally, there is a ""good chance"" that the remaining students from Silver's Cobra Kai will join Miyagi-Fang, setting the stage for potential alliances and conflicts within the dojo dynamics.

As ""Cobra Kai"" gears up for its final round, fans can anticipate not only the familiar martial arts action but also an extended and immersive narrative experience. The promise of a longer last episode hints at a grand finale that will leave a lasting impact on the ""Cobra Kai"" legacy.

While the release date specifics are yet to be unveiled, the creators' commitment to a 2024 window adds to the excitement surrounding the conclusion of this beloved series.

FAQs
Will Cobra Kai have a season 6?
After the resolution of the SAG-AFTRA strike in early November 2023, the commencement of production for Cobra Kai Season 6 is expected in early 2024. Despite the typical regularity of new Cobra Kai seasons on Netflix, subscribers may experience a longer wait for the sixth season.

Why did YouTube sell Cobra Kai?
Cobra Kai found a new home on Netflix to ensure the production of Season 4. As it no longer aligned with YouTube's company strategy and faced uncertainties due to the cancellation of other scripted content on the platform, Cobra Kai needed a new outlet to secure its future, particularly since it was denied further commission beyond the third season.

Born in Reading, Pennsylvania, on December 13, 1989, Taylor grew up in a supportive environment, with Scott, a financial advisor, being a consistent and encouraging presence in her life.

However, recent developments have brought Scott Swift into the spotlight due to a controversial email that surfaced as part of an ongoing lawsuit filed by Daniel Dymtrow, a former manager of Taylor Swift.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/isros-first-solar-mission-aditya-l1-to-reach-its-destination-on-january-6-chairman-somanath/articleshow/106441509.cms,"ISRO's inaugural solar mission, Aditya-L1, which was launched on September 2, is poised for its final maneuver and is set to reach its designated L1 point on January 6, according to ISRO Chairman S Somanath. The spacecraft has successfully completed four earth-bound maneuvers and a Trans-Lagrangean Point 1 Insertion (TL1I) maneuver during its journey.

""Aditya-L1 is going to reach its L1 point on January 6 and we are going to do the final manoeuvre to keep it there,"" the ISRO chief said, on the sidelines of the successful launch of XPoSat mission to study black holes.

Somanath also outlined ISRO's ambitious plans for the year, saying that it is aiming for a minimum of 12 missions.

Regarding the Gaganyaan mission, Somanath mentioned plans for at least two additional abort missions, one unmanned mission (with a target of two), parachute drop tests, and hundreds of valuation tests before the scheduled launch in 2025. The Gaganyaan project aims to demonstrate human spaceflight capability by launching a crew of three members into a 400 km orbit for a three-day mission, returning them safely to Earth.

Somanath emphasized that 2024 would be the year for Gaganyaan readiness, including helicopter-based drop tests to validate parachute systems, multiple drop tests, and numerous valuation tests.

In a notable achievement earlier on the first day of 2024, ISRO successfully launched the X-ray Polarimeter Satellite (XPoSat), marking India's first observation of black holes. Somanath highlighted the satellite's precise placement into the intended orbit of 650 km, with a 6-degree inclination.

It has taken ISRO seven years to build the XPoSat satellite.

""We want to create at least 100 scientists who can understand this aspect and contribute to the knowledge of black holes to the world,"" he added.

Acknowledging the seven-year effort invested in building XPoSat, Somanath expressed the goal of fostering at least 100 scientists capable of understanding and contributing to the world's knowledge of black holes.

Reflecting on India's space achievements in 2023, including the successful soft landing of Chandrayaan-3 on the moon's south pole and the launch of Aditya-L1, Somanath emphasized their impact on India's standing in the global space economy. These milestones have also energized India's private space sector.

What is ISRO's Aditya-L1 mission?
Aditya-L1 is India's first solar mission of observatory-class, which is designed for study of the sun. The spacecraft will be positioned in a halo orbit around the Lagrangian point1 (L1) of the Sun-Earth system, which is approximately 1.5 million km from earth, for ensuring continuous, unobstructed solar observation. The spacecraft is carrying seven payloads for scrutinizing the photosphere, chromosphere, and the Sun's outer layers (corona) through electromagnetic and particle detectors. Positioned at L1, four payloads will observe the Sun directly, while the other three conduct studies of particles and fields. Aditya L1's suite aims to yield vital insights into coronal heating, Coronal Mass Ejection, flare activities, space weather dynamics, particle propagation, and interplanetary medium characteristics.

With time zones creating a sequential tapestry of celebrations, the globe embarks on a journey into the future.

Historical Echoes of New Year Celebrations
The tradition of celebrating the New Year dates back to January 1, 153 BCE, in Rome. While initially, many Romans marked the advent of the New Year on March 1, Julius Caesar's solar-based calendar in 46 BCE established January 1 as the designated day. This practice gained widespread adoption in the Roman Empire, and the Georgian calendar, introduced in 1582, further solidified January 1 as the global New Year's day.

Welcoming the New Year in Kiribati
As the clock strikes midnight and heralds the arrival of January 1, 2024, Kiribati, a country in Oceania, takes the lead in welcoming the New Year. Specifically, Kiritimati Island, also known as Christmas Island, part of Kiribati, will be the first to embrace the new dawn. At 5:00 am ET on December 31, the vibrant celebrations will commence, marking the onset of global festivities.

The Sequential Unfolding of New Year's Eve
Following Kiribati's jubilant start, the torch of New Year's celebration passes to Tonga and Samoa at 6 am ET. The momentum builds as the countdown continues, with New Zealand, Australia, Japan, and South Korea joining the chorus of revelry, each marking the arrival of New Year 2024 in its unique way.

The Culmination in American Samoa
As the world revels in the joyous transition, American Samoa, an island nation in the South Pacific, prepares to bid a final farewell to the passing year. Inhabiting the last time zone, American Samoa stands as the concluding bastion of New Year's Eve festivities. It becomes the last inhabited place to embrace the arrival of January 1, 2024, marking the culmination of global celebrations.

The Technically Last Territories
Intriguingly, if we extend our consideration to uninhabited territories, Baker Island and Howland Island, integral parts of the United States Minor Outlying Islands, claim the title of being technically the last to herald the new year at 7:00 am ET on January 1st. These remote and pristine landscapes witness the dawn of a new era, symbolizing the cyclical nature of time.

As the world unites in bidding adieu to 2023 and extending a warm welcome to New Year 2024, the sequential celebrations symbolize the interconnectedness of humanity across diverse cultures and geographies. The tapestry of time zones weaves a story of shared joy and hope for the possibilities that the upcoming year holds.

FAQs
Which country celebrates New Year first?
Situated to the east of the International Date Line in the central Pacific Ocean, Kiribati, an island country in Oceania, takes the lead in ushering in the New Year at 10 am GMT (3:30 pm IST).

Is New Year a holiday in the USA?
New Year's Day, observed on January 1st, holds the status of a national holiday in the United States. A widely embraced American tradition during this time involves making New Year's resolutions, wherein individuals pledge to improve aspects of their lives in the coming year.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/maruti-retail-sales-of-230000-plus-in-december-highest-in-history-shashank-srivastava/articleshow/106478503.cms,"Shashank Srivastava, Senior Executive Officer (Marketing and Sales), Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, says “in December, we saw inquiries going up about 19%, bookings going up almost about 12%. So, I would expect these large volumes to continue in 2024. However, these are very high levels of volumes, 41 lakh for this calendar year is the highest we have seen in the industry ever and from these high levels of volumes with the pending bookings now getting reduced, I would expect a small single digit growth in the coming year rather than a very large growth. So, there would be good volume level but in terms of growth some muted numbers.”

In December sales are down on back of inventory clearance and plant shutdown. Do you think it could be back to basics, back to November levels starting January?
Shashank Srivastava: Yes, it is actually very successful from an industry point of view. The total wholesale was only about 287,900 against retail which is now estimated to be about 443,000. So, there was a sharp dip in the inventory levels in the industry from 331,000 at the beginning of December to now an estimate of about 176,000. And the same goes for Maruti Suzuki. Our wholesales for passenger vehicles was just about 105,000 whereas our retails were 230,000 plus. So, we could manage to bring down the inventory from around 165,000-168,000 to the level of under 45,000 at the end of December. So, in that sense it has been a fairly successful month and of course the retail of 230,000 plus has been the highest ever in our history.

From January, can we expect sales to bounce back to normal levels? Could you give us a range?
Shashank Srivastava: As I said, December has seen the highest-ever retail in our history. It has to be a bounce down rather than a bounce back because this is the highest ever retail at 230,000 plus. I do not think we can expect 230,000 plus retail sales going forward so quickly. Our normal average is between 130,000 to 140,000. But, yes, in terms of wholesale if that is your question, you would probably see much better numbers than what you saw in December.

So, for the year ahead, what is the outlook when it comes to entry level car demand? Do you think that we can see a smart bounce back this year?
Shashank Srivastava: This year we have seen a decline of about 7% over last year for the hatches. So, last year it was about 13,20,000, this year they were about 12,20,000-12,25,000, about a 7-7.5% decline. It is now about 30% of the overall industry and we expect next year it to be around the same levels. One of the big reasons of course for the last few years of decline in the small car segment has been that affordability has come down, which means prices have gone up faster than the income level of these category of customers.

Going forward, I would expect the affordability factor to get better and if that is the case, you could see some sort of a bounce back. In fact, this year in the larger hatches, the premium hatches, we have seen a growth of about 4% for Maruti and about 2.5% for the industry.

What is the price hike quantum that you are planning to take in the month of January and the question is what is the percentage, which models will see the maximum of it?
Shashank Srivastava: As we have announced, in this stock exchange, the price hikes will be across most of the models. The quantum obviously varies depending on the cost structure of each model. At the moment we have not decided on the quantum or the exact date, but when we reopen, we will see that final round of discussions internally to decide what would be the quantum and when exactly the price hike would happen.

But if you can at least share with us the latest order book number that you have right now in hand and overall what is your outlook for the PV demand in 2024? What kind of number do you expect the industry to grow by?
Shashank Srivastava: PV demand for 2024 should continue at good levels I would say considering that most of the demand patterns are still quite stable. In December, we saw inquiries going up about 19%, bookings going up almost about 12%. So, I would expect these large volumes to continue in 2024. However, these are very high levels of volumes, 41 lakh the volume for this calendar year is the highest we have seen in the industry ever and from these high levels of volumes with the pending bookings now getting reduced, I would expect a small growth, a single digit growth in the coming year rather than a very large growth, so you would see a good volume level but in terms of growth some muted numbers.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/flexicap-funds-explained-do-they-provide-the-play-your-mutual-funds-portfolio-needs/articleshow/106474534.cms,"Flexi cap funds can invest across different market capitalisations such as large, mid and small caps.
Their appeal lies in the hands-on management provided by a professional, alleviating the need for investors to engage in extensive deliberation.
Investors are advised a long term horizon, at least five years or more, while investing in flexi cap funds.
As of November 30, 2023, the assets under management in the flexi-cap category totaled ₹3.06 lakh crore, making it the largest asset base within the equity category, according to Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) data.

Market regulator, SEBI had introduced new guidelines for multi-cap funds on September 11, 2020. The main essence of these proposed changes to the multi-cap category was that, starting from January 31, 2021, these funds would be required to allocate a minimum of 25% of their portfolio to large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks each.

After the announcement of the new guidelines regarding multi-cap funds, there were numerous discussions about the potential drawbacks for both investors and the markets. Recognising these concerns, SEBI appeared to acknowledge the issues and subsequently introduced a new category - flexi cap funds in November 2020.

Flexi cap funds can invest across different market capitalisations such as large, mid and small caps. The benefit of this strategy is that these funds can tweak the allocation across market cap as per the evolving opportunities.

For instance, if the fund manager foresees an impending economic downturn, he or she can tweak the portfolio towards large caps which can give relative stability and protect the downside to some extent. Similarly, having exposure to mid and small cap companies when there is a turnaround helps generate some extra alpha.

This flexibility allows fund managers to adjust their portfolio allocations dynamically, taking advantage of changing market dynamics and identifying potential investment opportunities across different segments of the market.

“It provides them with the freedom to invest in large-cap stocks when they see valuation comfort in that segment, and similarly, in mid-cap or small-cap stocks when they expect that market cap to do well,” says Amey Sathe, Fund Manager, Tata Mutual Fund.

Why the flexicap fund category is so big

The popularity of flexi cap funds stems from their inherent flexibility, sparing investors the need to navigate the complexities of choosing between mid-cap, small-cap, or large-cap investments.

“By opting for a flexicap fund, investors can simply allocate their funds to this class, entrusting the fund manager with the responsibility of strategic allocation based on market conditions,” says Soumya Sarkar, Co-Founder, Wealth Redefine, a mutual fund distribution firm.

The appeal lies in the hands-on management provided by a professional, alleviating the need for investors to engage in extensive deliberation over whether to focus on large-cap, mid-cap, or small-cap investments – a key reason why flexi cap funds are favoured by investors.

Most of the fund managers have been managing this category conservatively with a tilt towards large cap and use mid and small cap portions as a tool to alpha generation.

“Given the current scenario where large-cap has not run up much and small-cap has given a tremendous run, investors are allocating into the funds that are heavy on large-cap but at the same time give some flavour of mid and small-cap stocks which is talk of the town,” says Mukesh kochar National Head of Wealth at AUM Capital, a wealth management firm.

Returns

In the last one year, flexi cap funds as a category have given returns of 28.29% according to Valueresearch, while the three-year return has been 19.65%. Flexicap funds are benchmarked against the Nifty 500 Total Return Index (TRI) which has returned 22.51% in the last year.

“We expect the category to gain prominence in 2024 considering valuation in various market caps is at crossroads and there is no compulsion to invest in categories wherein valuations are expensive,” says Sathe.

Should you invest?

Choosing to invest in a flexi-cap fund demands careful thought owing to its high risk nature. Unlike more conservative alternatives like balanced advantage funds, hybrid funds, or large-cap funds, flexi-cap funds carry increased risk by distributing funds across mid-cap and small-cap categories.

This renders them inappropriate for risk-averse investors but appealing to those comfortable with higher levels of risk.

Investors must recognize that their money, regardless of the amount, will be invested in mid-cap and small-cap categories, requiring a sufficient risk appetite and time horizon.

“If investors lack these attributes, it may be advisable to avoid flexi-cap funds; however, for those willing to embrace some risk without extensive analysis, flexi-cap funds present a viable investment option,” says Sarkar.

Investors should thus have a long term horizon, at least five years or more, while investing in flexi cap funds. Investors should spread their allocation across funds with different styles (growth and value) for diversification.

Kochar advises that for the first-time investor, it is advisable to go through the balance advantage fund route as these are more stable and less volatile compared to a flexicap fund which is 100% equity-oriented.

These funds are relatively less risky as compared to sector or thematic funds. However, they are not completely immune to volatility. Thus, investors should be prepared to withstand some volatility and have a long term horizon while investing in this category of funds."

Pannun aims to disrupt ""India's economic system"" on March 12, coinciding with the 31st anniversary of the 1993 serial bomb blasts in Mumbai that claimed numerous lives, as reported by TOI.

Pannun, in a statement released on Monday, said that the economic infrastructure of India serves as the backbone for what he described as the ""Modi regime's transnational repression."" His strategy involves encouraging people to ""Dump Indian Stock"" and ""Buy American Stocks"" before the specified date. The security agencies are on high alert as they assess the potential impact of such actions on the financial stability of the nation.

Authorities are taking this threat seriously, considering the historical significance of March 12.

Earlier in December, Pannun had threatened to attack the Parliament and said that he would ""...destabilize the core of Parliament"" either on or before December 13. The announcement came closely after reports surfaced about a purportedly thwarted attempt to assassinate him on American territory.

Few days after the Pannun's announcement, in a big ""security lapse"", two intruders breached the Parliament security and jumped into the well of Lok Sabha, causing uproar and inducing panic among Members of Parliament in the Lower House on December 13, the anniversary of deadly Pakistan-based terrorist attack in 2001.

Nevertheless, as of now, there is no confirmed link between December Parliament attack and Pannun's earlier threat.

Divyanath, a septuagenarian monk, who was on his way to Kamakhya, boarded the Amrit Bharat Express on way to Puri Jagannath Temple when he saw the train at Bardhaman station in West Bengal.

""I was at Bardhaman to take a train to Guwahati to visit the Kamakhya temple there, but when I saw this new train heading south, I decided to board it and visit the Jagannath Temple in Puri,"" the monk told this correspondent while sitting in one of the gleaming new bogies of the new rake on Saturday evening.

Divyanath said he had embarked on this path of spiritualism when he was in his teens. His guru's ashram is located in Panipat, Haryana. He said he has been traveling across the country from Himachal to Kanyakumari and from Gujarat to Nagaland for several decades.

""I used to travel by trains drawn by steam engines, and now I am in this beautiful new coach. New things will continue to evolve as time passes,"" he said.

With only a small sack and a wooden stick as his belongings, Divyanath emphasised there should be no differences among people based on religion, caste, or creed.

""We all belong to Bharat, whether Hindu, Muslim, or Sikh. We are all of the same country. Why should there be any conflict between any of us?"" he said.

Motor mechanic Amit Bairagi, accompanying his wife, was heading to Bengaluru for a medical reason. He considered himself lucky to have obtained permission to board the Amrit Bharat Express since it would have been difficult to get a reservation on such a short notice.

""My wife had a medical condition in 2019, and after receiving treatment at a hospital in Bengaluru, she was fine. However, a recurrence occurred suddenly the day before yesterday, and we need to reach the hospital soon,"" Bairagi said.

He explained that they only learned about the inaugural run of the train on Friday and managed to obtain a pass just in time to travel from Rampurhat station in Birbhum district.

Tony Mondal, who works as an unskilled laborer at a construction firm in Bengaluru, was among around 20 others of the same profession who received a free pass to travel to the Karnataka capital from Malda.

After working as a migrant labourer in Bengaluru for three years, Tony had returned home to Baishnabnagar in Malda district for a family function.

""We came to Malda station after learning about the inaugural run of the train, and we were given free passes to travel on it,"" said his companion Sujan Mondal, who saw the ticket price savings as a blessing.

According to a railway official, tickets are not sold on the inaugural run of a train.

The train, which is scheduled to take approximately 42 hours to complete its journey, will start its commercial run on January 7.

These migrant workers, who travel between their homes and workplaces every six months or so, described it as a magnificent experience to travel on the new train with its ergonomically designed toilets, snazzy upholstery, and other facilities, compared to the ""nightmare"" of traveling in the general compartment of some other trains.

The train's rakes have radium-illuminated flooring strips, CCTV surveillance for safe travel, mobile charging points, standalone passenger announcements, and public information systems. The public address system is operated by the train guard, according to South Eastern Railway spokesperson Aditya Kumar Chaudhary.

Several school students were also given joyrides for short durations on the train, one of the two Amrit Bharat Express trains inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday.

""After assessing passenger demand, the appropriate authorities will consider increasing the frequency of the train and introducing AC coaches,"" Chowdhury said.

The Amrit Bharat Express consists of 22 non-AC coaches, including 12 sleeper class coaches, eight general coaches, and two luggage rakes.

It will have two WAP-5 locomotives manufactured by Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) at the front and rear ends in a push-pull configuration to ensure faster acceleration and eliminate the need to switch locomotives at stations, Chowdhury added.

Earlier in the week, the Asian Games gold medallist had announced her decision to return her awards, stating that these honors had lost their significance during a period when wrestlers are grappling for justice. Phogat had conveyed this decision in a letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Her attempt to personally deliver the awards to the Prime Minister's office on Saturday was thwarted by the police, prompting her to leave the awards at Kartavya Path, which were later retrieved by Delhi Police. This act was a mark of her protest against the current state of affairs in the wrestling community.

Vinesh was conferred with the Khel Ratna, the highest sports honour in India, in 2020 while she received the Arjuna Award in 2016.

Phogat, alongside fellow Olympic medallists Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia, had raised objections to the election of Sanjay Singh, a close associate of the former Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) President, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh who had faced allegations of sexual harassment from prominent grapplers.

The grapplers had held a long drawn protest at Jantar Mantar early this year. The matter is being in a Delhi court.

Sakshi Malik had even announced her retirement from wrestling soon after Sanjay Singh assumed the position of WFI Chief. The Sports Ministry later suspended the newly-elected panel for not adhering to the provisions of its own constitution while making decisions. Subsequently, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) was instructed to form an ad-hoc panel to oversee the affairs of the wrestling body.

Phogat, in her letter posted on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), emphasized the disparity between their real lives and the glossy portrayals in ""fancy government advertisements"" discussing women's empowerment.

Responding to the Sports Ministry's directive, the IOA established a three-member ad hoc committee on Wednesday to manage the day-to-day operations of the Wrestling Federation of India.

Phogat, a two-time World Championship medalist, reiterated her decision in her letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, underscoring that the Khel Ratna and Arjuna awards no longer held any meaning in her life.

Fidelity cut by a further 11% the value of its holding in X as of the end of November, the report said, citing the latest portfolio update for its Blue Chip Growth Fund.

It extended a series of markdowns as the mutual fund firm gauged the value of the closely held ad-funded company that struggled to attract advertisers back in 2023.

Musk’s acquisition of Twitter in late October 2022 was followed by a cascade of abrupt changes, from drastic layoffs and shuttering of international offices to upending the platform’s moderation policies and verification system.

The upheaval put off advertisers and 2023’s revenue from ad sales is estimated to come in at $2.5 billion, far below the prior rate of roughly $1 billion per quarter, Bloomberg News reported last month.

In November, Musk famously told advertisers that abandoned X over his endorsement of an antisemitic post that they can “f——” themselves. Earlier that month, Musk agreed with a post that said Jewish people held a “dialectical hatred” of White people.

That message has since drawn criticism from the White House as well as several Tesla Inc. investors. Major corporate spenders, including Walt Disney Co. and Apple Inc., distanced themselves from the platform."

Demonstrating Requisite Skills
The GRE test measures skills that graduate and business programs have identified as critical for success, and therefore, that they look for in their applicants. GRE scores reflect candidates’ proficiency in critical thinking, verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and analytical writing – skills that students will actually use in the classroom across most disciplines. Although coursework and GPAs can also indicate proficiency in these skills, GPAs vary greatly across countries and across programs based on the rigor of the institution. This is where a standardized measure holds special value for the admissions committee. The GRE can also help a student provide an additional verification of their skills, which can be useful if their undergraduate performance was not as solid as they wished it had been.

Unlocking Career Prospects
GRE performance extends benefits beyond the academic realm. Various industry sectors acknowledge the merit of GRE scores as indicators of analytical and problem-solving abilities. In the job market, GRE scores can distinguish a candidate, potentially leading to better career avenues and enhanced remuneration packages.

Fostering Personal Growth and Tenacity
Preparing for the GRE requires planning, focus and perseverance. This journey hones essential skills that are important in academia and in life, such as time management, discipline, and intrinsic motivation. The fortitude and personal growth cultivated during test preparation can be invaluable in addressing the complexities of an academic or professional setup.

Summarily, the GRE offers access to multiple graduate programs, and unveils a spectrum of career paths. It is an excellent reflection of test-takers’ proficiency in critical thinking, verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and analytical writing and hence becoming pivotal in the b-school admissions process.

Rasgotra, a 1989-batch police officer of the Manipur cadre, was handed over the customary baton by his predecessor Anish Dayal Singh.

Singh has been appointed as the DG of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).

The new ITBP DG was given a guard of honour by a ceremonial unit of troops at the headquarters of the force at Lodhi Road before he took charge, a senior officer said.

The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) had issued orders for the appointment of Rasgotra as ITBP head on December 28.

The officer has spent nearly three decades in the Intelligence Bureau handling important desks and was serving as its special director.

He is slated to retire in September 2025.

The about 90,000 personnel strong ITBP is primarily tasked to guard the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China apart from rendering a variety of duties in the internal security domain.

Addressing the convocation ceremony of state-run Bharathidasan University here, the Prime Minister quoted the 'Puthiyathor Ulagam Seivom' Tamil verses of poet Bharathidasan, after whom the university had been named, and said it meant creating a brave new world which is also the university's motto.

Modi said the Indian youth were already creating such a world. The Indian scientists are on the world map through missions like Chandrayaan and 'our innovators took the number of patents from around 4,000 in 2014 to almost 50,000 now.'

India's 'humanity scholars are showcasing the India story to the world like never before.' Also, the nation's musicians and artists were continuously bringing international awards for the country, he said.

Giving back to the people for a better society and country is the true purpose of education, he underlined.

Modi is the first prime Minister to address the convocation ceremony of the varsity, established in 1982.

In a very brief interaction with a group of students, he asked if anyone was interested to go to Delhi, to which two women students raised their hands and smiled.

The Prime Minister paid floral tributes to a bust of Bharathidasan (1891-1964), hailed as revolutionary Tamil poet, and he posed for a group-photograph with students, Governor R N Ravi and Chief Minister M K Stalin.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/congress-uddhav-thackeray-differ-on-seat-sharing-formula-for-lok-sabha-polls/articleshow/106459350.cms,"Mumbai: The Congress and the Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray (UBT) faction of the Shiv Sena are engaged in some tense negotiations over contesting Lok Sabha seats with the UBT seeking to contest in those seats which it had contested in 2019 and the Congress insisting on 'merit'. Besides seeking 23 of the total 48 seats in the state, the Sena (UBT) is seeking to contest most of the seats in the Mumbai Metropolitan region which the Congress is resisting.

The Congress does not accept the Sena (UBT) formula that each party should contest in the same seats as it did in 2019 as it believes that the situation has changed since 2019 as the Shiv Sena has split and has substantially weakened. It is using this merit of winnability to claim seats. For instance, the Congress is keen that it be given the Mumbai-South constituency, which is currently being represented by two-term Sena-UBT MP, Arvind Sawant. The Congress wants the seat as it believes that former Mumbai South MP Milind Deora has a better chance of winning.

""Deora has a better chance to win the seat as the constituency has a sizeable number of Marwaris and Jains as well as Muslims. The Sena here has no presence and Sawant won the two polls only because the Jain-Marwari community votes went to Sawant as he was the BJP-Sena candidate. With the Sena split and Sena not partnering with the BJP, Sawant would find it difficult to win. Milind has a better chance of winning,"" said a Congress leader.

In informal talks with the Congress, Uddhav Thackeray has expressed his inability to give the seat to the Congress claiming that Sawant was one of the few leaders who has been loyal to him after Eknath Shinde split the party.

The Congress has suggested to Uddhav to have Sawant contest from some other seat in Mumbai. Meanwhile, the Congress has also sought Mumbai North Central seat and Mumbai South Central seat. While the Sena (UBT) does not have an issue over Mumbai North Central seat as the seat is currently being represented by BJP's Poonam Mahajan and the fight has historically been between the Congress and the BJP, it is resisting parting with the Mumbai South Central seat. The seat is currently held by Rahul Shewale who has sided with Shiv Sena (Shinde). The Congress is insisting on the seat as it argues that with Shewale joining the Shinde faction, the Sena (UBT) would find it hard to win the seat. The constituency has a sizeable number of Dalits which it believes would help the party to win the seat.

This merit versus the Sena (UBT)'s argument that those who contested the seat in 2019 should contest it again, is not just seen in Mumbai but even in the entire Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) which comprises Navi Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli, Bhiwandi and Mira- Bhayandar. The Sena (UBT) is hesitant to hand over the seats to the Congress on these seats.

Congress leaders said Uddhav Thackeray has spoken to senior members of the Congress leadership and is expected to fly down to Delhi for talks. In a sign of how tenuous the ties with its allies are, the state Congress leadership has informed the Congress high command that the Sena (UBT) may join hands with the BJP after the Lok Sabha polls if the latter falls short of numbers and hence it is better that the Congress contests in as many seats as possible.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/india-needs-a-realistic-approach-not-nehruvian-romanticism-to-deal-with-assertive-china-jaishankar/articleshow/106473061.cms,"India's External Affairs Minister, S Jaishankar, has said that a realistic approach is needed to deal with China, asserting that the relationship should be grounded in three key principles - respect, sensitivity, and interest. In an interview with ANI, Jaishankar discussed the importance of a pragmatic strategy to counter China's assertive actions, criticizing the romanticism of the Nehruvian era.

""I argue for dealing with China from a basis of realism -- that strain of realism, which I feel -- strains all the way from Sardar Patel to Narendra Modi -- that is the strain of realism which I feel should allow us to have a certain approach,"" said Jaishankar.

The External Affairs Minister commended Prime Minister Narendra Modi for adopting a practical approach towards China, aligning with the strain of realism rooted in Sardar Patel's principles. ""I would say that the Modi Government has been very much more and in conformity with a strain of realism, which originated from Sardar Patel,"" he stated.

Highlighting the disparity in the approaches of Sardar Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru, Jaishankar underlined their differing opinions. ""Even when it came, for example, to the UN Security Council seat, it's not my case that we should have necessarily taken the seat, it's a different debate, but to say that we should first let China -- China's interest should come first, it's a very peculiar statement to make,"" said Jaishankar, addressing the divergence in Nehru and Sardar Patel's realism.

Reflecting on the historical context of Sino-Indian relations, Jaishankar acknowledged the blend of realism and idealism in India's foreign policy towards China. He stated, ""It takes two hands to clap. I pose the issue in this manner if you look at the last 75 plus years of our foreign policy, they have a strain of realism about China and have a strain of idealism, romanticism, non-realism.""

Responding to queries about the possibility of improved relations between the two nations in 2024, Jaishankar delved into the concept of ""Chindia policy"". The alternative strain which starts from Nehru's China's first policy -- first let China take seat, then we will see for India. From China's first policy, it ends up as Chindia policy.""""Chindia"", an idea that projects the joint rise of China and India and was promoted by Congress leader Jairam Ramesh who called for constructive cooperation and competition between the Asian giants in 2014.

""You should ask the inventor of the term,"" said Jaishankar.

Addressing concerns about India's current stance on China, Jaishankar clarified, ""I don't believe it's a pivot we have taken, we have tried to construct a relationship which is based, as I say on three mutuals, and the fact is, unless that mutuality is recognized -- this relationship will find very difficult to progress.""

Emphasizing that India-China relations are guided by respect, sensitivity, and interest, Jaishankar concluded by acknowledging the importance of understanding the Chinese policy for the future of bilateral relations.

Earlier, 13 persons based in Pakistan and PoK were declared as proclaimed offenders by the special UAPA court in Doda. The police in Kishtwar termed the move as a significant step towards addressing the security challenges within the district.

""This significant move is attributed to the diligent efforts of the Kishtwar Police, which initiated the process by developing crucial intelligence and lodged an FIR in 2022. The investigation meticulously presented all formalities before the UAPA special court in Doda,"" SSP Kishtwar, Khalil Poswal, was quoted as saying.

The police informed that the process of attachment of property would be carried out under section 83 of CrPC ""if all the absconding terrorists subsequent to the declaration as proclaimed offenders don't surrender before the law within the time frame given by the court"".

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/if-you-want-to-make-money-and-generate-wealth-learn-to-stomach-volatility-as-well-ravi-dharamshi/articleshow/106476250.cms,"Ravi Dharamshi, CIO, ValueQuest Investment, says “when you start seeing prices reflecting FY26 or FY27 for that matter, that is when you should be getting worried. Valuations are about one standard deviation above the average. Can we get stressed to two standard deviations or higher? That is a possibility, but that is where one has to be worried about that.”

Dharamshi further says: “ A lot of cautiousness is required but I would say stay put, stay invested, enjoy the ride. You cannot enjoy the highs of the market without living through some corrections.”


Let us flash back to the beginning of 2023. We were grappling with rising interest rates in the US, rising inflation everywhere in the world, spiking energy prices, an ongoing war in Russia-Ukraine and you could have easily made a case that this year is going to be very volatile. But while what has panned out is something that none of us expected, which was a straight up line.

Clearly, markets do not go according to what we anticipate and there are two aspects to it. One is what the market is going to do and the other is what you should be doing. On what the market is going to do, again not being very prescriptive but what I feel is my reading of the setup is that it is a parabolic move that we are getting into. Like it or not that is how markets behave. We swing from one extreme to the other.

We swung to the one extreme during Covid times towards the low and we are now swinging towards the other extreme. Will that extreme point come at some point in this year? I would say there is a very high probability that is what will happen and then the market will find its reason to correct. What reasons will come up we do not know. The known ones obviously are the Fed and the elections and all those things but sheer valuations can also become reason for the markets to correct because markets tend to fall under its own weight.

All the known triggers for the current year are kind of getting factored into the pricing. So, fundamentally, it is becoming more and more difficult to justify deploying more capital. However, again, these things tend to last longer than expected. I would not be so brave to take a contract call that this is where it ends and this is how markets are going to correct and I will use that opportunity of that correction to deploy more money.

The smarter thing to do is just stay invested, clear up your portfolio, get rid of companies with corporate governance issues, understand what you own and why you own it because what happens is as my ex-boss used to say that the worst of mistakes happen in the best of times. So, we are entering a phase where we are in the best of times so the worst of mistakes are going to happen, so you want to guard against that. You do not want to lower your quality standards, you do not want to extrapolate something which is temporary into the future. There will be a lot of transitory wealth creators in this market and you want to understand what are the drivers of that and when those drivers cease to be the drivers of that particular wealth generation, you have to exit that.

So, a lot of cautiousness is required but I would say stay put, stay invested, enjoy the ride. You cannot enjoy the highs of the market without living through some corrections.


No, I do not think we are anywhere close to those absurd levels and there are three major peaks that we have seen in the markets. One was the 1992 Harshad Mehta peak, second was the 2001 dotcom peak and the third was just before the Global Financial Crisis and we are nowhere close in a lot of parameters whether it is profits as a percentage of GDP, whether it is ROE. It is an improving trend.

We are at 14-15% ROE. Our ROEs tend to peak between 20% and 22%. Our profits to GDP has peaked in the past at 7% corporate PAT to GDP. My hunch is this time we will exceed that because our corporate tax rates are lower. The new greenfield capex is happening at 15% tax rate. So, all that will get added. The business cycle momentum will surely continue for another three-four years is what I feel. However, markets might have moved a step higher and there might be a need for that correction for consolidation to happen at some point of time this year. I am not saying that the economy is going to have a tough time. It is the markets that would have run ahead of itself, that is a likely scenario this year.


There are some short hands to the valuations like market cap to GDP, but that is not a very strong predictor. But there are other things where the corporate earnings are getting factored two years, three years in advance. Order announcements are getting factored into the prices. All the positive triggers that we have kind of anticipated are getting factored into the price. When you start seeing prices reflecting FY26 or FY27 for that matter, that is when you should be getting worried. Valuations are about one standard deviation above the average. Can we get stressed to two standard deviation or higher? That is a possibility, but that is where one has to be worried about that.


So, there are two things to evaluate valuations in a very simplistic manner. One is the earnings and what are the drivers of those earnings and second is the multiple. People tend to look at multiples and get scared. But what we have to focus on is the earnings and the drivers of those earnings. Is there enough, is the growth engine firing on all cylinders? I would say no. There is still a rural consumer that is struggling. There is an export market that is struggling. It is not all optimism. There are pockets of optimism for sure.

So, there is still headroom in terms of growth. There is still headroom in terms of margin levers. For example, since the last five-six quarters, our gross margins have been improving, but the operating leverage which kicks in with the higher utilisation is yet to kick in. We are at about 75% utilisation. As soon as we start crossing 80%, that is when the operating leverage tends to kick in and the margin expansion can be very high. So, that lever is still there and the benefits of all the PLI schemes announced in the last two-three years are up ahead in the future.

In terms of profits and profitability, we have not peaked. Multiples assigned to the current earnings are at a very high level, but the absolute profits are for sure going to grow from here in the next two-three-year horizon. That tells us that one should stay focussed on the drivers of the profits and let markets do its thing in terms of valuation. I mean, I can never justify 60 multiple or a 70 multiple, but the fact of the matter is that these things tend to surprise us very positively and any exercise to pre-empt this is where market peaks usually tends to fall flat. So, we stay focussed on the drivers of profits and over there, I feel there is still a lot of headroom left in terms of profits growing.


Consumer discretionary can be put into many different buckets. So, for example, the real estate cycle is going strong and positively. The tourism cycle is growing strong and positively. But if you look at the bottom of the pyramid, the staples, that is not doing so well. So, there are various pockets which will do well over a period of time.

If India is going to be a $5 trillion economy from the current three-and-a-half trillion dollar economy and our corporate PAT to GDP is going to increase and our per capita GDP is also going to increase, the discretionary consumption boom still lies ahead of us. It will manifest itself segment by segment and we have to identify which are the ones that are going to lead from the next three-five years’ perspective. So, I feel over here, some of the capital intensive, tourism related companies are obviously factoring in a lot of positivity. But some of the other, bottom of the pyramid kind of consumption plays, is something that is struggling right now and those are the places….


For example, the QSR numbers are very weak and it is expected to be weak from the next two-three quarters’ point of view as well and this kind of a struggling environment, probably the valuations can reach a point where they can start looking attractive from the next three-five years’ point of view, so that is one thing that we would be very looking forward to. Second thing, probably in the beverages company also, there are some examples where there is no wealth creation that has happened in five-seven years’ time and the consumption…, these things tend to pick up.


: Alcoholic as well as some non-alcoholic also, but the point is that the consumption at the mass level is probably not yet manifesting itself and it is a theme that is much more secular in nature. So, these cyclical downturns are the time to be looking at them.


I strongly feel that India has neglected its manufacturing sector for the entire independent era. And this is the first time that a government has shown so much resolve in improving the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing has remained at 10-11% as a percentage of GDP since 1947. Can we go to 15%, 20%? Can we actually move the populace away from the agri and farm oriented economy towards manufacturing and urbanization oriented economy? I think that is definitely the intent and a lot of positive steps have been taken towards that. The ball has already started rolling.

What we are witnessing, and there are many multiple tailwinds. One is Atmanirbhar, but the second part of it is also exports from India and third is import substitution. So, all the three themes in manufacturing are playing out to varying degrees and to different extent in every sector, but it is reflecting in the order books. Order books are all three, four years kind of filled out for the future. So, the theme is strong and it will continue and the market has also recognized that and the stocks are pricing in a lot of that.

I am not suggesting for a moment that they are fantastic opportunities at this point of time and we can obviously have a correction at some point of time, but the theme will continue to do well even from here. You will have to find your entry point and I am not for a moment suggesting that there cannot be a correction but we have strong belief that this theme will continue and of course, there is some uncertainty around the election, if the government was to change the priorities can change. So, that is the risk we are carrying in some of these sectors.

So, you have to be cognizant of that, but it is a very small probability, but it is a probability and you have to build a portfolio beyond the election as well. You cannot be building a portfolio where a particular event can see the entire portfolio fall 40-50%. So, you will have to calibrate a little bit, build a mix of themes that are not dependent so much on government policies as well.


I wish I was that smart and I could time that to the precise saying that no this is where markets end and this is where markets should start correcting and I would want to be able to do that. I will just give you one anecdote where a very smart person called the Covid peak in February of 2020 and honestly at that point of time, none of us were speaking about Covid being such a large thing and he was right.

He sold out his entire portfolio and in a month's time, he was proven right, where the entire market was down 40%. However, three months down the line, every stock that he sold was above his price and he was never able to get in. I am not suggesting something like that is going to happen, but I am saying if you get the correction right, you will not get the entry point right. The smarter thing, the wiser thing to do is stay put, reduce the risk in your portfolio by getting rid of the lower quality names and expect some and lower your expectations. That is what I would say.


You see markets are designed to scare you out of your investments but in real estate do you think that way, when you bought or purchased a piece of land or a flat, you will hold it likely for 10-20 years, you are not going to sell because it has gone up 20%. So entering and exiting is not so easy in real estate. Now just because it is easy to do that in stock markets, the corollary to that is people tend to get shaken out of their investment far more than they should be. So sometimes valuations will be an issue, sometimes war will be an issue, but there will always be reasons why you should be selling out of your position. And the biggest risk that you carry is not participating when the markets are good, when the times are good. Yes, you have to keep your head and think rationally, but again most of the times not doing anything is the right action even when times look like they are a little on the optimistic side.


go back to what I mentioned earlier about the drivers of profits and profitability and you have to understand how large the opportunity is and does that company have the right to tap into that opportunity. If we are talking about the beginning of a trend, I will give you a slightly older example.


: No, no, I will give you a slightly older example. Imagine this is the early 90s, 94-95 and IT stocks are just about beginning to perform. Yes, you are in ‘95-96, where you know stocks have gone 3x, 4x, 5x and you are feeling scared about what is going to happen now and you sold out too early. Look at the kind of wealth that got generated subsequently. So was it the smart thing to have focused on the 95-96, that year's earnings number and multiple and say that, you know, one should be selling out or was it the smarter thing to just stay invested?

This is a longer term 10-year, 15-year trend and there is going to be a Foxconn out of India, a Honhai Precision or those kinds of companies will be built out of India and you might have actually gotten a chance to get into one early enough. So then ride the volatility, Titan did not become Titan without its share of corrections. It had more than two 50% corrections, it had more than 10, 20% corrections. So you want to make money, you want to generate wealth, then you have to develop the ability to stomach the volatility as well.


Yes, but look at it in context of the size of the economy, look at it in context of what is the entire profit pool of the manufacturing sector in India. It is barely $2-3 billion and look at and compare it with what it is where other countries have become a manufacturing hub, whether it is China or whether it is one of the Southeast Asian countries, they have all gone and grown in tens of billions of dollars, if not hundreds of billions of dollars. When that kind of a boom is coming into manufacturing, do you really want to second guess yourself and say, the multiples are looking too high, there is going to be a 20-30%, maybe 50% correction. And so I am going to play smart, sell right now and buy back later. It might so happen that the stocks run up initially from here.

These prices also might not be, you will not get an entry point at these prices also. I am not suggesting this is the time to be going headlong into the market. Clearly signs are optimistic, but I am not so smart to be able to judge this is where the markets peak.


Again, there are two parts to it. What the market will do and what we should be doing. We should be taking every step to ensure that you do not completely exit your position. So whether it is trimming your position, whether it is not deploying any more capital in that, so you do not want to be making the mistakes at this point of time, which make you regret later on. So you want to take some money off the table and that it is an option value more than anything else, where you actually hold on to the remaining part of your position for a much longer period. That is how you create that stomach to take the volatility because you know, at the back of your mind, you have made good money in it and build that worst case scenario out, if the market corrects 20% and your stock corrects 30-40%, will you be okay? If that is the answer to it, then you have reached a stage where you have the ability to hold on to it much longer. And then if market does provide that opportunity, then you can use that cash that you have generated to add more to the position."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/ashok-vaswani-assumes-charge-as-kotak-banks-md-and-ceo/articleshow/106459292.cms,"Mumbai: Ashok Vaswani on Monday took over as the managing director (MD) and CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank, succeeding Dipak Gupta, who served as interim MD and CEO after founder director Uday Kotak stepped down on September 2, 2023. Vaswani, 62, will have a term of three years.

Vaswani, a seasoned banker with experience at Barclays and Citigroup, is known for his role as a 'digital evangelist' at Barclays, where he pioneered digital banking, contributing to the bank's recovery after the 2008 financial crisis.

As a chartered accountant and company secretary, Vaswani played a key role in reshaping Barclays' retail strategy after the global financial crisis. He is also associated with introducing Europe to digital banking through the innovative 'Pingit' mobile payments service.

However, his return to lead Kotak Mahindra Bank comes with the challenge of ensuring management stability, scaling commercial banking, maintaining margins, and preserving a conservative culture, as reported earlier.

As Vaswani assumes the role of MD and CEO, industry observers are closely watching him as to how he navigates the bank's challenges, maintain profitability, and show growth in a competitive market. Kotak Mahindra Bank had reported a 24% increase in net profit to ₹3,191 crore in the second quarter, driven by a 23% rise in net interest income.

""All the different apps of the Indian Railways will be brought under the umbrella of this Super App,"" a senior government official told ET. ""This will improve user experience by reducing the number of downloads needed for a complete bouquet of railway services."" He said there is scope for better synergy and monetising the existing offerings. CRIS-the railway ministry's arm responsible for information technology (IT) systems-will be developing this super app.

Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), the primary online ticketing platform of the railways, relies on CRIS.

""The Indian Railways apps need an overhaul after taking user feedback into account,"" the official said.

The super app will combine the offerings on all the existing ones--- Rail Madad (for complaints and suggestions), UTS (booking unreserved train tickets), and National Train Enquiry System (train status) for commuters.

ET Bureau

PortRead (reading and writing radio tags), Satark (performing inspection reports), TMS-Nirikshan (inspecting geo-location-based track assets) for operations and another set of apps, including IRCTC Rail Connect (train ticket booking and cancellation), IRCTC eCatering Food on Track (getting food delivered to train seat), and IRCTC Air (flight ticket booking) could also be brought under the super app.

""While designing the super app, potential for monetisation of eyeballs must be kept at the forefront,"" another official said. ""Bringing the existing successful standalone apps to a common platform must create value.""

The app development and running it for three years will cost the national transporter about Rs 90 crore, according to the people cited earlier.

Among the Indian Railways apps, IRCTC Rail Connect is the most popular with more than 100 million downloads.

It is the only platform for rail ticket booking in the reserved category. UTS, the other popular railways app, has more than 10 million downloads and is focused on offering platform tickets and season passes. In FY23, Rail Connect registered 560,000 train tickets bookings, or about half the total tickets sold by IRCTC. The rest were from the IRCTC website.

Gypsy's revelation about her admiration for the pop icon unveils the profound impact Swift's songs had in helping her navigate the darkest chapters of her life behind bars.

Gypsy's Incarceration Origins
The contours of Gypsy Rose Blanchard's journey through the criminal justice system are rooted in her involvement in the murder of her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard. This gruesome act was the culmination of enduring years of abuse and trauma inflicted upon Gypsy, who was a victim of her mother's Munchausen syndrome by proxy. This mental illness involves a caretaker, often a mother, fabricating or inducing symptoms in a child to portray illness, as defined by Medline Plus.

Amid the complexity of Gypsy's life, her incarceration followed her participation in her mother's murder alongside her then-partner, Nicholas Godejohn. However, during the challenging prison years that ensued, Gypsy found an unexpected source of support in the music of global pop star Taylor Swift.

Gypsy's Transformation into a Swiftie
Gypsy Rose Blanchard's affinity for Taylor Swift transcended conventional fandom – it became a lifeline during her imprisonment. Despite the constraints of prison life, Gypsy, as reported by TMZ, dedicated funds from her father to acquire every album Swift released, including re-releases. Swift's music became a constant companion, offering Gypsy motivation and solace amidst the harsh realities of her incarceration.

Upon her release on parole, Gypsy harbored a strong desire to meet Taylor Swift, an aspiration she planned to fulfill during the Kansas City Chiefs' match against the Cincinnati Bengals in Missouri.

Unfulfilled Meeting with Taylor Swift
Despite gaining freedom on parole, Gypsy's dreams of meeting Taylor Swift encountered an unexpected obstacle. TMZ reported that Gypsy and her husband, Ryan Scott Anderson, received directives from her parole officer to leave Missouri, the state of her release. While the reasons behind this directive remain unclear, TMZ speculates it may be linked to perceived security risks in the Kansas City area.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard's unique connection with Taylor Swift's music underscores the transformative power of art in the face of adversity. Swift's songs served as a therapeutic anchor for Gypsy, providing a means to overcome the formidable challenges of prison life. As Gypsy navigates her post-prison life, the echoes of Swift's music continue to resonate as a testament to the resilience found in unexpected places.

FAQs:
Who is Gypsy Rose and what did she do?
Gypsy Rose Blanchard, the Missouri woman who convinced an online boyfriend to murder her mother after years of being coerced into pretending she suffered from leukemia, muscular dystrophy, and other serious illnesses, made her first appearance on social media since her release from prison.

Did Taylor Swift meet Gypsy Rose?
Gypsy Rose Blanchard has been 'denied' the opportunity to meet Taylor Swift, and the specific reasons for this lack of clearance remain undisclosed. TMZ has speculated that local law enforcement may be concerned about potential 'security risks' associated with her presence in the Kansas City area.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/metals-mining/cci-study-on-mining-sector-flags-iron-ore-pricing-export-issues/articleshow/106459511.cms,"The differential pricing of iron ore is likely to create competition concerns and exports of iron ore should also be discouraged, according to a study by fair trade regulator CCI. To ensure fair markets, the competition watchdog initiated a focused study on the mining sector, specifically iron ore in India, and its interconnected industries like steel.

The goal was to assess the competition perspective and determine if the iron ore market is functioning appropriately within the broader economic landscape.

In its market study on 'Dynamics of Competition in the Mining Sector in India With A Focus On Iron Ore', CCI has also flagged possible issues, with the pricing of iron ore from captive mines.

""The allocation of captive mines to some players creates entry barriers in the iron ore and steel sector as entry and successful operation becomes costly for new firms,"" the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said in a release.

As per the study, the differential pricing of iron ore for different end users is likely to create competition concerns.

The study observed that it is not possible to withdraw the already operational captive mines before the completion of their tenure as this could disrupt synergies and efficient production.

The amendments in mining law in 2021 have allowed the captive mines to sell up to 50 per cent of surplus iron ore in the open market, which is likely to boost the supply of iron ore in the market, the study said.

However, it noted that when a captive mine sells its surplus input to other entities, it is crucial to monitor the prices charged to ensure that it does not result in high costs for the buyer firm, especially if the buyer competes with a captive mine owned firm in the steel market.

""...exports of iron ore should be discouraged while simultaneously encouraging high value-added activities, including domestic production of steel, which will control the prices as well,"" CCI said.

To address the bottleneck in iron ore availability through e-auctions, the study suggested holding auctions weekly or bi-weekly, aligning with the business needs of the firms involved. This aims to enhance efficiency and accessibility in the iron ore market.

It also highlighted the importance of promoting sustainable mining by advocating rules that phase out 'dirty' technologies gradually.

The study emphasised the need for a clear regulatory framework to incentivise the adoption of clean technology and facilitate the transformation of production processes towards sustainability.

It has also recommended to ensure ease in implementing rules to alleviate the high cost of compliance for industry participants.

In the last few years, the competition watchdog has conducted several market studies in various sectors, such as e-commerce, telecommunication and pharma etc, CCI said.

These studies aimed to enhance understanding of market dynamics, bridge information gaps, and establish a robust intellectual foundation for competition rules.

The resignation was accepted by the assembly speaker Rabindranath Mahto.

Legislator of Gandey constituency, Ahmed is a three-time MLA, twice from Congress and now from JMM. He had joined JMM just before the assembly elections in 2019.

""I am not in Jharkhand at the moment. What I am getting to know is that he has cited personal reason for his resignation,"" JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya told ET.

With the resignation of Ahmed, speculation is rife that this could be the alternative plan that Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren is working on.

Soren has received seven summons by ED for questioning in an alleged land scam. However, he has not appeared a single time. Sources in JMM told ET that this could be the alternative plan in case the ED arrests him.

Soren can make his wife Kalpana Soren contest from the Gandey and could make her the CM in case he is arrested.

Hemant Soren's brother, Basant Soren, and sister-in-law Sita Soren are also sitting MLAs and there is ongoing feud between the family over control of the party. Sources tell ET that Hemant Soren might be fearing a possible challenge from Basant Soren and Sita Soren to control the party in case he gets arrested.

By putting his wife on the forefront, he can give a signal to the warring faction over control of the party and the government.

""All these are rumours planted by the opposition. There is no such thing,"" Bhattacharaya told ET.

BJP leader Nishikant Dubey took a dig at Ahmed's resignation.

""Jharkhand's Gandey MLA Sarfaraz Ahmed resigned from the assembly; resignation accepted. Hemant Soren ji will resign from the post of chief minister, the next chief minister of Jharkhand will be his wife Kalpana Soren ji. New year is going to be painful for the Soren family,"" Dubey wrote on X.

On extradition request to Pakistan to hand over 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed, MoS MEA Meenakashi Lekhi stressed that Hafiz Saeed was behind a lot of incidents that have happened in India.

""Everyone knows that Hafiz Saeed was behind the Mumbai attacks. A lot of incidents have happened in India and Hafiz Saeed was behind them as well,"" she told ANI

""India has maintained this since the beginning and he is also on the international list of terrorists, but despite that, Pakistan has never reacted to that,"" she added.

Lekhi further told ANI, that India has conveyed a request along with relevant supporting documents, to the Pakistan government to extradite him to India.

""But, now once again, we have conveyed a request along with relevant supporting documents to the Government of Pakistan to extradite him to India (to face trial in a particular case),"" she added.

The Ministry of External Affairs on Friday that India had conveyed a request to the Pakistani government regarding the extradition of the 26/11 attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed to India for facing trial in a particular case.

This comes after the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML), a political entity of Hafiz Saeed has fielded candidates for every national and provincial assembly constituency across Pakistan for the upcoming general elections slated to be held on February 8, 2024.

Hafiz Saeed's son Talha Saeed is also going to contest the polls from National Assembly's constituency NA-127, Lahore, while PMML's central president Khalid Masood Sindhu is taking part from NA-130, against Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz supremo and former PM Nawaz Sharif.

Allowing the radical outfits including Hafiz Saeed's son to contest polls in Pakistan, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi that Pakistan has been indulging in the mainstreaming of ""radical outfits"" as a part of its state policy, adding that India continues to monitor the situation as it has ""serious security implications"" for regional security.

Addressing the weekly briefing, Bagchi said, ""The person in question (Hafiz Saeed) is wanted in numerous cases in India. He is also a UN-proscribed terrorist. In this regard, we have conveyed a request along with relevant supporting documents, to the government of Pakistan to extradite him to India to face trial in a particular case.

Muhammad Hafiz Saeed, who has been in jail since July 17, 2019, for other charges, was sentenced in April 2022 by a special anti-terrorism court in Lahore, Pakistan, to a jail term of 33 years for ""financing terrorism.""

Despite being designated a terrorist by the UN and EU in the 2000s, Saeed was neither charged nor extradited over nearly two decades.

Saeed was designated as a terrorist by the United Nations Security Council in December 2008.

The top court has imposed a stay on the government decision allowing ex post facto environmental clearance, which permits projects to carry out operations without getting environmental clearances.

A bench of Justices B R Gavai and Sandeep Mehta issued a notice to the Ministry of the Environment and Forests (MoEF) on the plea filed by NGO Vanashakti.

In a post on X, former environment minister Ramesh said, ""The January 20, 2022 Office Memorandum of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, allowing for environmental approvals after a project had commenced was a disaster that had been foretold.""

— Jairam_Ramesh (@Jairam_Ramesh)

""It is only a partial relief that the Supreme Court has now put that absolutely atrocious Modi government decision on hold. The decision should actually be struck down completely,"" Ramesh asserted.

Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for Vanashakti, submitted that environmental impact assessment mandates prior approval before the commencement of any activity and allowing ex post facto environmental clearance was anathema to the Environment Protection Act.

The NGO, in its plea, said environmental impact assessment for a project can only take place before the commencement of activity and not after.

The plea challenged the validity of the office memorandum and sought a direction to the MoEF and state environment impact assessment authorities ""not to process and entertain any application for grant of ex post facto environment clearance.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/arbitrary-court-orders-summoning-govt-officials-contrary-to-constitution-sc/articleshow/106506050.cms,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday formulated a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to be followed by all High Courts while summoning government officials. A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) D Y Chandrachud cautioned the courts against humiliating government officials, summoning them arbitrarily or passing unnecessary comments on their attire.

The Bench, however, acknowledged the fact that the personal appearance of officials in summary proceedings for furnishing evidence. The Bench added that the courts should refrain from summoning the officials if the purpose can be achieved by filing affidavits.

The judgment added that an official cannot be summoned only because his or her view is different from the view of the court. The Bench however clarified that the personal presence of officials may be required if there is suppression of facts.

As regards comments passed by courts on the attire of officials, the apex court said that the courts must refrain from doing so unless there is violation of dress code of their own office.

It added that government officers should not be made to stand during the entire proceedings unless needed or asked to. The judgment further said that Courts must refrain from passing remarks or observations to humiliate such officers. For the future, the Supreme Court ordered that advance notice must be given before summoning the officials for adequate preparation. The court added that the first option for such appearance must be via video conference.

The directions were passed by the top court on a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government against the orders passed by Allahabad High Court last year to summon two senior government officers.

The High Court in one of the orders had also ordered the arrest of two senior IAS officers although they were released a day later after the Supreme Court's intervention.

On a nerve shredding day at Newlands, with the sun beating down on one of the world’s great sporting venues 270 runs were scored in 75.1 overs with 23 wickets falling.

Only once have more wickets fallen on an opening day, back when England played Australia in Melbourne in 1902. The next best, 22 sticks, also featured the same two teams, at the Oval in 1890. If sport is about glory, Mohammad Siraj can rest in the knowledge that he has written himself into Indian folklore. No Indian fast bowler can lay claim to sending down a more incisive single spell in the history of the game.

After losing the toss and being asked to bowl, Siraj had the red cherry from the Wynberg End and Rohit Sharma could not prise it away from his effervescent fast bowler, not that he would have wanted to.

Siraj hit the perfect lines and lengths, tormenting the top order. The outside edge was attacked relentlessly and with just the right of movement aligned with irresistible bounce. Aiden Markram was the first to nick off, having done some of the hard work. Siraj then brought the inside edge into play, getting one to rise on Dean Elgar, who could ride the bounce and chopped back onto his stumps.



Jasprit Bumrah trespassed briefly on Siraj’s symphony, having Tristan Stubbs caught close to the bat on the leg side off an inside edge.

From here on Siraj would not be denied. Tony de Zorzi tickled down leg to give KL Rahul an easy catch, David Bedingham gloved to third slip and Marco Jansen nibbled outside off. When Kyle Verreynne’s brief but unconvincing stay out in the middle was ended by Siraj, South Africa were 45 for 7 and Siraj had figures of 9-3-15-6. To bowl nine overs on the trot in the searing heat was an achievement in itself, but to make it count in this emphatic manner ensured that India had carved out the heart of the South African batting line-up.

South Africa eventually succumbed to 55 all out, with Mukesh Kumar picking up two wickets without conceding a run. Never has this team bowled out for fewer than 84 while choosing to bat first at home. It was also their lowest score since readmission to Test cricket, comfortably eclipsing the 73 at Galle in 2018.

When you bowl out the opposition for such a low score, it is only natural that the batsmen who have to play on the same pitch feel some uncertainty when it is their turn at bat. But, there was no evidence of this when Rohit Sharma settled in alongside Shubman Gill after Yashasvi Jaiswal was dismissed early.

Rohit was not only positive in trying to put the pressure on the bowlers, he was assured in defence when this was needed. Clarity of thought is a magical thing when you have the ability, temperament and quality that Rohit possesses. On a surface where the home team struggled, Rohit raced to 39 and added 55 for the second wicket before extra bounce defeated his defensive stroke.

Nandre Burger, bowling with his tail up, blasted out Gill (36) while Shreyas Iyer played a lose shot and India found themselves at 110 for 4. A lot rested on Kohli (46) and KL Rahul, but the wicketkeeper batsman attempted an uncharacteristic upper cut and nicked off on 153. The wheels then came off, with India losing their final six wickets without being able to add a single run.

If this was book cricket or one of those things played on a video game, you would consider the result unrealistic. And yet, India collapsed spectacularly, only managing 153. And yet, simply because South Africa had been so abject with the bat, India were well ahead of the game.

At one point, there was a serious risk that the Test would end on the first day itself, however improbable that sounds. Batsmen were constantly tested and there was enough in the pitch, even at the end of the day for India to reduce South Africa to 62 for 3 in their second innings.

When India start the second day, they still have 36 runs in the bank to play with. Unless a miracle happens, South Africa are in a position from which they cannot get out of jail.

It added that Rs 10,319 crore were siphoned off by criminals between April 2021 and December 2023.

Victims were also targeted using online investment fraud, illegal lending apps, sextortion and OTP forwards during the period, it said.

Most crimes originated from China, Cambodia and Myanmar and involved non-state actors, said the government body.

The law enforcement agencies were able to block Rs 1,127 crore belonging to 4.3 lakh victims, it added. However, returning money to the victims remains a big challenge as it involves a complex process and we are working on various models to expedite it, said I4C CEO Rajesh Kumar. He added that about 9-10% of the seized money have been returned so far.


The authorities blocked 295,461 fraud SIM cards, 2,810 websites, 595 mobile apps and 46,229 IMEIs used in these crimes. The national average of cyber complaints in 2023 was 129 per one lakh population. On average, more than 5,000 cyber complaints are registered per day. The number of complaints grew by 113.7% from 2021-2022, it added.

Out of 31 lakhs complaints on the online portal, only 66,000 FIRs could be registered by state police since April 2021. I4C is a body established by the Ministry of Home Affairs to provide a framework and eco-system for law enforcement agencies to deal with cybercrime in a coordinated manner.

Kumar said that regions near Delhi are using sextortion, online booking, OLX-related crimes to trick the victims. Gangs operating from Jharkhand, etc are using KYC expiry, Android banking malware-type scams to siphon off money from gullible individuals. He said other major cyber crimes are duping people of their money using investment applications and websites offering part-time jobs and ponzi schemes, illegal lending applications and customer care centres. There were also cases of android malware fraud by seeking OTPs to take control of the victims' computer systems, impersonation by taking over social media accounts and sextortion.

Another success, Kumar said, was when the external affairs ministry managed to bring back citizens from Myanmar, where they were taken in the lure of job opportunities and held back to commit cyber frauds."

This is the third unit of public sector major SAIL where the government has decided not to go ahead with the strategic sale. Earlier in 2019, it decided to halt the privatisation of Durgapur-based Alloys Steels Plant (ASP) while in 2022, the sale of Visvesvaraya Iron and Steel Plant (VISP) in Bhadravati, Karnataka, was called off citing a lack of interest from bidders.

In 2018, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the strategic sale of these three units of Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL). Accordingly, global Expressions of Interest (EoIs) were invited on July 4, 2019, by SAIL for SSP.

""Multiple EoIs had been received and bidders were shortlisted. However, due to the lack of interest of shortlisted bidders to proceed further with the transaction, the Government of India, with the approval of Alternative Mechanism (Empowered Group of Ministers) has decided to annul the current EoI thereby terminating the present transaction,"" the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) said on its website on Wednesday.

For the current fiscal, the government had budgeted to raise Rs 51,000 crore through CPSE disinvestment and strategic sale. So far, it has been able to mop up Rs 10,052 crore.

The West is a critical partner be it in investments, tourism, or mobility, Jaishankar pointed out at launch event of his second book, Why Bharat Matters, here on Wednesday evening.

The External Affairs Minister, who was in Russia for an important visit last week, further pointed that India can have equally strong ties with both the US and Russia based on its national interests.

On India's contribution to the international community as a force for global good, the minister noted that digital domain would be one where India would be most impactful. While he felt that 2024 will face turbulence, India will be in a confident position. The book delves into India's global aspirations and draws parallels with the Ramayana to offer insights into diplomatic strategies. Referring to it, Jaishankar talked about the Ramayana and the statecraft lessons it provides. Jaishankar said there are great diplomats in Ramayana and every Ram requires a Laxman. In Why Bharat Matters, Jaishankar argues while rising powers seek stability, India must plan to rise amidst unpredictability. This process is also exceptional as it representsthe rejuvenation of a civilizational state.

More middle-browers must enjoy the more recent La Casa de Papel, a.k.a. Money Heist, on Netflix.

But there is reason to be suitably impressed by the real-world heists that have become a trademark of heisters from Bihar.

The latest incident taking place in the last days of last year in Darbhanga district involves a whole pond being 'stolen'. What was earlier a public pond, complete with fishing amenities for locals, was filled in over 10-15 days by the local land mafia who saw a property price where once stood a water body. Bihar Police have not found these Pink Panthers.

Coming as this does on the tiptoeing footsteps of two other heists in 2022 - the first of a 60-ft long steel bridge that was dismantled Lego-style in Sasaram district, and the second of a diesel engine from a railway yard in Begusarai - should Bihar now monetise this skill set by opening an anti-thievery skilling centre?

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/insure/bank-assurance-sought-to-curb-misselling-of-insurance-products/articleshow/106524397.cms,"The government has sought suggestions from lenders on steps to curb misselling through banking channels as part of efforts to strengthen regulatory oversight of the bancassurance model, said people aware of the matter.

Bancassurance is a partnership between banks and insurance companies to sell insurance products through bank branches.

Some of the measures being considered may include a cap on commission charges paid to banks for selling insurance products, stricter disclosures of commission while selling policies, and delinking bank employees' performance appraisals from insurance sales targets, said the people.

Last month, financial services secretary Vivek Joshi held a meeting with chiefs of state-run banks over issues related to bancassurance, including its effectiveness in increasing insurance penetration and challenges in the form of misselling.
In 2022-23, the contribution of banks as corporate agents was 5.93% in non-life premiums and 17.44% in new business premiums for life insurance.

A senior bank executive said discussions are being held with all stakeholders, including the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) and both life and general insurance councils.

In October 2023, the IRDAI had set up a task force to review the existing banking intermediation model and carry out modifications in the regulatory framework. The committee is to submit its report this month.

""One suggestion is that there should be a cap of around 15% of the total premium on commissions and other charges paid to banks for selling insurance products,"" the executive said on condition of anonymity, adding that the government also wants proper disclosure while issuing policies on commissions and other charges paid to banks.

Last year, the regulator, under the IRDAI (Payment of Commission) Regulations, 2023, in order to enable and provide flexibility to insurers to manage their expenses within the overall limits based on their gross written premium, replaced the cap on commission payments with an overall cap on expenses of management (EoM) of insurers.

The maximum amount that can be incurred towards EoM is 30% of the gross written premium for that financial year. In the case of standalone health insurance companies, the limit is 35% of the gross written premium."

Hyderabad-based Dhruva Space, in a statement, said the successful testing of 'Launching Expeditions for Aspiring Payloads - Technology Demonstrator' (LEAP-TD) will help embark on its satellite mission.

The statement said Dhruva Space has validated the P-30 platform and its various subsystems in-orbit and the results were confirmed by reception of telemetry and beacon data at the ground station of the Thiruvananthapuram-based Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST).

""These subsystems include On-Board Computer, Ultra High Frequency (UHF) TT&C Module, Beacon in UHF, Attitude Control System with a Reaction Wheel from Comat, and Power Distribution Board,"" the Dhruva Space statement read.

ISRO's PSLV Orbital Experimental Module (POEM) enables in-orbit scientific experiments using the spent PS4 stage as an orbital platform.

The Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) announced the successful testing of India's first high performance green propulsion system for small satellites developed by Bellatrix Aerospace, which was supported by the Technology Development Fund of the DRDO.

""The developed technology is environmentally safe, reducing cost of satellites and will be key technology boosting Indian space capabilities,"" the DRDO said on X.

The qualification of the LEAP-TD has now paved the way for hosted payload solutions for space missions, that allows persons other than the satellite's primary operator to own a portion of the spacecraft such as a sensor, an instrument or a set of transponders.

""The first LEAP satellite mission (LEAP-1) has already been conceived and is slated to be launched soon,"" the start-up said.

The hosted portion of the satellite operates independently of the main spacecraft, but shares the satellite's power supply, transponders, and in some cases, ground systems.

""Dhruva Space's hosted payload offering enables reduced timelines and rapid access to Space; shared operations, development and launch; significant cost savings; considerable risk reduction; and various levels of payload command and control through Dhruva Space's Telemetry, Tracking and Command (TT&C) ground facilities,"" Sanjay Nekkanti, Chief Executive Officer, Dhruva Space, said.

The POEM platform of ISRO allows space startups, university students and research institutes to carry out in-orbit tests of their experiments.

The platform is hosted on the stage four of the PSLV rocket, which otherwise would have remained in orbit for some time before crashing into the sea, after placing the satellite in desired orbit.

POEM has standard interfaces and packages for power generation, telemetry, tele-command, stabilisation, orbit keeping and orbit manoeuvring and hence can be used to design, develop and validate experimental payloads.

ISRO's PSLV-C58 rocket was placed into orbit XPoSAT -- developed by the Bengaluru-based Raman Research Institute -- on January 1."

The HSBC India purchasing managers’ index of manufacturing eased further to 54.9 in December compared with 56 in the previous month. However, the easing had no impact on optimism, as the year-ahead outlook rose to a three-month high.

“India’s manufacturing sector continued to expand in December, although at a softer pace, following an uptick in the previous month. Growth of both output and new orders softened, but on the other hand, the future output index rose since November,” said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist, HSBC.

A reading of over 50 signifies expansion.
The third quarter of FY24 also marked the lowest PMI reading of 55.5 for any quarter since Q1 of FY23. A double digit increase in manufacturing output had lifted growth in the second quarter to 7.6%. The GDP growth is likely to ease to 6.3% in the second half of the year compared with 7.7% in the first half.

Experts indicate further easing in PMI in coming months.

“There may be some further easing in momentum, as external demand remains weak, which may weigh on domestic manufacturing activity. Domestic demand however remains,” said Rahul Bajoria, MD & Head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics, Barclays.

The 400 manufacturers participating in the survey also reported a slowing down of new business, as they noted a decline in demand for certain products.

“The rate of expansion softened to the weakest since October 2022 even as it remained above its long-run average,” the release stated.

The growth in export orders also hit its joint-slowest pace in eight months, even as firms recorded gains from Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North America.

The easing of business activity also contributed to employment remaining largely stable in December.

However, there were some gains visible on the cost front. The charge inflation outpaced input inflation for the fourth consecutive month, providing better pricing power to firms.

“Survey participants that hiked their fees in December mentioned the pass-through of recently absorbed cost burdens to clients,” the release said.

The rate of input inflation fell to its second-weakest level in nearly three and a half years, with firms reporting increases in prices of chemicals, paper and textiles.

Lower levels of input inflation is expected to provide respite, keeping core CPI inflation lower.

“The major story emerging out of December PMI print is stable input-price pressures. This is in line with core CPI inflation in November, which moderated to the lowest level since March 2020, and we expect it to remain soft in the near term,” Bajoria said."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/why-16th-finance-commission-must-think-innovatively-about-fund-allocation/articleshow/106524135.cms,"Path dependence can impede development because it often leads to resistance to change and innovation. Institutions may continue to follow outdated practices because 'that's the way it's always been done', missing out on opportunities for improvement. Consider the case of the Swedish warship, Vasa. In 1628, Vasa, adorned with heavy artillery, sank on its maiden voyage.

The disaster occurred partly because of a path-dependent adherence to traditional shipbuilding techniques that couldn't support the heavy artillery. The recently constituted (FC) must avoid the 'Vasa syndrome' of sticking to precedents at the cost of progress.

There are three critical areas in which the 16th FC must diverge from its predecessors' path:


Initially, the 14th FC proposed an augmentation of states' share in vertical devolution from 32% to 42%. The 15th FC adjusted the vertical devolution to 41% of the divisible tax pool. This reduction accounted for the bifurcation of J&K into two UTs.

The 16th FC faces a formidable challenge. Is 41% the appropriate allocation, or does it warrant an increase or decrease? Shouldn't all central cesses be abolished if it is to be reduced, as a quid pro quo for states' acceptance?

In his 'Note of Dissent', the late Abhijit Sen, a part-time member of the 14th FC, outlined reasons for advocating a states' share of 38% in the divisible pool of taxes, instead of the proposed 42%.

Sen acknowledged the commission's significant shifts, including a substantial increase in tax devolution and steps towards 'cooperative federalism', which he supported. However, Sen expressed concern about the implications of these changes, particularly the strain on the Centre's net tax resources, which would shrink by nearly 1% of GDP.


The Constitution mandates FCs to propose measures to augment the consolidated fund of a state, enhancing the financial resources of panchayats and municipalities based on commissions' (SFCs) recommendations. However, Union FCs, beginning with the 10th, have disbursed funds to local bodies without substantive inputs from SFCs.

10th FC granted ₹4,380.93 crore to panchayati raj institutions, and ₹1,000 crore to urban local bodies.

11th FC increased these grants by 50%, in the absence of recommendations by several SFCs. Critically, it underlined the failure of many SFC reports to adhere to constitutional mandates. Further, the composition of SFCs was questioned, with concerns about their autonomy and the ability to make independent recommendations. This pattern of disregard for state-level inputs persisted, with subsequent commissions like the 12th and 13th also relying on ad-hoc measures without solid SFC recommendations.

Structural and operational challenges faced by SFCs have impaired their effectiveness. Many states have not established SFCs, leading to a lack of financial oversight and guidance for local bodies. These SFCs, when constituted, often grapple with resource constraints and delayed report submissions. There is also a failure of states to act on SFC reports or to release allocated funds.

This raises a question for the 16th FC. Should it continue granting funds to local bodies in states that have neglected their constitutional obligations regarding SFCs? FCs are not legally required to distribute grants to local bodies directly but to recommend strategies for augmenting the consolidated fund of a state.


States that are not fiscally disciplined often fail to increase their revenue. The 15th FC addressed this by introducing a 'tax effort' criterion in horizontal devolution, assessing states based on their tax collection efficiency relative to their GDP. However, this criterion only carried a 2.5% weightage.

This leads to a dependency issue, raising questions about whether states should be encouraged to boost their revenue. Some states make poor fiscal choices, relying on FCs for support. For example, despite receiving 74% of its revenue from GoI, Bihar chose to lose revenue through prohibition. The 16th FC should address irresponsible financial behaviour and emphasise fiscal reforms, marking a shift from previous FCs' approaches.

Thus, in confronting historical inertia, the 16th FC must be courageous. It's imperative to break from past complacencies and boldly address fiscal irresponsibility and outdated practices. This requires a radical rethinking of , support for local governance and incentivising fiscal prudence.

Further, since FC needs to consult all states, especially for grants-in-aid, the timeline to submit its recommendation by October 2025 will be tight. Another ticklish issue would be that of population, in the absence of the latest census, the question of which census figures does the FC use? And how will it incentivise states that have worked on population control?

The commission's willingness to innovate and challenge the status quo will be pivotal in shaping a more resilient India."

The global investment banking firm noted that even though growth is expected to slow down in the coming fiscal to 5.6% from 6.7% projected in FY24, mass consumption may rise as easing price pressures support mass consumption.

""With inflation expected to moderate to 4.5% in FY25 from 5.6% in FY24, the replenishment of savings that got exhausted during the pandemic for rural households, additional liquidity driven by pre-election spending, and a likely stable regime are all likely to support a pick-up in rural volumes that remained below par through 2023,"" it said.

The agency also pointed out that rural wages running higher than rural inflation are also to play a role in supporting consumption, which witnessed a nascent recovery in 2023. ""Organised firms have highlighted that rural demand remained weak in 2023; however, industry data indicates that rural volumes have seen a sequential improvement since 4QFY23, it said.

By refusing to transfer the ongoing Sebi probe to a special investigation team (SIT), the apex court has backed the domain authority of the markets regulator and reposed faith in it to see the matter to a conclusion. Any closure, as the court reminded, to the ongoing investigation would come after completes its investigations, for which it has now got an extended deadline by three months. The bench saw no reason to find the regulator being lax in its investigations. In fact, it added that there were no valid grounds to direct Sebi to revoke its amendments on foreign portfolio investments (FPIs) and (LODRs) on account of this probe. In other words, the apex court has not spotted anything hanky-panky.

The market, a compass, if anything, of the wisdom of crowds, reacted to the verdict positively. The group's market cap at the end of Wednesday was ₹15.1 trillion, gaining ₹63,795 crore on a single day, up from ₹14.47 trillion the day before the verdict. A key question in the ongoing probe is about the beneficial ownership of the foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) that are stakeholders in the companies. Sebi has been asking FPIs to disclose their beneficial ownership. Transparency encourages probity and the regulator should double down along this path.

There is a big difference between allegations of any infraction by law on short-selling and short-selling per se. The latter is legit, the former isn't. The court has underlined this vital difference and directed Sebi to confirm which of the two applies to the Adani group of companies. Allegations, being like helium-filled airships, can be flammable. But Wednesday's court verdict shows that, on evidence, Adani is flying safe."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/speaking-tree/willpower-is-a-skill/articleshow/106524499.cms,"As we usher in the New Year, the tradition of making resolutions rekindles. However, the ardour with which we embark on this journey often dissipates swiftly, leaving us perplexed because of our inability to sustain the winning spirit. The crux of this dilemma lies in understanding behavioural dynamics between the planning and execution phase, to enable a proactive and pragmatic approach while deciding upon positive affirmations to experience the 'Eureka' moment.

At the core of numerous obstacles, lack of 'willpower' emerges as the most critical factor that can either propel us to success or leave us floundering in defeat. The Chhandogya Upanishad emphasises the concept of willpower during Sanat Kumar's dialogue with Narad. In the Bhagwad Gita, Krishn in 'Vishwaroop Darshan Yog' urges Arjun to harness willpower to conquer his foes.

From a neuroscientific lens, willpower is a skill honed through conscious effort. Practices such as positive self-talk, meditation, mindfulness and prayers can sculpt the neural mechanisms crucial for robust willpower.

So, let us ensure that the demonic forces within do not subjugate our willpower; instead, let the divine forces govern our lives, as expounded in the Bhagwad Gita chapter on the Yog of the Division of Divine and Demonic Nature. May the New Year herald a soulful beginning where the resonance of willpower echoes in our every endeavour as 'Spirit ignites the spark, willpower fans the flame'."

When you see a streak of sunlight, all things become blissful. Foggy mornings turn into melted miracles. Photos are clicked and shared as if this was, in the words of Cat Stevens' old song, 'Morning has broken/ Like the first morning'. Calls are made to friends and relatives flying out of the city - 'Saw sunlight?!'

Kejriwal on Wednesday skipped for the third time the summons issued by the Enforcement Directorate in the Delhi excise policy case. The AAP alleged that the repeated notices were part of a conspiracy to arrest him and stop him from campaigning in the Lok Sabha polls.

Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh -- like Kejriwal -- also used to call ED notices wrong but had to appear before the agency. Today, despite efforts, let alone getting bail, they are getting reprimanded in every court, said Virendra Sachdeva, the BJP's Delhi unit chief.

""The way Kejriwal is avoiding the ED summons clearly shows that he does not have faith in the administrative and judicial system of the country and, after that, the question arises whether he has any moral ground left to remain the chief minister,"" he alleged.

If Kejriwal finds the ED notices wrong, he should go to the courts but he will not do that, the BJP leader claimed.

The BJP leader said Kejriwal should explain how the notice served to him in the same case on the basis of which Sisodia and Singh are in jail can be legally wrong.

Kejriwal earlier skipped the ED's summonses for November 2 and December 21, calling those ""illegal"" and ""politically motivated"". On Wednesday, he sent a written reply to the agency, calling the notice illegal.

The AAP asserted that Kejriwal was ready to cooperate with the agency but claimed that the summons was sent with the intention of arresting him.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself contests from the state and that keeps UP in the limelight throughout the elections. In an election year, UP is not only going to be talked about, but will also set the national narrative through the Ram Temple inauguration. The Opposition Samajwadi Party, Congress and the RLD are trying to play on caste and local sentiments to create obstacles in BJP's march. There are others like BSP which, despite having a decent vote share, are sitting on the fence. Smaller parties have largely gravitated towards the BJP.

BJP LOOKS TO STRENGTHEN NUMBERS

In 2014, the BJP won 71 of the 80 seats in UP with a 42% vote share. Two seats were won by BJP ally Apna Dal. In 2019, BSP, SP and RLD came together to give a fight to the BJP. Even then, the party won 62 seats with a bigger margin taking the vote percentage to 50%. In 2024, the BJP aims to do even better than 2014. The inauguration of the Ram Temple is a factor the party hopes to work in its favour.

The party has started working early, identifying seats it never won in UP and those which it lost in 2019. As per party sources, the BJP has increased its voter base by 20 lakh in the state with special focus on constituencies where it lost in 2019. The party is planning to announce candidates much earlier on seats it didn't win in 2019. The strategy worked for the party during the recent assembly elections, and it wants to repeat it in the upcoming Lok Sabha.

""It's not that we are going to the people because of the election. Every BJP worker remains in touch with the people throughout the year. We are always election ready,"" UP BJP president Bhupender Singh Chaudhary told ET. Chaudhary talks about several development projects being executed in UP. ""UP has changed under the leadership of PM Modi and the people trust Modi and BJP,"" he says.

After the UP assembly elections 2022, smaller parties like Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) have also gravitated towards the BJP.

The programmes of PM Narendra Modi and other senior leaders have already started. On January 22, Modi will inaugurate the Ram Temple. The party cadre has been instructed to keep the temple momentum high till the Lok Sabha polls.

INDIA ROAD BLOCK

The Samajwadi Party (SP), Congress and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), which are part of the INDIA bloc are in seat-sharing discussions. Although it fell short of victory, the SP was the biggest gainer in the 2022 assembly polls, with its voteshare jumping from 10% to 32% -- more than what it got in 2012 when it formed the government in the state with a majority. This has stood the party and chief Akhilesh Yadav in good stead to be the virtual showrunner of the INDIA bloc's play in UP.

For the SP, the 2024 LS polls will also be a prelude to the 2027 UP polls. Yadav has carried out some crucial changes. Sudhir Panwar, party spokesperson and analyst, said the SP has now been organised as a cadre-based party in the last one year, like the BJP and the BSP, and has a formal organisation now. In the absence of the BSP in the INDIA bloc, Akhilesh Yadav has coined the slogan 'PDA' -- Picchda Dalit Alpsankhyak -- and is trying to make inroads among BSP voters. Issues like social equality, caste census and unemployment form the core of the party campaign. The party is currently working on its candidate selection, with surveys going on and Akhilesh Yadav personally supervising the process. From its heydays of winning 35 and 23 seats in the 2004 and 2009 polls, respectively, the SP has individually won only five seats in the last two polls. It lost Azamgarh and Rampur in the by-polls with the party currently having only three MPs in the Lok Sabha.

For the Congress, the fight in UP is one of prestige. In the state where the Nehru-Gandhi family has its roots and two of its most high-profile bastions, the party in 2019 managed to retain only one seat -- Raebareli -- while Amethi was taken away from Rahul Gandhi in a humiliating defeat by the BJP. In 2022, its decline continued and it polled a meagre 2.33% voteshare, winning only two seats. Now, even as it claims support from the minorities and is strategically trying to consolidate a formidable 40% Dalit-Muslim support, it is an uphill task for the party to re-establish itself as an option for the state's voters, given its all but wiped-out presence and BJP's overwhelming popularity. Its role is more of a supporting player as the decision on the number of seats the party is going to contest is yet to be finalised.

The 2022 UP assembly polls resurrected the RLD which had virtually slipped into political oblivion after failing to win any seats in both 2014 and 2019 elections, with founder Ajit Singh and Jayant Chaudhary too losing their seats to the BJP. The party could win 8 out of the 33 seats it contested in 2022 in alliance with the SP -- a small but significant boost. Naturally, it aims to have some elected representation in Delhi while it also wants to get back its state party status. The challenge for Jayant Chaudhary is to keep his Jat community vote intact. The BJP is not the biggest challenger but time and again Jat community voters have gravitated towards the BJP especially in the Lok Sabha polls.

THE FADING BSP

The BSP, which has so far maintained equal distance from NDA and INDIA, will face a difficult challenge in stopping its eroding voteshare in the 2024 LS battle. It won 10 seats in alliance with SP and RLD in 2019 after a no show in 2014.

While SC voters remain the party's main base, its support among the MBCs are referred to as ""stepney votes"" in the BSP circle. Most of the party's prominent faces, who are popular among their caste men particularly MBCs, have already left the BSP and joined SP. The BSP is confronted with two major challenges ahead of the 2024 LS elections. It is but natural for the BSP to first keep its SC votes intact. The second task is to look for young faces among the MBCs to put up a good show in the 2024 battle for 80 seats in UP.

However, both tasks are difficult for the party in the current political situation. Mayawati's decision to select Akash Anand as her political heir is clearly aimed to woo young voters among the SCs. The party is struggling to protect its core SC voters from its political rivals. MBC voters like Rajbhars, Shakya, Saini and Nishad, are wooed by both the camps -- NDA and INDIA bloc.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/nba-trade-deadline-what-you-need-to-know/articleshow/106524156.cms,"NBA is gearing up for trade deadline which will be on February 8. All 30 National Basketball Association sides will look to bolster their squads as they are aiming for play-off spots.

Leading up to the deadline, teams engage in player trades as a strategic move to amass additional draft picks. Within this dynamic, various considerations come into play, including identifying potential trade targets, evaluating contracts with significant value, and dealing with contracts that pose challenges in terms of being moved. This multifaceted approach reflects the intricate nature of team management and player transactions in the basketball landscape.

The Boston Celtics currently hold a trade exception worth $6.2 million, along with the flexibility of up to eight second-round picks and an available roster spot. On the other hand, the Brooklyn Nets boast a significant arsenal with five first-round picks acquired from other teams, four of which are unprotected.

In a hypothetical trade involving Zach LaVine, the Los Angeles Lakers would likely need to part ways with three or four players. Meanwhile, the Memphis Grizzlies possess the capability to trade as many as four first-round picks and have both a $7.5 million trade exception and a $6.3 million disabled player exception at their disposal. These strategic elements highlight the diverse assets and considerations that NBA teams navigate in the dynamic landscape of player trades and transactions.

FAQs:
Q1. When is NBA trade deadline?
A1. NBA trade deadline is on February 8.

Q2. What is the full form NBA?

The London-headquartered bank cautioned that weak global growth in the medium term, further fractures in global supply chains and increasing protectionism could challenge the strategy by limiting the potential for trade expansion. India has been a key beneficiary of the ""China+1"" strategy and the tech-intensity of exports is gradually increasing, Barclays said. India's export-complexity index rank improved to 41 in 2023 from 46 in 2001, but compared with emerging market peers such as China (ranked 25) and Mexico (23), there is clearly a long way to go, it said.

""The biggest policy push is seen in manufacturing exports, where India is slowly yet steadily moving up the value chain, and seeing greater diversification. Still, India's largest goods exports themselves are highly reliant on imports,"" said Rahul Bajoria, managing director, Barclays.

To reduce certain critical dependencies, the government has launched production-linked incentives, with ""mixed success"", the report said, while highlighting that growing and sustaining exports is necessary to boost medium-term growth and economic stability.

In line with these goals, guidelines for transitioning vessels - already plying India's inland waterways - to clean energy will soon be readied, shipping, ports and waterways minister Sarbananda Sonowal told ET.

""Guidelines for the green transition of inland waterway vessels will be introduced during the first meeting of the Inland Waterway Development Council (IWDC). The initial target is to support transition of 1,000 vessels, ferries and boats over the next 10 years under the programme,"" he said. This first is scheduled for January 8.

According to Sonowal, the existing ferries that largely run on diesel will be encouraged to switch to green energy such as electric, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and hydrogen fuels. Officials estimate the project to cost ₹15,000 crore. A scheme for the same is being planned and it will fund transition of both state government-owned vessels and private ones. States such as Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and West Bengal own vessels and stand to benefit from the green transition programme. ""The scheme will operate like a Viability Gap Funding (VGF) to help the switch towards cleaner fuel for inland waterway transport,"" a senior government official told ET.
Besides this, a River Cruise Tourism Roadmap 2047 will also be released during IWDC. ""Ten international river cruises using Indo-Bangladesh protocol routes have been successfully completed,"" Sonowal said. These follow the World's Longest River cruise which was conducted from Varanasi on National Waterway-1 to Dibrugarh on National Waterway-2 via Indo-Bangladesh protocol route, covering 3,200 kilometres.

""The roadmap has identified 30+ additional potential routes for different river cruise types, including long and short, recreational and heritage segments to attract all tourist categories,"" Sonowal said. ""A 19-point action plan and roadmap, including route development, marketing strategy, infrastructure development and navigation to effectively proceed with developing such additional river cruises is also ready,"" he added. The IWDC will be the apex advisory body for the development of the inland waterway sector in the country. Its role will be similar to the Maritime State Development Council (MSDC) which focuses on development of ports and coastal states."

However, nothing of that sort happened and the meeting turned out to be a show of strength for Soren.

The meeting took place at the CM's residence in Ranchi where MLAs from Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) - all part of the ruling alliance - came together. A total of 43 MLAs joined the meeting. Two MLAs from Congress and JMM each were absent due to personal reasons.

The speculation started after JMM MLA Sarfaraz Ahmed from Gandey resigned as MLA on Monday. Ahmed too was present during the meeting and every MLA greeted him with applause when he came to attend.

While the reason for his resignation is still unclear, JMM sources said it has been done to have a safe seat in case the political situation demands so. Soren has not appeared before ED even after the agency issued seventh summons to him in a land case. Ahmed could get a Rajya Sabha nomination later this year.

All MLAs reposed their trust in Soren's leadership. ""We all said that Hemant Soren is our chief minister and he would continue as CM going forward,"" Congress MLA Pradeep Yadav told media persons after the meeting in Ranchi.

Soren is said to have told MLAs that they need to stay together. ""It is this unity which will ensure the success for the alliance in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls,"" he said.

In September 2022, the then governor Ramesh Bais took a long time to decide on his case related to the office of profit. Soren held a special session of the assembly and proved majority in the House in an apparent show of strength.

Sources told ET that there was no discussion on seat-sharing among the INDIA partners. ""That meeting will take place. It was not the subject of the legislative party meeting,"" said an MLA who attended the meeting.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/decoding-gdp-estimates-six-iterations-in-three-years-but-is-it-necessary/articleshow/106523984.cms,"Each sequential release of GDP estimates by MoSPI generates considerable excitement. Yet, many are unaware that each year's estimates are revised six times over three years before they are finalised. For example, the first estimate of growth for 2023-24, the First Advance Estimate (FAE), is expected to be released this week. A Second Advance Estimate (SAE) will be released at the end of February, and a (PE) in end-May.

These three 'early estimates' would then be followed by annual revisions spanning nearly three years.


Thus, as per the current practice, the final estimates for GDP and are available only three years after the end of a specific fiscal year.

This practice raises questions.


To answer these questions, we analysed data for four recent years for which all six estimates are available.


Three features of the various estimates stand out from this analysis, leading to three corresponding recommendations.

Given the limited time in the interregnum between FAE and SAE, the two estimates are similar. In two of the four years, the two estimates were identical. SAE was upgraded by 0.1 percentage point in one year and downgraded by 0.2 percentage points in another year.

This pattern lends to the recommendation that FAE and SAE should be merged into one estimate. One may release these numbers as the Advance Estimate in February when SAE is released as per the current process.

Once all data available up to two years after the end of the fiscal year has been utilised to prepare SRE, very little new information is available in the subsequent year. Therefore, unsurprisingly, SRE and TRE are similar.

As can be gleaned from the accompanying table, SRE and TRE were identical in one of the four years. TRE was upgraded by 0.1 percentage point in one year and by 0.2 percentage points in another year, and was downgraded by 0.2% in one year. These revisions have not only been minor but in the medium term, they mostly even out, because of which the size of the economy is not impacted in any specific direction.

Therefore, doing away with TREs would be largely inconsequential for the accuracy of the estimates, but it would, instead, make the process shorter, nimbler and more streamlined.

A final recommendation would be to combine FRE and SRE into one estimate. GDP estimates are revised significantly between these two estimates. SRE, underpinned by more detailed information, is more accurate than FRE. It would, thus, be prudent to release the combined estimate at an appropriate time between the two currently designated periods. If the data collection and its compilation can be accelerated, one could perhaps achieve a reliable revised estimate about 14-15 months after the fiscal year has ended.

A transition step may go to four estimates first by eliminating FAE and TRE, and subsequently go to three estimates by merging FRE and SRE within two years.

The final slate would then look like this: an Advance Estimate, a Provisional Estimate, and a Revised Estimate. All three estimates would be available within 16 months. Simple, precise and agile.

According to the 'Mirror', in an engineering examination, half of the students left the room to use the bathroom, far more than usual. It was suspected that most of the students were looking up answers on their phones. However, there was a question that was not related to what they had been taught in the class. It had two parts, part A was easy, but they didn't know how to do part B, so they left it blank as it only accounted for 5 marks out of 100.

Use of Internet in exam
But some students were clever and they tried to search for the answer on the Internet. The teacher posted the wrong answer on the internet and the students copied that answer. The teacher wrote on Reddit, ""He purposely made part B impossible to solve, and about a month before the final he got a teaching assistant to ask the exact question [online], which was distinctly worded to be unique.""

Teacher posts wrong answer
The teacher later revealed that he created his account and answered the question with a wrong solution that seemed right at first glance, but was fundamentally flawed and very unlikely that someone would make the same assumptions and mistakes independently.

His trick succeeded as out of 99 exams, 14 students copied the fake answer their teacher had posted online. They all got zero marks and were reported for breaking the rules. Their names were also spread to other teachers as cheaters. But the honest students got full marks for the trick question.

People praise teacher
Reacting to this action, a man called it 'amazing'. He said that he had seen some stories like this and it always made him glad that he did not use the internet for tests. Another person called it a 'genius' and said that he did not think that Google would be used to search for the answer in the exam.

FAQs:
What did the teacher do to catch the cheating students?
The teacher created his account and answered the question with a wrong solution that seemed right at first glance but was fundamentally flawed. Fourteen out of 99 students copied the flawed answer and got zero marks.

What did the students do when they could not answer a trick question?
Half of the students taking the examination left the room and went to the bathroom to find the answer on the internet. They copied the wrong answer posted by the clever teacher on the internet. But others left the answer unanswered.

Come 2024, even if global spillovers create volatility, the runaway depreciation of the Rupee may not happen as narrowing deficit have made the currency resilient, say economists.

The post-pandemic rise in exports has buffered India's current account balance, particularly since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, notes a report by Barclays Capital. Despite the steep surge in commodities such as crude oil, natural gas, vegetable oil, and fertilisers on which India is heavily dependent, the current account deficit was a manageable 2% in FY22-23. “ Reduced current account financing and improved capital flows have added to the economy's macro stability, a far cry from its categorisation as one of the ""Fragile Five"" economies a decade ago” said Rahul Bajoria .

India’s external vulnerability remains low as import cover (measured as months of imports that FX reserves can fund) remains comfortable at around 11 months compared to 7 month imports in 2012-13. Even foreign exchange reserves as a share of external debt of 99% is at its highest level in the last 10 years (excluding during the pandemic) compared to 71 percent in 2012-23 prior to the taper tantrum that escalated in September 2013 .

The Reserve Bank is also equipped with a strong armoury of foreign exchange reserves of over $ 600 billion to defend the rupee compared to $292 billion in 2012-13 adding to the market perception that RBi is being extra vigilant. “ In our view, the RBI is keeping liquidity conditions tight to protect the economy and the currency from undue volatility given the financial risks brewing globally” wrote Neelkanth Mishra, chief economist at Axis bank in his outlook for 2024.

Axis Bank expects CAD to remain at 1-1.5% of GDP in the next two years. “ The rupee’s Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) has been remarkably stable over the past five years as the RBI has dampened volatility. Such has been the extent of volatility management, that this year the INR has been less volatile against the USD than even against the CNY” Mishra wrote.

Goldman Sachs is also forecasting a narrower current account deficit for India in 2023 and 2024 on the back of lower oil price forecasts from $86/bbl (average) to $84/bbl in 2023 and fromabove $90/bbl (average) to $81/bbl in 2024, and services exports surprising higher than prior expectations

Ind-Ra expects the current account deficit to narrow down to 1.3% of GDP in FY24 (FY23: 2.0%), in response to the evolving domestic and global demand conditions. Flows in the capital account are estimated to improve to USD73.8 billion in FY24 from USD58.9 billion in FY23. As a result, there would be a net addition of USD29.8 billion in the forex reserve in FY24 (excluding cross currency valuation gain/loss). Ind Ra expects this to help the Indian rupee to average 83.05/USD in FY24, and the RBI’s intervention in the forex market to keep a lid on the rupee volatility.

“The expected reversal in Fed policy stance, India’s inclusion in J P Morgan bond indices, and the slowdown in the developed economies is expected to induce higher capital flows to India unless there are new geo-political risks and surprises in the upcoming Indian election outcomes “ Suman Chowdhury, Chief Economist and Head – Research, Acuité Ratings & Research.

In 2024, there's a buzz surrounding the potential breakthrough of pineapple pizza in Italy, courtesy of Gino Sorbillo, the acclaimed Naples pizzaiolo. He has boldly introduced the controversial ""ananas"" topping to his menu on Via dei Tribunali, the renowned pizza street in the pizza capital of the world, as per a CNN report.

Sorbillo's innovative creation, known as ""Margherita con Ananas"", comes with a price tag of 7 euros ($7.70). It's a pizza bianca, sans the traditional tomato layer.

Pineapple pizza boasts three varieties of cheese, and the pineapple undergoes a double cooking process, resulting in a delightful caramelized texture. Get ready for a unique pizza experience at the heart of Naples' pizza scene.

Gino Sorbillo takes a unique approach to his pineapple pizza creation. To start, he prebakes the pineapple in the oven and allows it to cool. Then, in a culinary twist, he adds smoked provola, a local cow milk cheese from Campania, along with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkling of fresh basil. The final touch involves placing the pizza in his wood-fired oven, infusing it with a distinct flavor profile.

However, the introduction of this unconventional pizza has sparked controversy among Italians, as the idea of pineapple on pizza is generally frowned upon. Since Sorbillo unveiled his creation on social media, it has triggered a wave of criticism, leading to what he describes as an 'uproar' with insults flying on social platforms and even discussions on national TV.

Despite the backlash, Sorbillo notes that those who dared to venture into trying this unique combination have expressed favorable opinions, challenging the traditional disdain for pineapple on pizza.

The largest shareholder of Religare Enterprises Limited (REL) has said that the matter requires investigation in terms of compliance with SEBI Takeover Regulations.

On Wednesday, ET had reported that a day after the Burman family announced an open offer to buy more shares to take control of the financial services conglomerate, Rashmi Saluja, executive chairperson of the company, acquired around 8% stake in its wholly-owned shadow bank Religare Finvest Limited (RFL), through an Employees Stock Option Plan (Esop) award.

""It is unfortunate that a solitary executive has cornered significant quantum of remuneration through ESOPs at Religare Enterprises Limited (REL), Care Health Insurance Limited, and RFL, all without approval and requisite disclosure to REL shareholders,"" the spokesperson said.

The Burman family also said that this raises question mark on the management and the independence of
the independent directors and their complicity in such unjustified dole outs.

""REL board should answer the shareholders whether there exist more instances of ESOP issuances to entities, and potential conflicts of interest,"" they added.

Further, the Burman family's spokesperson also remarked that these actions have eroded trust and confidence in the REL board, necessitating urgent need to restore credibility.

Rebutting this, REL, however, said that its Chairman Rashmi Saluja has not been issued any additional stock options of Religare Finvest.

The company in a statement said the approval sought at the AGM of RFL (Religare Finvest Ltd) held on September 26, 2023 was to seek enabling approval of shareholders for the proposed grant of ESOPs of RFL to Rashmi Saluja under the RFL ESOP Plan 2019.

The award in the unlisted subsidiary ascribed its value in a band of Rs 150-260 crore. Previously, proxy advisory firm InGovern had estimated the Esops awarded to Saluja in Religare Enterprises as well as its health insurance subsidiary Care Health Insurance to be worth Rs480 crore.

Together with the thus far undeclared award of stock options in Religare Finvest, the total compensation earned by Saluja via Esops could be between Rs630 and Rs740 crore. This is in addition to the annual salary and salary and places Saluja among the highest paid executives in Indian corporate history.

This stock award has become the latest flashpoint in the protracted battle of attrition that has broken out between the Burmans and the Religare board, led by Saluja, which has seen both sides approaching regulators against the other. Burmans, the billionaire promoters of FMCG major Dabur, are trying to gain control of Religare. The incumbent board, led by Saluja, is resisting.

While the board has written to regulators, as ET first reported on 9 November, arguing the Burmans were unfit to take over a conglomerate that possesses licenses to operate in regulated sectors such as housing finance, stock broking, health insurance and shadow banking, Burmans have accused Saluja of insider trading and abusing her position to gain excessive remuneration.

Burmans have denied the accusations and Saluja has denied insider trading and abusing her position to gain excessive remuneration. Burmans have denied the accusations and Saluja has denied insider trading allegations and said the remuneration was cleared by the board and all shareholders.

“The original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) shall maintain a year-wise record of such goods or articles and furnish the same, if so desired by the government,” the DPIIT said.

Exemptions have also been given to 6,000 hermetic compressors and heat exchangers domestically manufactured or imported for maintenance and sales every year by each of the manufacturers. Temperature sensing controls were also dropped from the list.

“This is subject to the condition that such manufacturers shall declare its old stock of hermetic compressors and heat exchangers,” it said.

According to the Wall Street Journal, defections across premium streamers rose 6.3% in November from 5.1% a year earlier. It also suggests that in the past two years, roughly 25% of those who subscribed to AppleTV+, Amazon’s PrimeVideo, Max, Peacock, Paramount+, Netflix, Hulu and Disney+ have canceled at least three of those options. It is an increase from 15% before hikes pushed the combined tab of the ad-free monthly costs for those eight streamers to $112.42 a month.

Streamers increase prices
Crystal Revis, a Lynn Haven, Fla., mother of six said to the New York Post that with the streaming services increasing their rates like they are, it’s like: ‘OK, do I pay for the cable?’

On the other hand, streamers increased their prices after they had come under pressure to improve profitability to offset the high costs of creating and licensing content.

These service providers have tried many options and a range of tactics to keep customers. They launched lower-cost ad-supported tiers, teamed up with rivals on bundled deals and provided discounts or free months of service, but the result was not satisfactory.

Customers return to appealing content
Analytics firm Antenna revealed that many customers who canceled service return to the streamers when there’s more appealing content available. Jonathan Carson, Co-founder and Chief Executive of Antenna said, ""Retention doesn’t just mean holding on to a new subscriber the first time they get them. It’s about managing a relationship over a true customer lifetime.""

The WSJ reported that among the US customers who joined Disney+ for the first time in November or converted from a trial, nearly 60% opted for the ad-supported tier. At Netflix, more than one-third of new US customers in November opted for the ad tier, compared to 11% a year earlier when the ad tier was introduced.

In a statement, it has stated that their demand for general amnesty to their cadres was not met.

In a letter to Centre’s interlocutor AK Mishra, outfit’s self-styled chairman and commander-in-chief Boby Marwein said, “We deeply regret to inform you that we are reluctantly withdrawing ourselves from the peace talks with your government. This decision has been made due to the unfortunate circumstance that our general demands have not been met.”

Marwein added, “It is with a heavy heart that we witness the peace process reaching such a critical point.”

The outfit recently issued a death threat to Gavin Mylliemngap, an MLA of the ruling National People’s Party in Meghalaya.

In a statement, outfit general secretary Sainkupar Nongtraw said, “If the government proceeds with the shutdown of MCCL, it would be appropriate for MLA Sohra Gavin to assume responsibility. Just as you and your government dare to bury MCCL alive, we will hold you accountable by our own actions. Traitors of the people should be punished with death.”

The tripartite peace talks began last year. The outfit demanded the withdrawal of all cases against its cadres before talks could proceed further.

Earlier NIA had filed a chargesheet against four members of the outlawed organisation for allegedly triggering a bomb on the premises of Star Cement Factory in East Jaintia Hills district in December 2020 for their failure to pay ransom.

In August 2021 violent protests broke out in different places in Meghalaya after General Secretary Chesterfield Thangkhiew of HNLC was killed in a police operation Chesterfield was a former militant and police have alleged his involvement in the IED explosion in Shillong. Two people were injured in that explosion.

The recent controversy unfolded after West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC leader Mamata Banerjee had in November advocated the need to give due respect to senior members and rejected the notion that elderly leaders should retire from active politics.

Following this, TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, Mamata Banerjee's nephew, proposed a retirement age in politics, citing declining work efficiency and productivity with advancing age. The party has since become a battleground for allegations and counter-allegations between senior and young leaders.

The tensions reached a new low when five-time TMC MLA Tapas Ray criticised veteran leader and TMC's Lok Sabha party leader Sudip Bandopadhyay, accusing him of compromising the party's interests for personal political gains.

Ray emphasised, ""We are loyal soldiers of the TMC. We have given our entire life for the party. We are neither tainted nor have been in prison on corruption charges.""

Referring to Bandopadhyay's past arrest in the Rose Valley scam in January 2017, Ray questioned his contributions to the party and accused him of insulting old and tested party workers.

Ray said, ""What has he done for the party apart from insulting old and tested party workers? He is now trying to create a division within the party. The kind of insult he has hurled at me for the last 15 years is unacceptable. I want justice.""

In response, senior TMC minister Firhad Hakim urged everyone to refrain from making such remarks in public domain and instead address issues through internal discussions within the party.

""Everyone should stop making such remarks in the public domain and sort out issues through discussions within the party,"" he said.

During a closed-door organisational meeting with the Bankura district unit, TMC leader Subrata Bakshi encouraged party workers to set aside grievances and work unitedly for the party.

The debate gained momentum on the party's foundation day on Monday when TMC state president Subrata Bakshi, known for his loyalty to Mamata Banerjee, expressed hope that Abhishek Banerjee would contest the upcoming Lok Sabha election with Mamata Banerjee's photo and not shy away from the field.

He said, ""Abhishek Banerjee is our national general secretary. Naturally, if Abhishek fights this election, we are sure that he will not back down from the fray. If he fights, he will fight with the photo of Mamata Banerjee and the party symbol.""

Bakshi's statement drew objections from the party's state general secretary Kunal Ghosh who called for a retraction.

Ghosh emphasised, ""I respect the state president, but I have objections to his phrasing of words. It is never desired. Abhishek is still in the fray. If the party listens to what he (Abhishek) wants to say, it is good for the party.""

In November, Ghosh, who is also the party spokesperson, addressed rumours of a power struggle, asserting that there is no conflict between the old and new factions, emphasising the necessity of both Mamata Banerjee and Abhishek Banerjee for the party.

This ongoing controversy recalls a two-year-old internal struggle within the TMC between the old guard and the younger faction.

Amidst rumours of an alleged power struggle in January 2022, TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee dissolved all national office-bearer committees, including the post of national general secretary held by her nephew Abhishek Banerjee.

Subsequently, a new committee was formed, and Abhishek was reinstated as the party's national general secretary.

Since then, Abhishek has not only gained prominence within the party but is also considered the de facto number two in the state's ruling dispensation.

This is Gurugram-based MobiKwik's second attempt towards an initial public offering (IPO) after it abandoned its listing plans on account of weak market conditions.

The fresh issue will also include a pre-IPO placement, as per the company filings with the Registrar of Companies (RoC).

The Peak XV-backed fintech firm had first filed its draft red herring prospectus in July 2021 and had received the approval of market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for its Rs 1,900 crore ($255 million) IPO, later in October 2021.

Interestingly, the current public share sale is less than half of what MobiKwik previously intended to raise through listing in the domestic bourses.

Bloomberg had earlier reported that the company was working with DAM Capital Advisors and SBI Capital Markets to prepare for its listing, with the share sale expected to happen in 2024.

Last year, MobiKwik said that it posted its second consecutive quarterly profit for the quarter ending September 30.

For the September quarter, Mobikwik recorded a revenue of Rs 208 crore, up 17% from the previous three months, while total profit stood at Rs 5 crore.

On a half-yearly basis, total revenue for the startup stood at Rs 385 crore while total profit was Rs 8 crore for the fiscal year 2024.

Credit operations contributed to almost 60% of the company’s topline, with the rest coming from digital payments, company cofounder and chief executive Bipin Preet Singh told ET then.

It offers users credit under the Zip franchise and provides personal loans as well as a pay-later option to salaried professionals.

Mobikwik claims to have a base of 140 million users, with a quarter of them (roughly 35 million) being active."

""The quantity of 8,606 MTRV raw cane sugar to be exported to USA under TRQ scheme from 01.10.2023 to 30.09.2024 has been notified,"" the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) said in a public notice.

India, the world's second-biggest producer and the largest consumer of sugar, has a preferential quota arrangement for sugar export with the European Union as well. The DGFT said that the quota will be operated by Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA).

In July 2023, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) had announced the country-specific (including from India) and first-come, first-served in-quota allocations of the TRQs on imported raw cane sugar, refined and specialty sugar, and sugar-containing products for Fiscal Year 2024 (October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024).

TRQs allow countries to export specified quantities of a product to the United States at a relatively low tariff, but subject all imports of the product above a pre-determined threshold to a higher tariff.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/c-suite/companies-tightening-contracts-to-make-exit-tough-for-senior-executives/articleshow/106521542.cms,"Indian companies are aggressively tightening employment contracts for top executives — to make them more binding — by incorporating stricter non-compete and non-solicitation clauses, at a time when there is a cut-throat competition for senior talent and rampant poaching of C-suite brass.

While non-competes cannot be enforced against an employee post-employment, contracts and policies are being made tighter to make an exit difficult, said top lawyers and company officials.

These include longer notice periods and extended non-poaching contracts. Also, ‘liquidated damages’ provisions are being built in more frequently where a predetermined amount has to be paid by the outgoing executive as damages for failure to perform under a contract.

IT major Wipro recently sought Rs 25 crore damages from former chief financial officer Jatin Dalal for breach of non-compete rule in his employment contract. Infosys reportedly sent written communication to Cognizant after several of its senior executives left to join the rival firm.

“An organisation cannot hold a person back, but the idea is to make an exit more inconvenient,” said Atul Gupta, partner at law firm Trilegal. “Lot of companies are looking at extending the cooling off period in senior management contracts,” he added.

Sumit Mitra, head of human resources at Godrej Consumer Products, said: “Contracts with non-compete clauses legally hold little water, while everyone takes care to protect company confidentiality.”

Many employment contracts for CXOs and key personnel now include notice periods of six months to 12 months versus 30 days to 90 days earlier. Duration for non-solicitation — to prevent the outgoing top officials from poaching teams or clients — could be as long as 12 months to two years.

“While the restrictive covenant tenure for key executives usually ranged from six months to one year, organisations have considered additional tenure for specific key employees who occupy positions of financial and strategic responsibility,” said Anshul Prakash, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.

Usually, senior exits are discussed within and when that happens, dialogues and discussions between the executive and the company iron out a lot of issues, said Mitra of Godrej Consumer Products.

However, in his view, legally challenging or threatening an employee never helps because one doesn’t really want an unwilling employee in an organisation. “We should also do our basics and be sure that proper documentation is done in a waterproof way so that business interest is protected and we use the legal route when absolutely needed,"" he added.

Companies are becoming more aggressive as they have faced challenging situations due to abrupt exit of key personnel that can be severely debilitating to an organisation and also lead to confidential business plans and information.

The primary objective is also to send out a strict message to the existing employees that any such behaviour will not be tolerated.

“That is largely the principal objective of the establishment's actions against executive's breach as well as of the contractual stipulations. Organisations would not want any compromise on their stance against breach of employment obligations at all levels and especially at the senior or senior most level across functions so that employees are mindful of potential implications that a breach on their part may entail,” said Prakash.

“The specificity of mentioning what constitutes ‘competing’ companies is now followed to the fault with the list being made exhaustive to include tier-2 companies as well besides direct competition,” said R Suresh, CEO, Insist Consulting.

Lawyers said it is becoming an increasingly common practice for companies - not just in IT but other sectors such as pharma, financial services and manufacturing – to send out legal notices to new employers intimating them when any senior employee has not adhered to a contract. Earlier, such moves would have often been ignored.

A senior counsel at a leading Mumbai-based conglomerate said that usually boards avoid legally challenging or threatening executives as it also hurts the reputation of the company doing so. ""So legal threats are hardly ever used and unless there has been some serious charge of breaking or some major evidence of breaking some confidentiality aspect of services or products, boards discourage legal actions,"" he said."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/xiaomi-lists-premiumisation-aiot-omnichannel-push-as-india-priorities/articleshow/106523015.cms,"Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi is kicking off 2024 with a three-year strategy to become India’s most preferred smartphone plus AIoT (artificial intelligence of things) brand, having regained some of the lost foothold in 2023, a top executive said on Wednesday.

“With the reset, recharge, refresh strategy and Xiaomi getting its mojo back (in 2023), we now have a three-year gameplan to play with, wherein we want to be the aspirational Indian’s most preferred and pioneering smartphone x AIoT brand,” Xiaomi India president Muralikrishnan B told reporters.

Premiumisation, fostering an integrated smartphone x AIoT experience for users, and synergising the omnichannel sales strategy will be the key pillars of the plan, he said.

“In 2024, the smartphone market in India will grow in a single-digit percentage, largely driven by 5G, and we’d like to be at the forefront of it,” Muralikrishnan said. “Over three years, definitely we would want to have a substantial share of the premium segment.”

The positive outlook on spending by the middle class in the coming years will also boost the smartphone market going forward, he added.

At the same time, the company will be open to leveraging its R&D investments in generative AI “as and when chipsets develop new capabilities”, though it will be up to application makers to get the best out of it, Muralikrishnan said.

Chinese smartphone makers, bogged down by government scrutiny and competition in the market from major rivals such as Samsung, Vivo, Oppo and Apple, are looking to regain their once-dominant market shares in India. The company, which was the smartphone market leader for several years, had lost the crown to Samsung at the start of 2023 and then further slid to the fourth spot, before clawing back to the number two position recently.

As part of the revival plan, Xiaomi, for instance, has since last year been looking to expand its offline retail presence and move away from its heavy reliance on online channels where its shipments declined in 2023.

The Indian smartphone market has seen a slump for two years, with experts and market trackers now forecasting an improvement in 2024. IDC India forecast 5-8% on-year growth in 2024 with shipments expected to hit 148 million units, while Counterpoint Research pegged it at 5% with shipments to be in the 155-157 million range.

The growth is expected to be on the back of 5G devices and smartphones likely to be given away by political parties ahead of the general elections.

Muralikrishnan said there are opportunities for 5G offerings at every price segment. “Our aspiration would be to play across price points while staying true to having a winner product in all key price categories and not overly cluttering the portfolio.”

After facing challenges in 2022, the company saw 2023 as a year for recovery, he said. It took a bet on 5G devices and cut back the number of models in its portfolio by 40% last year. The company aims to stick to a similar strategy going forward, the executive said.

In our early look at the removals scheduled throughout February 2024, we've got the scoop on titles you won't want to miss before they vanish from your streaming list.

Ancelotti faces defensive challenges as David Alaba joins Eder Militao on the long-term injury list, and club captain Nacho Fernandez serves a suspension.

Real Madrid are in red hot form this season with just one defeat across all competitions as Ancelotti aims for a potential trophy quadruple in 2024.

Mallorca have stablised following a difficult start to the campaign, and they will be confident of avoiding a relegation battle, but the hosts should have too much attacking power in this clash.

Real Madrid have won their last seven successive home league ties against Mallorca and Ancelotti will want to start 2024 with a victory.

Prediction: Real Madrid 2-0 Mallorca

By contrast, Reliance Jio added 1.84 million active users in October 2023, indicating strong adoption of its affordable internet-enabled feature phone, . Loss-making (Vi) once again lost around 1.41 million active users after reporting a surprise 0.4 million such additions in September 2023 after many months.

Active, or visitor location register (VLR), data put out every month by Trai, indicates the number of mobile users regularly using a mobile network.

Airtel’s active user base dropped to 374.96 million in October 2023 — from 376.15 million in September 2023. Jio’s active user base rose to 422.11 million in October. Vi’s active user base, in turn, shrank to 198.38 million, as per Trai data.

At press time, Airtel did not respond to ET’s query on the reason for the sharp drop in its active user base. Back in August 2023 too, the Sunil Mittal-led telco’s active user base dipped by around 0.4 million.

Visitor location register, a key metric reflecting the number of active users on a mobile network, indicated that Airtel had 99.31% of its users active on the network, 93.31% for Jio and 87.98% for Vi.

On the gross customer additions score, Jio’s gains were sharply higher than Airtel’s in October 2023. Latest data collated by the regulator showed that Jio added 3.15 million mobile users in October while Airtel reported a modest 0.35 million additions, continuing to be weighed down by the hefty hikes taken in its base prepaid rates.

Vi continued to suffer heavy losses, resulting in its gross mobile user base shrinking by 2.04 million to 225.48 million in end-October.

Trai data showed Jio’s gross mobile user base surged to 452.36 million in October while Airtel’s rose modestly to 378.13 million.

Trai data showed Jio widened its customer market share to 39.3% (39.06%) while Airtel’s was unchanged at 32.85% over the previous month. Vi’s narrowed to 19.59 % (19.78%).

The combination of Vi’s heavy customer losses and Airtel’s modest gains resulted in India’s mobile user base rising by a paltry 0.03% to 1.150 billion in end-October.

Overall wireless tele-density was unchanged at 82.54% in October as in September 2023.

Jio also consolidated its market leadership in the landline segment last October. The telco added 0.21 million wireline users, boosting its landline user base to 10.67 million. Second-ranked Airtel added 0.14 million users, boosting its wireline user base to about 8.07 million. Third-ranked state-owned BSNL conceded more ground, losing another 40,926 wireline users, reducing its landline user base further to 6.2 million, as per current Trai data.

Analysts said Vi’s continuing customer losses underlined its continuing liquidity woes amid a long-pending fundraising that has hindered its 4G network expansion and delayed its 5G rollout, factors that have further hurt its ability to retain customers."

""In Delhi, Union Minister Shantanu Thakur says one thing and his version changes when he is in Bengal. This is regarding CAA. Our Chief M and the chairperson AITC have categorically mentioned that CAA will not be implemented in Bengal. Those who are already citizens of Bengal need not be given citizenship twice. They are recipients and beneficiaries of various developmental schemes in Bengal. BJP is merely using CAA as a tool before elections and it is quite evident from what Shantanu Thakur is saying in his speech."" State Minister Sashi Panja said.

In a recent programme, Union Minister of Shipping (MoS) Shantanu Thakur has faced protest after mentioning CAA issue in a religious programme.

Thakur said before last Lok Sabha polls he has said that CAA will be passed but never mentioned that it will be implemented. “I have never said that CAA will have to be implemented before 2024 Lok Sabha polls. What we said before 2019 lok Sabha polls is that “Give vote to us and we will pass CAA in Parliament. I always remember what I say.”

“Thakur has said he never promised that CAA will be implemented before the 2024 Lok Sabha election. They are going back on their words and they are double speak,” Panja attacked.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have visited Matua stronghold in Bongaon and Matua Thakurbari and have fielded Shantanu Thakur with CAA card. Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on November 29, while addressing a mega rally in Kolkata, that the Central government will implement the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) which is the law of the country now and no one can stop it.

""Nitish Kumar is such a senior leader. If such a proposal comes, it will be great for Bihar,"" Yadav told reporters at the Gaya airport when his comments were sought on the speculations that the JD(U) president could be made the convenor of the opposition coalition.

The young RJD leader, whose party is the largest constituent of the ruling Mahagathbandhan in Bihar, recalled that the alliance, which was in opposition until August 2022, decided to align with the JD(U) with the objective of defeating the BJP.

""We came together in Bihar after which efforts were made to bring together parties opposed to the BJP across the country, which culminated in the formation of the INDIA bloc. Hence, there is no reason to worry about seat-sharing. It will be sorted out in good time,"" he asserted.

Meanwhile, in Patna, state Congress president Akhilesh Prasad Singh told a press conference that his party acknowledged Nitish Kumar's stature and would not flinch from backing him if other constituents of INDIA agreed to make him the convenor.

""Nobody has any doubts about the calibre, stature, personality and political acumen of Nitish Kumar. Also, there cannot be any two views about the crucial role he played in bringing together anti-BJP parties across the country,"" said Singh, a Rajya Sabha member.

""The decision of making him a convenor would require a consensus. If other constituents of the INDIA bloc give their consent, rest assured that the Congress will not hesitate in throwing its weight behind such a proposal,"" he added.

Asked about Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge's name having been proposed for PM candidate by AAP and TMC at the last INDIA coalition meet a fortnight ago, Singh pointed out, ""He has himself made it very clear that this was not the time to think of who will assume power. Our priority is to ensure that the BJP is defeated.""

Asked about reports in a section of the press that the Congress, which is a junior partner in Bihar's ruling Mahagathbandhan, has demanded nine out of the state's 40 Lok Sabha seats, he said that decisions on the seat-sharing are taken by the top leadership of the party.

""Announcements will be made from the appropriate level once a decision is arrived at,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the BJP, which has been sore over having lost power in Bihar as a result of Nitish Kumar's exit from the NDA, claimed RJD president Lalu Prasad was ""conspiring"" to make Tejashwi, his son and heir apparent, the chief minister of the state.

""With the Congress, he is trying to make Nitish Kumar vacate his chair to become convenor of INDIA,"" BJP's OBC Morcha national general secretary Nikhil Anand alleged in a statement.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/new-updates/hyderabad-man-turns-to-horseback-to-deliver-food-amid-fuel-shortage-and-strike/articleshow/106522870.cms,"Hyderabad: In a bizarre turn of events in Hyderabad, a video has taken social media by storm, featuring a delivery person transporting food on horseback. The viral video captures the horse rider explaining to a passerby that, even after waiting in line for three hours at a gas station, he couldn't get petrol.

This incident unfolded amidst long queues at petrol pumps in various parts of Hyderabad, triggered by concerns over fuel shortages during a truck driver protest.

— ArbaazTheGreat1 (@ArbaazTheGreat1)

The protest by truck drivers is against a provision in the new penal law on hit-and-run accident cases involving motorists.

The footage, widely shared on social media, prompted one netizen to humorously comment, ""Delivery Agent Drops Order In #Hyderabad On A Horse. Reason: Fuel Shortage"".

The online food delivery platform associated with the incident has yet to make a public statement, leaving the details of the horse-riding delivery person and the context of the video shrouded in mystery.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/2020-delhi-riots-court-convicts-man-of-rioting-arson-and-robbery-offences/articleshow/106523147.cms,"A court here Wednesday convicted a person of various offences in connection with the 2020 northeast Delhi riots, including arson, robbery and rioting, saying the charges were proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also held another accused guilty of dishonesty and receiving stolen property.

Additional Sessions Judge Pulastya Pramachala was hearing a case against Noor Mohammad alias Noora and Nabi Mohammad.

Noor was accused of being a part of a riotous mob that torched an automobile shop and some vehicles, looted shops and robbed two shopowners of their mobile phones during the riots in Karawal Nagar on February 24, 2020.

According to the prosecution, Nabi had purchased the looted mobile phone from Noor despite being aware it was stolen.

The court rejected the argument of the defence counsel challenging the credibility of Noor's identification by a key witness, saying his testimony was ""improvised"".

Noting that the witness, Shiv Kumar Raghav, was the president of the area's market association and that he had identified Noor as the culprit who snatched his mobile phone, the court said just because he did not mention some ""minor details"" before the police, his statement could not be called as improvised.

The court said, ""The defence has not projected any motive for prosecution witness (PW) 3 (Raghav) to falsely implicate accused Noora in this case except for the suggestion that he did so on the tutoring of the investigating officer (IO). Mere a bald suggestion cannot be given much attention"".

It said the recovery of Raghav's mobile phone, based on Noora's information that it was sold to Nabi, also confirmed the accused's identification as the robber.

""The testimony of PW3 therefore establishes that accused Noora was part of the rioters, which attacked the property (market association's office),"" the court said.

""This goes on to prove that accused Noora was not only personally involved in robbing the mobile phone and cash amount from PW3 and prosecution witness (PW) 2 (Dalip, owner of a vehicle service centre) respectively, but he was also involved along with other rioters in vandalising and setting ablaze the shop of PW2 and the motorcycles lying therein,"" it added.

The court further said that the same mob had vandalised and torched another furniture shop in the area.

Regarding Nabi, the court said he had failed to offer and establish a justification for possessing the mobile phone. ""Therefore, accused Nabi Mohammad is presumed to be in possession of this robbed mobile phone with the requisite culpable knowledge,"" the court said.

""I find that charges levelled against both the accused persons in this case are proved beyond a reasonable doubt,"" the court added.

The Khajuri Khas police station had filed a chargesheet against Noor for the penal provisions of arson, causing mischief by fire, robbery and rioting, while Nabi was accused of dishonestly receiving stolen property.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ahead-of-market-10-things-that-will-decide-d-street-action-on-thursday/articleshow/106522818.cms,"Indian benchmark equity indices declined on Wednesday, dragged down by information technology and metal stocks, as global markets slid amid fading optimism about early US interest rate cuts ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve minutes.

The NSE Nifty 50 index fell 0.69% to 21,517, while the S&P BSE Sensex shed 0.75% to 71,356.

Here's how analysts read the market pulse:
""Nifty formed a bearish candle with a substantial body in the daily chart. The Donchian Channels, which identify bullish and bearish extremes, indicate that Nifty is holding its middle band. Key support levels are identified at 21,400, while resistance is placed at 21,700 levels,"" said Om Mehra, Technical Analyst, SAMCO Securities.

Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said, ""Nifty dipped below the support level of 21,650, resulting in a decline towards 21,500. The prevailing sentiment appears weak, highlighted by the index closing below the crucial support at 21,650. If it continues to drop below 21,500 in the upcoming days, it could potentially exacerbate the negative sentiment, especially with expectations of substantial unwinding by the put writers below 21,500. The broader suggests a sell-on-rise strategy as long as it stays below 21,650.""

That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Thursday's action:


stocks slumped to start Wednesday with all three major US indices in the red and key names such as Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Nvidia falling.

Around 10 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.4 percent to 37,571.60, while the broad-based S&P 500 Index lost 0.5 percent to 4,718.88. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index retreated 0.6 percent to 14,670.94.


Europe's benchmark stock index dropped to a three-week low on Wednesday, testing last year's market rally, with investors keeping an eye out for major factors during the day for cues on global monetary policy.

The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.8% by 1310 GMT, losing as much as 1% intraday, after kicking off the New Year on a lacklustre note on Tuesday.


Nifty on Wednesday ended 148 points lower to form a long negative candle on the daily chart placed at the edge of breaking below the immediate support of 10-day EMA.

The positive chart pattern like higher tops and bottoms is intact on the daily chart and the present weakness could be in line with the formation of new higher bottoms of the sequence. A decisive move below 21,500 levels could open the next downside of 21,255 (20-day EMA) and the 20,980 levels in the near term. Immediate resistance is placed at 2,1670, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities.


Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence () showed bullish trade on the counters of Alok Industries, Vaibhav Global, HPCL, Alembic Pharma, Symphony, and Suven Pharma among others.

The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.


The MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of HLE Glasscoat, Chola Investment & Finance, Sundram Fasteners, Quess Corp, Bayer Cropscience, and IDFC among others. A bearish crossover on the MACD on these counters indicated that they had just begun their downward journey.


Adani Enterprises (Rs 6,037 crore), Adani Ports (Rs 3,659 crore), HDFC Bank (Rs 2,386 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 1,652 crore), RIL (Rs 1,177 crore), ITC (Rs 1,147 crore), and Infosys (Rs 1,132 crore) among others were among the most active stocks on NSE in value terms. Higher activity on a counter in value terms can help identify the counters with the highest trading turnovers in the day.


Tata Steel (Shares traded: 4.5 crore), Adani Ports (Shares traded: 3.3 crore), ITC (Shares traded: 2.4 crore), Adani Enterprises (Shares traded: 1.9 crore), ICICI Bank (Shares traded: 1.6 crore), SBI (Shares traded: 1.4 crore), and NTPC (Shares traded: 1.4 crore) among others were among the most traded stocks in the session on NSE.


Shares of Bajaj Auto, Adani Ports, Cipla, Apollo Hospital, Sun Pharma, and Divis Labs, among others, witnessed strong buying interest from market participants as they scaled their fresh 52-week highs, signaling bullish sentiment.


No major stocks hit its 52-week low on Wednesday.


Overall, market breadth favoured bulls as 2,137 stocks ended in the green, while 1,706 names settled in the red.

But among sector majors, Infosys is seen underperforming Tata Consultancy Services significantly in terms of earnings growth in the quarter gone by.

While TCS is seen reporting a moderate growth in revenue in constant currency terms sequentially, Infosys will see the topline declining by more than 1%, according to estimates given by brokerage firms.

Deeper furloughs in the quarter and overall slowdown in the business is likely to result in a 1.4-1.7% sequential drop in constant currency revenue for Infosys in the December quarter.

“We expect Infosys' 3Q revenues to decline by 1.4 QoQcc due to reversal of one-offs of Q2, revenue leakage and deeper furloughs in a seasonally weak quarter,” Jefferies said in its report.

Furloughs is a period when employees go on leave, and this typically occurs during the December quarter, particularly in the western countries.

On the contrary, TCS is expected to report 0.4-1.5% sequential growth in constant currency revenue in the same period, driven by large deal ramp ups even though furloughs impacted to some extent.

On the profitability front too, TCS is expected to do much better than Infosys, as the latter will see an impact of wage hikes.

Analysts expect TCS’ margins to be flat to up 45 basis points sequentially from 24.3% on the back of better operational efficiencies. On the other hand, Infosys is likely to see margin drop by 73-121 basis points from 21.2%.

“EBIT margins are likely to contract 70 bps - two months wage hike impact + furloughs + revenue decline,” Nuvama Institutional Equities said in its report.

Weighed down by a fall in revenue and contraction in margin, Infosys will see the net profit decline 1-2% sequentially, whereas TCS will see a growth of around 2%.

While Q3 will turn out to be a flop show for Infosys, the company’s guidance for FY24 and beyond will be crucial for Dalal Street.

Analysts don’t expect the company to tweak its growth guidance for the current financial year.

In terms of stock performance, both TCS and Infosys shares have moved largely in tandem during the last quarter, giving more than 7% returns."

In an order, Civil Judge (Senior Division) Kamla Kant Gupta directed the AAP MP to pay the damages within two months, failing which an interest of six per cent will be imposed on the amount.

The court had issued notice to Sanjay Singh, currently in jail in connection with the Delhi excise policy scam case, but he did not respond to it. Hence the court proceeded ex parte against him.

Addressing a press conference in Lucknow on August 8, 2021, the AAP leader had accused Mahendra Kumar Singh, the then Jal Shakti minister of Uttar Pradesh, of indulging in corruption in the implementation of the Jal Jeevan Mission.

Mahendra Kumar Singh subsequently filed a civil defamation suit against the AAP MP and sought Rs 21 lakh in damages.

The court also directed the AAP leader to remove videos and print materials on his remarks from social media platforms.

Pronouncing the ex-parte verdict, the judge held that Sanjay Singh had made a defamatory statement against Mahendra Kumar Singh without any evidence and basis.

""The Indian Constitution ensures freedom of speech to every citizen, but it also imposes reasonable restriction on the use of this right,"" the court observed.

Holding that Sanjay Singh has to remove the defamatory contents from social media platforms, the court observed, ""As far as compensation is concerned, it is difficult to value the respect of a person and loss caused to him by a defamatory statement. But having regard to the status of the parties, their area of work and in the facts of the case, Rs 1 lakh compensation would be just and reasonable.""

Sadvi Niranjan Jyoti, Union minister of state (MoS) rural development, who was in Kolkata on Wednesday to attend some political programmes, said, ""People of West Bengal are also our own. Their rights cannot be snatched or taken away by any individual or “parivaarbaadi” (who pursues dynastic politics) people. We will not allow that to happen.”

""There are certain pockets in the state where Rs 4 crore corruption, including Darjeeling, took place. Our aim was not to stop the funds... but the corruption should be probed,” the Union minister who visited the Kalighat Temple said. ""When West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, two nodal officers from the Centre and Bengal were appointed. Please conduct a probe (to the Bengal government) on corruption and solve the problems...We have no intention of stopping funds. If we had such an intention, we would have stopped funds of PM Awas Yojana, Sadak Yojana and other schemes but we did not do it, Sadvi Jyoti said.

Last year in October, Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee along with party MPs had staged a dharna in New Delhi on the pending dues for MGNREGA and various central schemes. The Trinamool MP had also taken some beneficiaries, who had not received their dues for more than two years, to the national capital. The Trinamool Congress leadership, including Abhishek Banerjee, had claimed that Union minister Jyoti had fled her office from the backdoor, keeping them waiting for several hours.

Talking about that incident, Jyoti said, ""I waited for them for more than two hours. They did not intend to hold a meeting with me but wanted to stage a dharna. They did not even bring any data with them.”

On December 20, Mamata Banerjee, along with nine party MPs, met PM Modi and submitted a memorandum urging him to release the pending dues to the state. Banerjee had said the PM proposed that a meeting be arranged between the officials of the Centre and the state government to sort out pending issues related to the release of central funds.

The Uddhav Thackeray-led party is an ally of Congress in Maha Vikas Aghadi and also a member of the INDIA bloc of opposition parties.

In an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana, the Shiv Sena (UBT) took a dig at the BJP, saying the Babri mosque wouldn't have been brought down if the prime minister at that time was from that party.

P V Narasimha Rao was the prime minister when the structure was razed in December 1992.

""If Congress has received any special invitation for the Ram temple consecration ceremony then it (the leaders) should go to Ayodhya. What is wrong with it?"" the editorial asked.

Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and parliamentary party chairperson Sonia Gandhi have been invited to the consecration ceremony scheduled to be held on January 22.

The Congress on Friday said it would decide about Kharge and Sonia Gandhi attending the event at an ""appropriate time"". Congress' leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury has also been invited.

""The Congress' soul is Hindu. There is nothing to hide in it,"" the edit said.

It is wrong to say that the BJP is the beholder of Hindutva as claimed by that party. The Congress has equally contributed to the growth of Hindu culture, it added.

""The Congress never opposed the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya. Former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi was of the opinion that Ram temple should be constructed in Ayodhya. It was on the instructions of Rajiv Gandhi that the famous serial Ramayan was telecast on Doordarshan,"" the edit said.

In July last year, the financial services arm of Reliance Industries and the world’s largest asset management firm BlackRock, signed an agreement to form a 50:50 joint venture (JV) to offer investment solutions.

Jio Financial and BlackRock are targeting an initial investment of $150 million each in the JV, to be named Jio BlackRock.

Although it did not include any bloodshed or body count, the revolution led by Savitribai Phule is no less monumental than India’s struggle for Independence.

Along with her husband Jyotiba Phule, Savitribai is said to be the pioneer of the women’s rights movement in India. Besides championing women’s empowerment and education, she also contributed a lot to the emancipation of people from Dalit or untouchable castes.

Together with her husband, she established the first school for women in 1848.

On her 193rd birth anniversary, let’s revisit the life of India’s first feminist.

She was born on January 3, 1831, in a little hamlet called Naigaon which was located in the Satara District of Maharashtra.
She hailed from the Mali community. Considered as one of the marginalised communities in India, the Malis were traditionally engaged in gardening.
She got married at a very tender age. At the time of their wedding, Savitribai was 9 or 10, while her husband was 13.
She was illiterate at the time of her marriage. Her husband took charge of her education. She was also enrolled in two teacher’s training programs -the first was at an institution run by an American missionary, Cynthia Farrar, in Ahmednagar, and the second course was at a Normal School in Poona (Now Pune).
The couple was ostracised by their family for their attempts to challenge the status quo. In 1839, the pair got thrown out of their ancestral home by Jyotiba’s father as their work was considered wrong according to the Hindu text ‘Manusmriti’.
After her education, she started teaching girls in Poona. In 1848, she established the first girl’s school at Bhidewada, Pune. By the end of 1851, she launched three such schools, with about 150 female students enrolled.
Both she and her husband fierce opposition from the orthodox segments of the society. According to author Divya Kandukuri, Savitribai often carried an extra sari while travelling to her schools, as she was attacked with stones, dung, etc.
In the 1850s, the dynamic duo also started earnest attempts to empower the Dalit community. They launched two educational trusts - the Native Male School, Pune, and the Society for Promoting the Education of Mahar, Mangs that worked towards the upliftment of oppressed classes.
In 1863, Jyotirao and Savitribai established Balhatya Pratibandhak Griha, India's first home working towards prohibiting female infanticide and helping pregnant Brahmin widows and rape victims.

Punjab's Finance Minister Harpal Singh Cheema on Wednesday said the net GST collection up to December in FY24 was Rs 15,523.74 crore against the mop-up of Rs 13,322.59 crore during the April-December period of the previous financial year.

Thus, the net increase in GST collection amounts to Rs 2,201.15 crore, he added.

The minister said that the revenue from excise levy up to December in FY23 was Rs 6,050.7 crore, whereas for the current fiscal year, it rose to Rs 6,679.84 crore.

Giving details about state's tax revenue, Cheema, in an official statement, said that Punjab achieved a growth rate of 14.15 per cent in total revenue from VAT, CST, GST, PSDT and excise up to December during the current fiscal year as compared to the same period of FY23.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/joker-and-batman-are-brothers-heres-the-truth/articleshow/106522331.cms,"In Todd Phillips' 'Joker,' the narrative delves into the origins of the iconic villain, portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in the role of Arthur Fleck. While Fleck was initially shown as a mentally unstable individual, he eventually became Gotham City and Batman's most deadly adversary.

A prominent theme in the film revolves around the complex relationship between Arthur and Thomas Wayne, raising intriguing questions, such as the possibility of Bruce Wayne's brother being the Joker.

Throughout the course of Todd Phillips' Joker, the character Arthur, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is depicted as an unreliable narrator. This prompts speculation about the authenticity of his story and the film's conclusion.

Speculations surrounding the plot of 'Joker: Folie à Deux' suggest that the sequel will adopt the perspective of Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn. It is proposed that her portrayal will involve perceiving her connection with Arthur as a romantic musical, continuing the exploration of an unreliable narrator.

Arthur discovers a letter from his mother, Penny, in which she claims that he is the illegitimate son of Thomas Wayne. According to Penny, they had an illicit relationship during her employment with him. She also alleged that Thomas utilized his wealth and influence to manipulate paperwork, creating a false impression that Arthur had been adopted by her.

Upon encountering Alfred at the entrance of Wayne Manor, shortly after attempting to interact with Bruce, Arthur realizes that Alfred remembers his mother. In a subsequent confrontation with Thomas in a theater restroom, Thomas vehemently denies any involvement with Penny and insists that Arthur is adopted.

To seek clarity, Arthur investigates Arkham and locates Penny's file. The document not only indicates that his mother suffered from delusional psychosis and narcissistic personality disorder but also reveals her conviction for endangering the welfare of her child.

So, there is clear indication that 'Joker' Arthur Fleck and 'Batman' Bruce Wayne are not siblings or half-brothers. However, we may get more clarity in the upcoming film.

FAQs:
Q1. What is the name of Joker?
A1. Joker's name is Arthur Fleck.

Q2. What is the name of Batman?
A2. Batman's name is Bruce Wayne.

This is being done in collaboration with the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), an arm of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).

""Presently, the monitoring of plantations relies on site visits by field personnel,"" an official statement said while noting that the NRSC will undertake a comprehensive pan-India estimation of green cover for National Highways using high-resolution satellite imagery.

""It will also facilitate targeted interventions in regions that are reported to lack adequate green cover,"" the statement added.

This approach promises to provide a time-saving and cost-effective solution to generate a macro-level estimate of the degree of greenness along National Highways. Pilot projects for the same have already been successful.

The aim is to capture the Green Cover Index region-wise for National Highways in the first assessment cycle. Subsequent annual cycles will focus on estimating the growth patterns of green cover for National Highways using scientific techniques, the statement added.

Findings of the index will facilitate comparison and ranking of various National Highways for timely and periodic intervention. As green cover would be estimated for every 1 km length of the National Highways, it would be possible to generate granular metrics for individual projects as well.

For those, whose New Year resolution includes reducing alcohol addiction, now’s the time to curb your alcohol cravings.

Many individuals around the world have taken up the challenge of being alcohol-free in January. The month has come to be referred to as ‘Dry January’.

What Is The Dry January Challenge?
The challenge originated in the United Kingdom in 2013. The concept was created by Alcohol Change UK, as an attempt to help alcoholics steer clear of alcohol successfully.

Over the years, the challenge has gone global as there are myriad benefits of keeping alcohol at arm’s length.

Alcohol addiction causes many health issues such as more propensity for a heart attack, increased cholesterol and blood pressure, a spike in blood sugar level, infertility (due to diminished ovarian reserve), etc.

Want to curb your pangs to down a bottle but don’t know how? Here’s a guide:

Take Care Of Your Mental Health
Although not all alcohol addicts drink out of depression, a fair amount of people do.

If you fall into this category, then make sure to surround yourself with well-wishers such as family and close friends. Ensure your support system is rock solid. Consult a psychologist if need be.

Don’t try to internalise your frustrations or feelings as you may be tempted to drown the hurt away through alcohol.

Remember The Pain
Most of us would like to steer clear of all memories of when we were sick, but in this case, it would pay you well to remember how helpless you felt by drowning in alcohol and how it triggered your health issues. This may help you avoid the bars.

Sip On Alcohol-Free Drinks
Who said non-alcoholic party drinks can’t be delicious? When in the mood to sip on something, ask the bartender at the party to whip you a mocktail made from fresh fruit juice, or chocolate!

Look For Alternatives
Desperately looking for a liquid courage that won’t damage your health? Sip on a cup of coffee or tea. If you want a drink that mimics alcohol but comes without the bad effects - look no further than liquor tea!

If You Can’t Do Without Alcohol …
If you have to have at least a bit of alcohol in your diet, invest in a bottle of red wine or rose wine!"

He appeared to be glumly lost in his thoughts as he slumped over a cup of Joe. De Blasio was found gazing out onto Lafayette Street, holding his phone and sporting headphones.

Bill de Blasio's Lonely Image
The lonely image was in contrast to his last recorded public sighting in the Big Apple in December when he was caught looking dapper in a black sweater and purple suit while holding hands with Kristy Stark, a married businesswoman who runs her own literacy company.

De Blasio’s date
De Blasio’s outing with Stark was the latest apparent date he has been spotted on since the ex-mayor and his wife of 30 years, Chirlane McCray, announced separation in July last year. He was seen on a candlelight date with a mystery woman in Lower Manhattan, laughing and sipping wine for three hours at the upscale La Mercerie.

De Blasio spotted with brunette
De Blasio was spotted in August last year in Soho with a young brunette who worked in his administration.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/ed-opposes-interim-bail-plea-of-supertech-chairman-r-k-arora-in-money-laundering-case/articleshow/106522017.cms,"The Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday opposed in a Delhi court an application filed by the chairman and promoter of real estate major Supertech Group, R K Arora, seeking interim bail for three months on medical grounds in a money laundering case. Arora's application was moved before Additional Sessions Judge Devender Kumar Jangala on account of his ""deteriorating medical condition which has been aggravating ever since his incarceration as he was already suffering from various life-threatening diseases"".

Enforcement Directorate's Special Public Prosecutor N K Matta and advocate Mohd Faizan Khan told the court there was no need to release the accused on bail since all medical assistance he required was already available in the prison.

The judge is likely to take up the matter for further consideration on January 5.

The application, moved on December 22, claimed Arora required treatment at a private hospital.

""It is pertinent to state herein that the Applicant warrants urgent medical/surgical treatment of serious life-threatening diseases, ailments,"" the application said.

The court had on October 15 dismissed Arora's plea seeking default bail in the case.

Arora was arrested on June 27 under the criminal sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after three rounds of questioning.

The money laundering case against the Supertech group, its directors and promoters, stems from a clutch of FIRs registered by police in Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.

The ED has been probing 26 FIRs registered by the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh police against Supertech Ltd and its group companies for alleged criminal conspiracy, cheating, criminal breach of trust and forgery. They have been accused of defrauding at least 670 home buyers of Rs 164 crore.

According to the charge sheet, the company and its directors hatched a ""criminal conspiracy"" to cheat people by collecting funds from prospective home buyers in advance against flats booked in their real estate projects.

The company did not adhere to the agreed obligation of providing possession of the flats in time and ""defrauded"" the general public, the anti-money laundering agency said.

The ED claimed its probe revealed the funds were collected by Supertech Limited and other group companies from home buyers.

The company also took project-specific term loans from banks and financial institutions for the purpose of construction of housing projects, the ED said.

However, these funds were ""misappropriated and diverted"" for buying land in the name of other group companies which were pledged as collateral to borrow funds from banks and financial institutions, it added.

The Supertech group also defaulted on payments to banks and financial institutions rendering around Rs 1,500 crore of such loans non-performing assets, the agency said.

Supertech Ltd, which was formed in 1988, has so far delivered around 80,000 apartments, mainly in the Delhi-NCR region. The company is currently developing around 25 projects across the National Capital Region (NCR). It is yet to give possession to more than 20,000 buyers.

The company has been plagued by a crisis since last August when its nearly 100-metre twin towers - Apex and Ceyane - located on the Noida Expressway were demolished following an order of the Supreme Court which found they were constructed within the Emerald Court premises in violation of norms.

Arora had then said the company incurred a loss of about Rs 500 crore, including in construction and interest costs, because of the demolition.

The company suffered another blow in March last year when the Delhi bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) ordered initiation of insolvency proceedings against Supertech Ltd on a petition filed by the Union Bank of India for non-payment of dues of around Rs 432 crore.

Supertech challenged the order before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).

In June 2022, the NCLAT ordered the commencement of insolvency proceedings in only one of the housing projects of Supertech Ltd and not the entire company.

The NCLAT also ordered constitution of a Committee of Creditors for the firm's Eco Village 2 project located in Greater Noida (West).

The company got permission from the Supreme Court to arrange around Rs 1,600 crore from institutional investors to complete 18 housing projects across Delhi-NCR being built under the main firm Supertech Ltd.

Apart from these 18, some other housing projects are being executed by different companies in the Supertech Group.

Adi kekir is a variety of ginger produced in the East Siang, Siang and Upper Siang districts. It is known for its taste and size.

Handmade carpets prepared by the Tibetan refugees who live in various parts of the state are famous for their typical designs, motifs and textures.

Wanchoo wooden craft items are unique as they feature human heads -- tobacco pipes with head-shaped bowls and drinking mugs with warriors carrying heads. The artisans also create sculptures of Lord Buddha, animals, and dolls.

The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) is supporting the initiative of the state government to promote these products, and is also providing financial assistance, officials said.

Of the 18 such products supported by NABARD for GI registration, six products have received the certification so far. Earlier, Yak Churpi -- cheese prepared from the milk of Arunachali yak, Khamti rice -- a variety of sticky rice produced in Namsai district, and Tangsa textile of Changlang district, received the GI tags.

In a statement, Religare Enterprises Ltd (REL) said the approval sought at the AGM of RFL (Religare Finvest Ltd) held on September 26, 2023 was to seek enabling approval of shareholders for the proposed grant of ESOPs of RFL to Rashmi Saluja under the RFL ESOP Plan 2019.

RFL is a subsidiary of Religare Enterprises. REL chairperson Saluja is also chairperson and MD of RFL.

At the AGM of RFL, the shareholders ""amongst other things passed the Special Resolution (Item no. 5) for approval for grant of 2,14,11,555 options under RFL ESOP Plan 2019 to CMD (Saluja), equivalent or exceeding to 1 per cent of the current issued share capital of RFL"".

""Subsequent to the passing of enabling special resolution by the shareholders of RFL with respect to 'Item No 5', RFL has not placed any proposal with NRC till date for grant of above mentioned ESOPs to CMD. Since no new shares were issued/allotted in the matter, there is no contravention of the Reg 26 (6) of the SEBI Takeover Regulations,"" the company said in a statement.

Earlier in the day, Burman family called for an investigation into the alleged allotment of 8 per cent share of RFL to REL Chairman Rashmi Saluja.

""The allotment of approximately 2.14 crore shares, constituting (around) 8 per cent of Religare Finvest Ltd (RFL), to Rashmi Saluja through Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) requires investigation in terms of compliance with SEBI Takeover Regulations,"" a statement from the Burman family spokesperson said.

Terming the allotment as ""unfortunate"", the Burman family, the largest shareholder of REL in which it collectively owns 21.24 per cent through its entities, said the process ""raises a question mark on the management and the independence of the independent directors"" of the diversified financial services firm.

The Burman family, the promoter of Dabur India and other entities such as Eveready Industries, had in September announced a Rs 2,116 crore open offer to the shareholders of Religare Enterprises Ltd (REL) to acquire up to 26 per cent stake in the company.

""It is unfortunate that a solitary executive has cornered a significant quantum of remuneration through ESOPs at REL, Care Health Insurance Limited, and RFL, all without approval and requisite disclosure to REL shareholders,"" the Burman family spokesperson said.

Further, the spokesperson said, ""This raises a question mark on the management and the independence of the independent directors and their complicity in such unjustified dole outs.""

Rashmi Saluja is also the Chairperson and Managing Director (CMD) of Religare Finvest.

When contacted, REL asserted its board upholds the highest standards of corporate governance and compliances in all transactions and stands by its management.

According to a media report, Saluja got allotted approximately 2.14 crore shares, constituting 8 per cent of RFL, an unlisted subsidiary of REL, through ESOPs, a day after the Burman family announced an open offer to buy additional shares for the control of the conglomerate.

""REL board should answer the shareholders whether there exist more instances of ESOP issuances to entities and potential conflicts of interest. These actions have eroded trust and confidence in the REL board, necessitating an urgent need to restore credibility,"" the Burman family spokesperson said.

The ESOP shares are valued at around Rs 250 crore and is the bone of contention between Religare board led by Saluja and the Burman family, which has invested around Rs 900 crore to Rs 1,000 crore into the financial service provider.

Earlier, Burman family had approached market regulator SEBI through its entities, seeking a probe into the sale of shares by Chairman Rashmi Saluja of the diversified financial services day after they informed about the open offer.

Later, some independent directors from Religare also raised their concerns over the open offer from Burmans and approached the market regulator.

Burman family had also alleged vested interests are attempting to block their acquisition of a stake in REL, after two senior members were booked in the multi-crore Mahadev app case. The family had said it is shocked by what it termed as an ""arm twisting"" move and denied any involvement in the case.

In the AGM of Religare Finvest, which took place on September 26, a special resolution was placed for issuance of 2.14 crore shares to Rashmi Saluja, Chairman and Managing Director of the company, through ESOPs

As the allotment was exceeding the prescribed limit of one per cent of the total issued share capital of the company, a special resolution was needed, said the notice of the said AGM."

Then you have come to the right place! While it’s impossible to completely cut out stress, it’s not impossible to have better mental health this year.

Wondering how to make your life less stressful in 2024? Read on to find out!

Try Not To Think About Things Beyond Control
We know it’s easier said than done. And for those who are chronic worriers with a tendency to fret about everything, it’s almost asking the impossible. However, it’s best if we try not to obsess over things we have little control over - such as chronic illnesses, relationships, and promotions. Pondering too much on them may not change outcomes but will surely do a number on your mental well-being!

Get Some Sleep
Several studies show that having quality shut-eye time can do wonders for our mental health!

If you are someone with insomnia, try to make the environment conducive to sleep. Turn off the lights, and put on some soothing music, or visit the channel of your favourite ASMR expert on YouTube.

You can also get supplements such as melatonin (10 mg) before bedtime.

Notice The Warning Signs
In some cases, people tend to worry/obsess more about a particular aspect of their life. So if you find yourself thinking too much about something and it begins to have physical manifestations such as increased heart rate, restlessness, lack of hunger, etc, it's time to address it.

Look For A Distraction
If you find yourself getting attacked by negative thoughts often, look for a distraction. Read a book, or solve a puzzle.

Don’t Fret About What Could Have Been
It's a human tendency to regret bad decisions and ruminate over what could have been. However, try not to spend too about what you could have done better, or how you could have prevented a tragedy.

Cultivate Gratitude
The more you learn to feel grateful and thankful for your lot, or whenever the stars align and things go right for you, the happier you will be.

Log Out For A While
Spending more time on social media, especially on websites such as LinkedIn can affect your mental health, as you will often see people who have received acceptances to your dream universities, have been blessed with promotions, or have bagged their dream jobs. This can lead some people to develop an inferiority complex.

While LinkedIn is still invaluable for making professional connections and applying for jobs, try not to spend too much time on it."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/ind-ra-ups-indias-fy24-growth-estimates-to-6-7-pc-on-economic-resilience-prospect-of-private-capex/articleshow/106522341.cms,"New Delhi, India Ratings and Research on Wednesday upped GDP growth estimate for current fiscal to 6.7 per cent, from 6.2 per cent, citing resilient economy, sustained government capex and prospect of a new private corporate capex cycle. It flagged weak global growth and trade as risks which weighed down the growth estimates, besides volatile geopolitical situation.

""All these risks will continue to weigh on and restrict India's GDP growth to 6.7 per cent in FY24. The quarterly GDP growth, which came in at 7.8 per cent YoY and 7.6 per cent YoY in 1QFY24 and 2QFY24 respectively, is slated to slow down sequentially in the remaining two quarters of FY24,"" Ind-Ra Principal Economist Sunil Kumar Sinha said.

The RBI also expects a sequential slowdown in the GDP growth in the remaining two quarters and expects the overall FY24 GDP to come in at 7 per cent.

The Indian economy grew 7.2 per cent in 2022-23 fiscal.

In a statement, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said it has revised up its GDP growth estimate for FY24 to 6.7 per cent from earlier 6.2 per cent.

This has been led by a number of factors -- the resilience of the Indian economy; sustained government capex; deleveraged balance sheet of corporates/banking sector; prospect of a new private corporate capex cycle; and sustained momentum in business and software services exports, coupled with remittances from the rest of the world.

Highlighting that consumption demand is not broad based, Ind-Ra said wage growth is critical for consumption growth.

Ind-Ra's calculation shows that a 1 per cent increase in real wages could lead to a 1.12 per cent increase in the real private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) and the multiplier effect of this could result in a 64 basis point increase in the GDP growth.

However, the data shows that the real wage growth of households belonging to the lower income bracket was marginally negative in second quarter (July-September) of current fiscal. On the other hand, the real wage growth of households belonging to the upper income bracket grew 6.4 per cent YoY in the second quarter of FY24.

""As a result, the current consumption demand is skewed in favour of the goods and services consumed largely by the households belonging to the upper income bracket. Ind-Ra believes sustained real wage growth of the households belonging to lower income bracket is an imperative for a sustainable and broad-based recovery in consumption demand,"" it said.

Ind-Ra expects PFCE, which denotes money spent by individuals on goods and services for personal consumption, to grow 5.2 per cent year on year in current fiscal, as against 7.5 per cent in last fiscal.

The PFCE growth which increased to 6 per cent in the first quarter, again declined to 3.1 per cent YoY in second quarter of current fiscal.

However, PFCE growth in the second half (October-March) will benefit from the base effect. Last year in October-March period PFCE growth was 2.5 per cent.

With regard to inflation, Ind-Ra said it expects the average retail and wholesale inflation (WPI) to come in at 5.3 per cent and 0.6 per cent, respectively, in FY24.

""Ind-Ra believes unless the inflation stabilises around 4 per cent mark, the RBI might not go for monetary easing and therefore remain in the pause mode on the repo rate front in the near term,"" it said.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/uk/can-virtual-gang-rape-occur-in-the-metaverse-uk-police-launch-investigation/articleshow/106520687.cms,"UK authorities are currently conducting a groundbreaking investigation into the first-ever reported case of an alleged rape that took place inside a virtual reality (VR) game, also known as a ""metaverse.""

The incident involves a sixteen-year-old girl who was distressed to witness her virtual avatar being targeted for an online ""gang-rape"" by unidentified individuals.

Despite no physical harm being done, the young girl experienced emotional and psychological trauma comparable to an actual assault. This distressing incident occurred during an immersive gaming session while the victim was wearing a virtual reality headset. The specific game in question remains unknown.

The impact on the victim's mental health has raised serious concerns about the handling of virtual offenses. While this technology offers unique and exciting possibilities, it also presents new challenges in terms of ensuring safety and preventing harm. This case underscores the urgent need for effective policing and regulation within virtual worlds to safeguard users, particularly minors, from such traumatic experiences.

The UK police investigation aims to identify and bring the perpetrators responsible for this virtual assault to justice. Authorities are also considering the broader implications of this incident for the policing of virtual offenses. As virtual reality becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, it is crucial to establish clear guidelines and mechanisms to address and prevent such incidents from occurring.

In response to this incident, virtual reality gaming communities and industry experts have expressed their concerns and commitment to ensuring a safe and enjoyable experience for all users. They stress the importance of reporting any suspicious or harmful activities within virtual environments and encourage users to familiarize themselves with the safety features and guidelines provided by game developers.

The traumatic experience endured by the sixteen-year-old victim serves as a powerful reminder of the potential risks associated with virtual reality.

As technology continues to advance, it is vital for law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and the industry to collaborate and establish effective measures to tackle the unique challenges posed by virtual offenses. The ongoing investigation into this case will be closely monitored as it sets a precedent for future incidents involving virtual crimes.

After facing consecutive defeats, the Lakers aim to kick off 2024 on a positive note, hoping to improve upon their performance at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the Miami Heat are on a West Coast road trip, having played against the Golden State Warriors, Utah Jazz, and Los Angeles Clippers in recent days.

Miami, having lost its last two games, stays in LA for the match against the Lakers before heading to Phoenix. There's a possibility that star guard Jimmy Butler might be absent again due to a foot injury, having missed Monday night's game against the Clippers. The Lakers, on the other hand, anticipate having their key players available for Wednesday's matchup, although guards Cam Reddish (groin), Gabe Vincent (knee), and D'Angelo Russell (tailbone) are listed as day-to-day.

Over the past 10 games, the Lakers have faced challenges, losing seven of them and allowing an average of 119.9 points per contest. In contrast, the Miami Heat have a 6-4 record in their last 10 games, averaging 114.0 points while allowing 112.8 points per game.

The battle in the paint will be crucial, especially if Jimmy Butler is sidelined. Lakers' center Anthony Davis has been performing impressively, averaging 25.3 points, 12.3 rebounds, and 2.6 blocks per game over the past 10 matches. Meanwhile, Heat's center Bam Adebayo has showcased his skills with averages of 22.0 points and 10.4 rebounds during the same period.

Despite the notable contributions from Davis and Adebayo, LeBron James remains the focal point, averaging 20.6 points per game in his last 10 outings and scoring 34 points in the Lakers' loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on Dec. 31.

This marks the second encounter between these teams this season, with the Heat securing a narrow 108-107 victory on Nov. 7. In that game, Butler led Miami with 28 points, supported by Adebayo and Tyler Herro adding 22 each. James contributed 30 points for the Lakers, with Austin Reaves adding 23.

Anticipation builds as we await potential historic moments, such as Novak Djokovic's pursuit of becoming the greatest major winner in tennis history. The new year kicks off with a bang, with the Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk clash, marking the first undisputed heavyweight bout in a quarter-century.

As we bid farewell to the old and welcome the bold, the sporting calendar kicks into high gear right from the start. Ronnie O'Sullivan seeks his record-extending eighth Masters snooker title at Alexandra Palace in London, while Djokovic eyes an astonishing 11th victory at the Australian Open in Melbourne.

Djokovic's remarkable feat of winning three out of four Grand Slams last season puts him on the verge of surpassing Margaret Court's record with 25 major titles. However, the returning Rafael Nadal, a 22-time Grand Slam winner, adds another layer of excitement to the tennis scene after recovering from a hip injury.

Football fans look forward to seeing Mohamed Salah in action at the Africa Cup of Nations, offering him a shot at redemption after losing the final two years ago. The sporting drama reaches new heights with the clash between unbeaten heavyweights Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk, marking the first undisputed world heavyweight fight since 1999.

The year promises more excitement with the UEFA Champions League final, UEFA European Championship in Germany, Tour de France, and the XXXIII Olympic Games in France taking center stage. Questions linger: Will Jude Bellingham lead Real Madrid to a 15th victory in football's biggest club tournament? Can Manchester City secure back-to-back European Cup wins at Wembley?

As England's new golden generation, inspired by Bellingham, aims to claim a major trophy in Germany after the Euro 2020 heartbreak, cycling enthusiasts wonder if the 'Manx missile,' Mark Cavendish, will overtake Eddy Merckx as the most prolific stage winner in Tour de France history.

The spotlight also shines on Team GB, set to deliver another inspiring performance at the Olympic Games in Paris. Athletes like Adam Peaty, Katarina Johnson-Thompson, Zharnel Hughes, Dina Asher-Smith, Keely Hodgkinson, Jessica Gadirova, Josh Kerr, and Sky Brown are tipped to vie for medals, continuing the nation's strong Olympic legacy after claiming 22 golds and 64 medals at Tokyo 2020.

As per the provisions of the RERA Act and pursuant to other legal agreements/ contracts, there is no justification of super area.

Sale of apartments on this basis will be considered illegal and according to the provisions of RERA Act, buying and selling of apartments is legal only on the basis of carpet area.

U.P. RERA Chairman Sanjay Bhoosreddy said that ""there is no abbreviation or definition of super area in the RERA Act. It is necessary for allottees to consider carpet area as the actual area of the unit/ apartment and pay the promoter according to this area.""

According to the RERA Act 2016, developers mention number of units, types along with floor, balcony, terrace and area of other spaces while registering the project on the portal. In this, they mention actual area of floor space among internal walls.

For agreement for sale between promoter and allottee, a model agreement for sale has been provided on the UP RERA portal.

This model agreement for sale is also based on carpet area. In this way, selling apartments on the base of super area is contrary to the provisions of the RERA Act.

“Hence, promoters must ensure sale of units according to the Carpet Area only. Violation of this provision may cause legal action,” UP RERA has said.

""I really admire the United States of America but with all due respect, we are not another star in the American flag,"" Ben Gvir, who heads the ultranationalist Otzma Yehudit party, said in a statement.

He added, ""The United States is our best friend but before everything else, we will do what is good for the State of Israel: The emigration of hundreds of thousands from Gaza will allow residents [of the border area] to return home and live in security and protect IDF soldiers.""

Earlier, the United States strongly rejected the Israeli ministers' statements on the resettlement of Palestinians outside of Gaza and said that the rhetoric is ""inflammatory and irresponsible.""

The US State Department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said in a press statement that the US has always been clear on the fact that Gaza is Palestinian land and will remain theirs.

""The United States rejects recent statements from Israeli Ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir advocating for the resettlement of Palestinians outside of Gaza. This rhetoric is inflammatory and irresponsible,"" the statement read.

""We have been told repeatedly and consistently by the Government of Israel, including by the Prime Minister, that such statements do not reflect the policy of the Israeli government. They should stop immediately,"" it added.

He said that the kind of future the US seeks is that in the future, no terror groups can threaten Israel and Hamas has no control of Gaza.

""We have been clear, consistent, and unequivocal that Gaza is Palestinian land and will remain Palestinian land, with Hamas no longer in control of its future and with no terror groups able to threaten Israel. That is the future we seek, in the interests of Israelis and Palestinians, the surrounding region, and the world,"" Miller said, according to the press statement.

The statement from the US came in response to recent statements of Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who presented the migration of Palestinian civilians as a solution to the long-running conflict and as a prerequisite for securing the stability necessary to allow residents of southern Israel to return to their homes.

According to The Times of Israel, two prominent far-right leaders of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government on Monday supported the reconstruction of settlements in the Gaza Strip and the promotion of ""voluntary emigration"" of Palestinians, while opposition MK Avigdor Liberman, known for his hardline views, demanded that Israel retake southern Lebanon.

They spoke during their parties' respective faction meetings in the Knesset.

The Israel-Gaza conflict offers an ""opportunity to concentrate on encouraging the migration of the residents of Gaza,"" Ben Gvir told reporters, calling such a policy ""a correct, just, moral and humane solution,"" according to The Times of Israel.

""We cannot withdraw from any territory we are in in the Gaza Strip. Not only do I not rule out Jewish settlement there, I believe it is also an important thing,"" Gvir said.

Meanwhile, Smotrich told members of his party and the Knesset that the ""correct solution"" to the ongoing Gaza conflict is ""to encourage the voluntary migration of Gaza's residents to countries that will agree to take in the refugees.

""Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the international community have strongly opposed the ""resettlement"" of Palestinians from Gaza, a demand made by several parliamentarians, including cabinet members.

The conflict in Gaza escalated after the October 7 attack by Hamas, where about 2,500 terrorists breached the border into Israel from the Gaza Strip, leading to casualties and the seizure of hostages.

Israel, since the war began, has characterised its Gaza offensive as targeting Hamas' infrastructure to eliminate the entire terror group while making efforts to minimise civilian casualties.

Reportedly, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claimed that over 20,000 people have been killed in the Strip during the war, an unverified figure that also does not differentiate between combatants and civilians and does not take into account those killed as a consequence of terror groups' own rocket misfires.

Whereas, recently, the Israeli forces identified several launches from Lebanon towards the area of Adamit in northern Israel on Monday. According to Israeli assessments, troops have killed some 8,500 terror operatives since the war began.

Moreover, another 1,000 Hamas terrorists were killed in Israel on or in the days after the October 7 attack.

Police searched Sahu's residence and seized a laptop and other gadgets. The house belongs to Sahu's mother, said DCP, Zone II, Rahul Madne.

Police had arrested Sahu and four others in the 2023 murder case.

Khan, 34, was the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) minority cell's functionary in Nagpur. Khan's mother Mehrunisha, a resident of Awasthi Nagar here, had lodged a missing person's complaint when her daughter went untraceable after leaving for Jabalpur on August 1, 2023, to meet Sahu.

Sahu was later arrested and told the police that Khan was his wife and he murdered her over monetary and personal issues before dumping her body in a river in Jabalpur, police had said.

Despite an exhaustive search operation, Khan's body was never recovered.

Police had said that Sahu led a gang in which Khan was used as a honey-trap. The gang used to target male victims and send Khan to them to extort money.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/marvel-to-release-civil-war-2-details-here/articleshow/106521111.cms,"A poster of a possible sequel of MCU's Captain America: Civil War is being circulated online, which has left many fans guessing on whether this is true or not. Marvel is at present going through uncertain times, after a year filled with projects which are not received so well along with the suspension of Jonathan Majors, who was about to play the lead role in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and is currently listed as Avengers 5.

In the year 2024, MCU is going to witness Deadpool 3, only one cinematic release. As per reports, few other projects are also written in part or rewritten in entirety, leaving fans in a state of great uncertainty about when they will see their most-loved characters next.

Will there be a Civil War 2 movie?
Despite the poster which is being circulated online, it is not confirmed yet about Civil War II in MCU. An Instagram user going by the name @marvels.wolverine, has created the poster and it is not genuine. Previously Alex P of @MyCosmicCircus has spread the news that indicated the probability of a Civil War II before the Avengers projects, however it is a rumor.

What will a theoretical Civil War 2 revolve around?
In the case of a Captain America: Civil War sequel, it will be based on the events of Civil War II. In that scenario, several key plot points of that comic will require some adjustments to align with the MCU collection.
Iron Man (Tony Stark) and Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers), have led the two sides of the official Civil War.
With the absence of Tony, some other superhero needs to replace him, bringing up the second problem of the MCU – the scarcity of Inhumans.

The main plot of Civil War II is that there is an inhuman who has the power to look at the future.

According to Carol, in the case of that inhuman knowing when somebody will be committing a crime or lead to harm, the Avengers should be taking that person down based on their predicted actions. On the other hand, Tony thinks putting people under arrest based on what they have not done is not justified. This is debatable as Inhumans have not been introduced by the main universe of MCU yet. Black Bolt made its appearance in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, however, it was an alternative universe.

In the case of a movie based on the event of Civil War II to be made, it has to wait till someone takes the place of Tony in the conflict and for the introduction of the Inhumans or it will take its inspiration from the comic with the same name as its.

Captain America: Civil War can be streamed online on Disney+.

FAQs:
Q1. Which poster is circulating online on social media?
A1. A poster of a possible sequel of the MCU's Captain America: Civil War has been circulated online, leaving fans guessing on whether this is true or not. An Instagram user going by the name @marvels.wolverine, has created the poster and is not genuine.

He told reporters in Udupi that due to space constraints inside the temple, many Ram Bhakts including saints, chiefs of mutts, people's representatives and donors could not be invited for the consecration. No one should think the Ram Mandir is BJP's temple, he said, adding that all devotees will get an opportunity to have darshan of Lord Ram Lalla from the next day of the consecration.

""It is a temple that belongs to all Indians and built with people's money collected from devotees all over the world,"" he said. Devotees should not feel slighted if they have not been given invitations, he reiterated.

The Swami said those who have been invited should certainly be part of the ceremony. Many tents and sheds have been erected for devotees to stay on the premises from the next day as it will be difficult for people to sleep out in the open in the biting cold, he said.

Expressing displeasure at the recent arrest of a 'kar sevak' in Hubballi, he claimed that it is a part of an effort to sideline Hindus. The state government should clear the misgivings and confusion among the people in this regard, he said.

The Pejawar seer also said he backed Udupi MLA Yashpal Suvarna's demand to declare January 22, the day of 'Prana Pratishta' at Ayodhya as a public holiday, respecting the faith and sentiments of Hindus.

Over 4.52 lakh cyber crime cases were reported on the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal (NCRP) in 2021, which rose by 113.7% in 2022, with 9.66 lakh cases being reported on the portal, director of I4C Rajesh Kumar told reporters in an interaction.

I4C is a body established by the Ministry of Home Affairs to provide a framework and eco-system for law enforcement agencies for dealing with Cybercrime in a coordinated and comprehensive manner.

Kumar said over 15.56 lakh cases were reported on NCRP in 2023, translating into 129 cyber crime cases reported per lakh population, which shows a ""deceleration"" of growth rate to 60.9% as compared to 2022.

""Rs 10,319 crore has been reportedly lost in India from April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2023... We have managed to block Rs 1127 crore, of which 9-10% has been restored in the accounts of the victims,"" Kumar said.

Giving details of cyber criminals, officials said around 50% of cyber attacks are being committed by ""gangs"" operating from Cambodia, Vietnam, China and other countries.

Citing difficulties in restoring amounts to the accounts of victims, Kumar said the government is framing new Standard Operating Procedures which are likely to come out soon to make it easier for victims to claim their money.

Right now, a victim has to get a court order to get their money back with states like Gujarat and Karnataka leading the way where people are approaching Lok Adalats and magistrates to get their money.

Highlighting trends of cyber criminals, Kumar said regions near Delhi are using Sextortion, online booking, OLX related crimes to trick the victims.

Gangs operating from Jharkhand, etc, are using KYC expiry, Anrdroid banking Malware-type online scams to siphon off money from gullible individuals.

He said other major cyber crimes are duping people of their money using investment applications and websites offering part-time jobs and Ponzi schemes, illegal lending applications and customer care centres.

There were also vases of Android malware fraud by seeking OTPs to take control of victims' systems, impersonation by taking over social media accounts and sextortion.

Listing recent successes against cyber criminals, Kumar said the Indian agency managed to thwart a major cyber attack targeting the G-20 website.

Every minute 66, lakh hits were made using bots through a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack to disable it by flooding it with hits.

Another success was when Indian agencies managed to bring back citizens from Myanmar, where they were taken in the lure of employment opportunities and held back against their will to commit cyber frauds across the globe, they said.

Recently, a new software, 'Pratibimb', has been made accessible to state police forces on a project level that will enable them to locate cybercriminals operating in their area.

The use of this software, coupled with quick reaction, has seen a massive reduction in cyber criminals operating from Jharkhand's Deoghar and Jamtara areas.

""The software gives the location of origin of the call, jurisdictional police officer takes action on that along with this information about the point of sale of SIM.

""Police officers in Jamtara and Deoghar are taking action on such information, which has resulted in 454 arrests last month,"" Kumar said."

Surya met the Minister in Delhi and also requested him to visit the city soon for an inspection of the Namma Metro projects.

Posting about his meeting with Puri on social media platform X, Surya said: “Bengaluru Metro needs a full-time MD to lead its operations. Without a full-time leader, most of the critical work, including the Yellow Line, is getting delayed.”

His demand came in the wake of the government assigning the additional charge of Rural Development & Panchayat Raj to BMRCL MD Anjum Parwez.

Surya accused Chief Minister Siddaramaiah of not being serious about appointing a full-time MD for the Metro organisation. “The state government seems least bothered about the delay and the cost overruns of NammaMetro, despite multiple reminders.""

Puri assured him of a visit to Bengaluru soon. “I also requested him to visit Bengaluru to take stock of the status of all Metro projects, including the all important airport line. He assured me that he will visit our city soon. Will keep you all updated on the progress.”

The Yellow line spans 18.8-km connecting RV Road with Bommasandra through 16 stations. It connects two ends of Bengaluru South constituency and important IT/BT and industrial corridors. The MP inspected the progress of the Yellow Line in October, which revealed supply issues with the rolling stock for the metros.

The BMRCL had said the line would be ready by February 2024. Surya also found that another impediment for starting services in early 2024 was the delivery of the Train Control Management System (TCMS) software, expected only by June 2024. The MP expressed doubts over the BMRCL meeting the February 2024 deadline.

The MP has also been pushing for the early approval for the Phase 3 of the Metro from Vega City Junction (JP Nagar 4th Phase) to Kadabagere on Magadi Road. He met the Minister in this regard in August 2023 and has been regularly following up for further updates.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/fog-ahead-experts-say-refrain-from-speeding-use-blinkers-be-attentive/articleshow/106521012.cms,"Refrain from speeding, avoid abrupt mid-road stops unless absolutely necessary and use indicators. These are some of the expert suggestions to drivers battling dense fog in the winters. The precautions become more important with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting dense fog days this week over parts of east, northwest and north India, including Delhi-NCR.

Since the onset of winters, the country has seen many road accidents, including pile-ups, due to foggy conditions, and these have left several people dead or injured.

On December 27 last year, several commuters were injured in a pile-up on the Yamuna Expressway in Uttar Pradesh's Greater Noida, while a day later, 28 people were injured when a roadways bus collided head-on with a truck on a highway in Bareilly.

In the latest major accident because of low visibility due to fog, 12 people were killed and around 30 injured on January 3 in a head-on collision between a coal-laden truck and a bus on the National Highway-715 in Assam's Golaghat.

The truck was coming from the direction of Jorhat and on the wrong side as a portion of the four-lane highway was damaged. The bus was on the right track, an official of the Dergaon police station said. He added that ""there was fog and both the vehicles were speeding"".

Founder and CEO, SaveLIFE Foundation, Piyush Tewari said ""a critical aspect to bear in mind during foggy conditions is refraining from speeding"".

""Fog can create a misleading sense of slow motion, masking actual high speeds. With foggy conditions necessitating abrupt stoppages, only low speed may prevent accidents,"" he said.

During foggy months, drivers should also consciously opt for driving on low-beam as high-beam is reflected back by fog, the CEO of the road safety organisation said.

""During fog, the chances of rear-end collisions are high. To prevent such collisions, we must avoid sudden turns or mid-road stoppage in fog. Using blinkers while stalled and moving away from your stalled vehicle is a good way to stay safe,"" Tewari said.

Transport and traffic police departments of several states, including Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana, as well as Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir have, over the last month, issued fog advisories asking people to drive carefully.

The Delhi Traffic Police had recently advised people to drive with their vehicle's tail lights on, honk periodically and not overtake while passing through dense fog. It also advised that drivers keep their vehicle's windows and mirrors clean, and use defroster and windscreen wipers.

Similar advisories were also issued by other states. These also cautioned people against getting distracted and driving under the influence of alcohol.

""Foggy conditions demand patience and attention on the road, speeding or improper overtaking during this period can pose extreme dangers,"" Tewari said.

In 2022, there were 34,262 road accidents due to misty and foggy weather conditions, compared to 28,934 in 2021, according to a report of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways titled ""Road Accidents in India-2022"".

It also stated that 14,583 people were killed and 30,796 injured in 2022 in these accidents due to misty and foggy weather. In 2021, 13,372 people were killed and 25,360 injured.

Due to hail or sleet, the report said, there were 4,083 road accidents in 2022, compared to 3,911 in 2021. In 2022, the death figure due to accidents in this weather condition was 1,871 in 2022 against 1,872 in 2021.

The data was given under the report's ""Road Accidents by Weather Conditions"" section.

The report, however, mentioned that the data of road accidents for 2022, showed almost three-fourths of accidents and fatalities took place under sunny or clear weather conditions.

""The accidents under adverse weather conditions such as rainy, foggy and hail/sleet accounted for 16.6 per cent of total road accidents during 2022,"" it said. There were a total of 4,61,312 accidents 2022, the report stated.

""In the year 2023, within the jurisdiction of the Hubballi-Dharwad Commissionerate, 36 people were arrested in connection with crimes including marijuana sales, theft, extortion, fraud, and gambling. Srikanth Poojari is the 32nd person on this list. Should he be released just because he is a kar sevak, or should he be arrested for being a suspect,"" Siddaramaiah asked. ""The BJP's protest is not against our government, but against the country's law and constitution.""

The CM sought to know from the BJP that if those involved in criminal activities claimed to be protectors of religion and indulged in murder and extortion, would the party leaders support them too. ""The arrest of Srikanth Poojari during the inauguration of the Ram Mandir is merely a coincidence. While reviewing old cases, the police arrested him along with 36 others. There is neither revenge nor appeasement in this. The law has been enforced, and it has been done so in the interest of the public.""

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/jeffrey-epsteins-islands-under-rebranding-and-image-makeover/articleshow/106502896.cms,"Alleged pedophile Jeffrey Epstein's property in the US Virgin Islands, known for his scandals, is under renovations, image makeover and rebranding. After billionaire Stephen Deckoff bought the Caribbean Islands of Great St. James and Little St. James for $60 million, he ordered for reconstruction of many parts. He hopes to inaugurate the new attraction sometime in 2025.

Sold in 2022
Earlier in 2021, these small islands were listed for $125 million, with the bulk of the proceeds supporting compensation efforts for Epstein’s victims. But the islands could not attract a buyer, and the price was slashed to $110 million in 2022 before Deckoff pounced in May of last year.

Jeffrey Epstein, who hung himself in a Manhattan jail cell in 2018, allegedly hosted a parade of prominent figures he brought to the site over many years. Hundreds of women from across the world came forward to complain that they were trafficked to the islands and abused. They said that they were promised modeling contracts or better lives by Epstein or one of his cohorts, like ex-girlfriend and fixer Ghislaine Maxwell. Most of them were underage at that time.

'Epstein Island'
'Epstein Island' includes a helipad, private dock, gas station, high-capacity water filtration, 2 pools, the main compound, 4 guest villas, 3 private beaches, a gym, a tiki hut and other structures.

Rebranding
Now, developers plan to convert the property into a glittering hotel. Talking to the 'Financial Times', Deckoff said, ""I have been proud to call the US Virgin Islands home for more than a decade and am tremendously pleased to be able to bring the area a world-class destination befitting its natural grace and beauty.""

He has increased his sprawling real estate portfolio with the purchases of 165-acre Great St. James Bay and 70-acre Little St. James Bay. He lives in a $12 million waterfront estate in St. John's Peter Bay and owns other trophy properties in Beverly Hills and New York.

Jeffrey Epstein bought Little St. James, which would become the center of his misconduct, for $7.95 million in 1998. He later also bought Great St. James in 2016 for nearly $20 million.

Epstein greeted several high-powered global figures at the property, including former President Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and UK's Prince Andrew.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/taxing-times-why-are-so-many-companies-getting-gst-notices/articleshow/106520390.cms,"On the New Year day, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) got a demand notice of about Rs 806 crore for alleged short payment of Goods and Services Tax (GST) for 2017-18. LIC has received the communication/demand order on Monday for collection of GST along with interest and penalty for Maharashtra state. A day later. LIC was slapped with another tax demand, this time for Telangana state.

Yesterday, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) said it has received a GST demand with penalties of Rs 447.5 crore from authorities of five states over issues such as disallowance of GST credit and salaries including allowances paid to expats. Last week, food-delivery platform Zomato said it received notices from the tax authorities in Delhi and Karnataka over alleged short payment of GST in 2018 amounting to Rs 4.2 crore.

Eicher Motors, Asian Paints, Nestle India and ICICI Pru are some of the other dozens of big companies that have received tax demand notices for the GST payment. The flurry of GST notices have stunned the corporates. These notices are for the recovery of tax liabilities, whether due to non-payment, underpayment, or erroneous claim of input tax credit, for the financial years 2018-19 and 2019-20. Last week, the government gave GST officers more time to issue demand notices for discrepancies in annual returns for 2018-19 and 2019-20 financial years. On Thursday, the government extended the deadline in this regard for 2018-19 fiscal to April 30, 2024 and for 2019-20 fiscal to August 31, 2024.

The gaming industry is facing a tax demand of around Rs 1.5 lakh crore; the insurance industry is contesting a demand of over Rs 5,500 crore; and the real estate sector has received a demand of over Rs 2,000 crore.

The tax authorities have been shooting off tax demand notices for several months now. Tax officers sent around 33,000 GST notices to businesses for discrepancies in returns filed and short payment of taxes in 2017-18 and 2018-19 financial years, a CBIC official told ET in early December.

Notices worry companies
While these tax notices have become a source of worry for companies on various counts (even though they don't impact business of these companies), they are slowing down mergers and acquisitions (M&As). India Inc is now going back to the drawing board to account for tax liabilities before inking deals and finalising other business transactions.

Several M&As are understood to have been delayed or put on the backburner as tax experts assist companies in figuring out the impact of GST on proposed deals, ET has reported. Many companies have also approached various high courts challenging these GST notices.

For multinationals, so-called secondment remains an issue. Essentially, GST authorities are seeking to tax Indian units of MNCs that are paying salaries to expatriates, on grounds that this constitutes provision of a service to the parent.

Several highly placed officials in top corporations confirmed to ET in November, on condition of anonymity, that there had been a surge in GST notices recently, to which the managements had to devote a considerable amount of time. The chairman of a leading conglomerate said that while GST, introduced in 2017, sought to simplify the tax system and encourage compliance, there was no clarity on why and how the tax was being levied on transactions. ""Today, so many resources are wasted on understanding demands and clarifying with concerned officials. Notices, which we have to clarify, should not be sent by multiple authorities,"" he said.

Gopal Krishna Mundhra, partner at Economic Laws Practice (ELP), had told ET, ""Several thousands of system-generated notices have been sent to taxpayers without specific allegation and without any application of human mind, merely on the basis of mismatch between GSTR1, GSTR 3B, GSTR 2A, GSTR 9, e-way bills and some reports generated through GST portal."" He said these notices lack clarity on tax applicability. ""Also, many taxpayers are... (receiving) notices issued by multiple authorities on the same subject. Corporates are agonising over this,"" said Mundhra, adding that they were seeking legal recourse, wasting significant time and energy to counter the unwanted litigation.

Why the tax notices are raining
The GST officials say the reason behind a sudden surge in notices is because they could be time-barred. ""The law came into effect in 2017,"" an official told ET. ""However, the government offered relaxation during the pandemic. But now, with the pandemic behind us and many cases getting time-barred, a slew of show cause notices (SCNs) were issued before September 30. This was done with the purpose that there is no litigation on the ground of time-barring,"" said a senior government official.

Exemptions and relaxations during Covid times led to piling up of tax demands. And if the motices are nits ent now, the cases could be time-barred later. Experts say the notices will lead to litigation as many concepts are vague, and both regulator and assessee have no clarity.

A flood of GST notices can also be attributed to technology. Tax authorities use technology to issue thousands of time-sensitive notices at the click of a button. An automated return scrutiny module is integrated into a backend application that leverages data analytics to identify discrepancies and risks in GST returns. Consequently, discrepancies in statutory returns are flagged up and a system-generated scrutiny notice is issued to the taxpayer, ET has reported.

Another reason why so many companies got notices in the last months of 2023 was a looming deadline. For the fiscal 2018-19, the deadline December 31, 2023, which was extended to March 31, 2024.

An official had told PTI early last month that the GST appellate tribunal would be put in place in the next four-five months and efforts were being made to identify infrastructure, following which selection process of members would start.

A promo for the upcoming episode of the popular reality TV show has created some anticipation from fans as it shows Abhishek Kumar slapping co-contestant Samarth Jurel’s face during a showdown.


A Brief History Of The Slap
Things have not been very hunky-dory between Kumar, Jurel, and Isha Malviya.

Malviya and Jurel have often been shown to bully Kumar a lot, and even poking fun at his mental health issues. Malviya called Kumar ‘mental bhopu’ and he said, ""Tere pyaar mein he mental tha main. Tune mujhe mental karke chod diya,” (I was in love with you, you affected my mental health).

Later, Malviya even took potshots against his father. In one episode, she told other contestants that he was pretending to be claustrophobic to gain sympathy. When he tried to retaliate, Jurel staffed some paper in his mouth, which caused him to smack him across the face hard.

Earlier, Jurel had tried to take a dig at his father, implying he was a big disappointment to him, due to his mental health issues.

Although other contestants such as Ankita Lokhande and Arun Mashettey looked shell-shocked at Kumar’s outburst, some netizens came out in support of Kumar, pointing out that he was provoked.

“Glad Abhishek slapped him hard!! Doesn’t matter if he’s thrown out for violence but what Chintu and Isha are doing is totally wrong!” wrote one X user.

Another user tweeted, “Since three weeks this Chintu (Samarth Jurel) and Isha are continuously poking and instigating Abhishek… what can you expect from Abhishek? Of course, he'll lose his calm, he has anger issues. Glad that Abhishek slapped him… sukoon mila (Felt peaceful).”

Bollywood star Riteish Deshmukh also extended support to Kumar. “Heart goes out to Abhishek… Bigg Boss 17,” wrote the ‘Ek Villain’ star."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/bptp-acquires-land-in-gurgaon-for-rs-87-crore/articleshow/106520455.cms,"Realty developer BPTP purchased a land parcel spread across 228,000 in Gurgaon for Rs 87.27 crore.

BPTP has substantial holdings in Gurugram and Faridabad (about 600 acres) and has been acquiring land parcels in the region for residential and commercial development.

According to the documents accessed through CRE Matrix, a real estate data analytics firm, the land has been acquired by Countrywide Promoters Pvt Ltd, a subsidiary of BPTP Group and it has paid Rs 6.1 crore as stamp duty for the transaction.

Earlier, real estate developer Central Park had acquired a 10-acre land parcel from BPTP for Rs 100 crore.

BPTP has recently launched a plotted development project, BPTP District comprises residential plots ranging from 100-180 square yards in the prime real estate corridors of Sectors 81, 84, 85, and 86 in Faridabad.

BPTP has more than 30 residential projects and many commercial projects completed and delivered in Gurugram and Faridabad.

According to JLL, from January 2022 to October 2023, around 3,294 acres of land were acquired by real estate developers in the country. A substantial proportion (44.4%) of these land deals were transacted in Tier 2 and 3 cities, with a total of 1,461 acres being acquired across 17 separate land deals.

Data indicates that driven by the increasing demand and buying capacity of the customers, branded developers have successfully closed many land transactions in these cities.

Encouraged by the unprecedented levels of residential sales in emerging cities, developers are also acquiring land to build relevant supply pipelines for the future.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/investing-in-residential-or-commercial-properties-read-this-twitter-thread-on-real-estate-first/articleshow/106519745.cms,"In India, the age-old advice for investment often leans towards real estate. Jumping onto this bandwagon, an influencer recently advised her followers to consider Indian real estate. Tanya Khanijow, in a tweet, shared her recent experience of buying a commercial property as a future investment, sparking a deeper dive into the Indian real estate market. She provided insights for potential investors with a disclaimer urging them to conduct their own research.

""Recent reports suggest that India is set to urbanize at a rate of 50% by 2050, and those investing in tier-two cities stand to benefit. Considerations include commercial properties or land purchases in cities like Noida or Greater Noida. Additionally, explore residential, commercial, land, or other real estate investments in cities such as Bhubaneswar, Coimbatore, Indore, Jaipur, Kochi, Lucknow, Nagpur, Surat, Thiruvananthapuram, and Visakhapatnam,"" she recommended.

Khanijow also highlighted options like the purchase of land or leasing and rentals in picturesque locations across India, emphasizing their potential conversion into homestays, Airbnb units, or contributors to the tourism industry. Tier-two cities like Chandigarh, Vijayawada, Indore, Coimbatore, Visakhapatnam, and Nagpur were specifically mentioned for their rapid growth due to a robust industrial base, improved infrastructure, and large populations.

However, not everyone on Twitter agreed with her perspective.

A user named Aman Kharbas shared a contrasting experience with commercial real estate, narrating challenges with rent collection and property resale. Another user, Ashok Mehta, advocated for stocks over real estate, citing a better return on investment in his stock portfolio compared to his real estate ventures.

Drawing parallels between real estate and stocks, a Twitter user likened investing in tier 2 or 3 cities to investing in mid, small, or micro-cap stocks, where returns can vary significantly.

Despite the differing opinions, some users concurred with Khanijow's viewpoint. One user recommended places like Ahmedabad for potential real estate growth, while another emphasized the tax advantages and returns achieved through a real estate investment compared to the stock market.

The news comes just seven months after the Milwaukee-based startup acquired smaller rival Zencity. Frontdesk, operating in 30 U.S. markets with 1,200 units across 170 buildings, provides temporary homes for travelers and aimed to establish sustainable renting models.

The layoff, which affected full-time, part-time workers, and contractors, took place during a brief virtual meeting where CEO Jesse DePinto announced that the company would be filing for a state receivership as an alternative to bankruptcy, the report said. Citing an employee, the report said that layoff happened during “a two-minute Google Meet call.”

Frontdesk, founded in 2017, had raised approximately $26 million in funding from investors including JetBlue Ventures, Veritas Investments, and Sand Hill Angels. The startup recently attempted a bridge round to secure additional investment for their new plan of full building management, but unfortunately, the strategy did not succeed, leading to the company's inability to continue operations, the report said.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/12-exports-growth-by-2030-more-realistic-expectation-for-india-barclays/articleshow/106519978.cms,"Barclays on Wednesday said that a “more realistic expectation” would be for India’s exports to grow by around 12%, which would result in a global export share of around 4% by 2030, or $1.6 trillion from $0.75 trillion currently as against the target of $2 trillion or 15% growth.

The bank cautioned that weak global growth in the medium term, further fractures in global supply chains, and rising protectionism could challenge the strategy by limiting the potential for trade expansion.

India has been a key beneficiary of the
“China+1” strategy and that the tech-intensity of exports is gradually increasing. India’s export-complexity index rank has improved to 41 in 2023 from 46 in 2001 but compared with emerging market peers such as China (rank: 25) and Mexico (rank: 23), there is clearly a long way to go, it said.

“The biggest policy push is seen in , where India is slowly yet steadily moving up the , and seeing greater diversification. Still, India's largest goods exports themselves are highly reliant on imports,” said Rahul Bajoria, MD & Head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics, Barclays.

To reduce certain critical dependencies, the government has launched production-linked incentives, with “mixed success”, Barclays said while highlighting that growing and sustaining exports is necessary to boost medium-term growth and economic stability.

“While we are not arguing for an explicitly manufacturing or goods export-led growth model for India (given that it has already established its advantages in services), there needs to be an increased focus on raising India's goods-export profile, particularly in sectors that have higher elasticity to global growth,” Barclays said.

As per Barclays’ report, sectors in which India has historically had a comparative advantage particularly cotton and textiles, are now slowly losing sheen, in part due to the rise of other low-cost manufacturing competitors such as Bangladesh and Vietnam.

“However, it is important to note that India's top 3 exports, mineral fuels, gems and jewellery, and chemicals, have a large import-dependency,” it said.

In India’s free trade pacts, Barclays also highlighted the added dimension of exporting not just goods and services, but people, to further increase remittances.

Despite the multiple advantages of India’s export sector, there are two challenges to achieve the medium-term target of raising its global share in exports to 4-5%: global growth is expected to be slower relative to historical averages for most of this decade and a global shift towards ‘slowbalisation’.

Referring to policy changes such as the US’ CHIPS Act and semiconductor export restrictions on China, it said these suggest the conditions for global trade growth will be “markedly different” going ahead.

As per the report, one particular tailwind for Indian exports is the global effort to build greater resiliency in supply chains, post pandemic.

“This China + 1 strategy can help India gain market share, at the margin, but will also need India to further reduce logistical bottlenecks, and have better execution,” Barclays said.

On the services front, exports are likely to remain elevated given how competitive India's vast talent pool is against high global wage costs."

The highest repeat rate was also observed in BPC at 30%, followed by fashion at 28%. The electronics category saw one of the lowest repeat rates, at 14%.

“D2C brands are increasingly becoming shopper favourites. Shoppers are consistently finding value in shopping from these brands. As a result, the repeat order rate of the most shopped categories has also seen a significant increase. With exclusive deals, loyalty points and offers, deepening markets and evolving trust in these brands, we can expect further growth in this industry,"" said Chirag Taneja, co-founder and CEO of GoKwik.

He further added that 2023 marked another significant year for D2C brands and contributed to their growth. From obtaining funding to omnichannel expansion or becoming listed on the stock exchange, D2C brands have thrived. While shoppers continued to shop various products from the D2C brands, one significant product emerged as the winner, Vitamin C Serum.

With over 3.7 lakh orders, this product clocked the most orders on GoKwik’s network of D2C brands, cementing its position in the skincare routine of Indian shoppers. At 3.4 lakh orders, sunglasses came in the second spot as one of the shoppers’ favourites on the GoKwik network while skincare combos ranked third with 2.1 lakh orders.

Online premium memberships also seemed to be a favourite amongst D2C shoppers last year which could also be an indication of growing trust and loyalty for particular brands. Gift cards too had a huge demand from shoppers, possibly becoming a popular gifting option during the festive season.

“Shoppers buying directly from a D2C brand reflects growing trust in the products available on the brand website with no risk of counterfeits, etc especially when it comes to beauty and cosmetics,” Taneja added.

The top three products in terms of the highest orders in this category were Vitamin C Serum, closely followed by Night Cream and Hair Growth Serum.

Fashion stood tall clocking the second-highest number of orders. This could be indicative of the individuality in the space of fashion which is leading to an increase in the number of brands in subcategories that align with shopper needs. Healthcare products secured the third position in order volume, showcasing how rapidly Indian shoppers are becoming health-conscious and trusting D2C brands to cater to their needs. The top-selling products in this category were immunity kits and ayurvedic oil.

The highest-selling items in the electronics category, as seen on the GoKwik network, were wireless earphones followed by smartwatches. Furthermore, products related to hair-related concerns have spiked, especially in metro cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata) as hair serum and hair gummies were the most ordered products there.

GoKwik houses over 1200 eCommerce brands in its network including Lenskart, Neemans, Man Matters, Purplle, Shoppers Stop, etc, ranging from fashion, beauty, health and nutrition, electronics and other key categories of the online shopping space.

The panel ""acknowledged the concerns"" of the young wrestlers who have been hit hard by the year-long protests by top India grapplers.

Wrestling activities in the country have been hit hard following protests by the country's top three grapplers -- Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat -- against former WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

Neither the National camps nor the junior nationals have been held since January 2023.

Hundreds of junior wrestlers lost one full year due to the stalemate.

Bhupender Singh Bajwa, chairman of the three-member panel, assured the junior wrestlers that he would soon organise the sub junior and junior Nationals in Gwalior.

""The (ad-hoc) committee acknowledges the concerns raised by the young wrestlers (during the protest) and is committed to address the issues.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with the country's top police officers before addressing them at a formal session. Union Home Minister Amit Shah will be present throughout the conference that will span several sessions.

Implementation of the recently-enacted three criminal laws, the Maoist problem, inter-state police coordination and issues to be handled during the general elections are some of the other major issues expected to be discussed during the meeting, a Union Home Ministry official said.

About 250 officers in the rank of Directors General of Police (DGPs) and Inspectors General of Police (IGPs) will physically attend the conference while more than 200 others are likely to attend virtually.

Many officers have been tasked with delivering presentations on specific subjects such as counterterrorism, online fraud, cross-border terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, activities of pro-Khalistani groups and Left Wing Extremism, among others, the official said.

There will be detailed deliberations on how to face all these emerging internal security challenges.

Till 2013, the annual meet had been held in New Delhi.

The following year, after the Modi government came to power, it was decided to hold the event, organised by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs and the Intelligence Bureau, outside the national capital.

Accordingly, it was first held in Guwahati in 2014, Rann of Kutch in 2015, the National Police Academy in Hyderabad in 2016, the BSF Academy at Tekanpur in 2017, Pune in 2019.

In 2020, the meet was held virtually during the Covid pandemic and in hybrid mode in Lucknow in 2021. The conference was held in New Delhi in January 2023.

The number of business sessions and topics have increased significantly, with a focus on improving policing in the service of the people.

Before 2014, the deliberations largely focused on national security matters. Since 2014, these conferences have a twin focus on national security as well as core policing issues, including prevention and detection of crime, community policing, law and order and improving the police's image, among others, another official said.

Earlier, the conference was Delhi-centric with officers coming together only for the meet. Residing on the same premises over two to three days has served to build a heightened sense of unity among officers of all cadres and organisations since 2014, the official added.

Direct interaction of the police's top brass with the head of government has resulted in a convergence of views on crucial challenges faced by the country and the emergence of doable recommendations, the official further said.

In the past few years, the topics have been selected after detailed discussions with the highest echelons of the police service.

Once selected, several interactions on presentations are held before committees of DGPs to encourage participation and incorporate ideas from the field and from younger officers.

As a result, all presentations are now broad-based, content-intensive and carry a set of cogent, actionable recommendations.

Since 2015, detailed follow-up of recommendations of past conferences has become the norm and is the topic of the first business session, attended by the prime minister and the home minister, the official said.

Recommendations are tracked closely by the conference secretariat, led by the Intelligence Bureau, with the help of nodal officers in the states.

Decisions made in the past few conferences brought in significant policy changes, leading to improvement of policing, including setting higher standards for effective policing in rural and urban areas and improved methods of modern policing based on smart parameters, the official added.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/doctors-in-england-start-longest-strike-in-nhs-history/articleshow/106520430.cms,"Hospital doctors in England on Wednesday began their longest consecutive strike in the seven-decade history of Britain's National Service (NHS).

Junior doctors -- those below consultant level -- started a six-day walkout at 0700 GMT, in a major escalation of their long-running pay dispute with the UK government.

The industrial action, which ends next Tuesday, comes at one of the busiest times of the year for the state-funded NHS, when it faces increased pressure from winter respiratory illnesses.

It also quickly follows a three-day strike held by doctors just before Christmas, part of a wider series of stoppages across several sectors sparked by high inflation and a cost-of-living crisis.

Striking doctors say their wages have gone down by a quarter in real terms under the current government, which has been in power since 2010.

On a picket line outside St Thomas' Hospital, across the River Thames from the UK parliament in London, medics held up signs calling for better funding for the overstretched health service.

Others read ""£15/hour is not a fair wage for a junior doctor"" and ""Reduced pay keeps the doctor away"", with a map of Australia, which has previously advertised for UK-based staff to move.

""A lot of doctors are moving to Australia, not just because of the pay but also the work-life balance is better,"" said one doctor, Georgia Blackwell, 28.

""Other countries understand that doctors aren't being paid adequately and they're offering much better packages,"" added Shivani Ganesh, a 23-year-old medical student.
UK Health Secretary Victoria Atkins warned that the latest strikes will have a ""serious impact"" on patients across the country.

More than 1.2 million appointments have been rescheduled since the start of the strikes, including more than 88,000 last month, she added.

""I urge the BMA Junior Doctors Committee to call off their strikes and come back to the negotiating table so we can find a fair and reasonable solution to end the strikes once and for all,"" Atkins said.

Junior doctors have gone on strike seven times since March.

The British Medical Association (BMA) announced the walkout in December after a breakdown in talks with the government.

The union said junior doctors have been offered a 3.0-percent rise on top of the average 8.8-percent increase they were given earlier this year.

It rejected the offer because the cash would be split unevenly across different doctor grades and would ""still amount to pay cuts for many doctors"" after inflation.

The co-chair of the BMA Junior Doctors Committee, Robert Laurenson, accused the government of failing to broker new talks.

""Strike action is the only thing this government will sit down and listen to,"" he told AFP, warning of more strikes to come without a ""credible"" pay offer.

The NHS itself said the latest stoppage, which could see up to half of the medical workforce on picket lines, would have ""a significant impact on almost all routine care"".

""This January could be one of the most difficult starts to the year the NHS has ever faced,"" said its national medical director, Stephen Powis.

The NHS typically sees a rise in the number of people in hospital in the two weeks after Christmas, due to people delaying seeking treatment in order to spend the festive season with loved ones.

The service is already facing huge backlogs in waiting times for appointments and surgery, blamed on treatment postponement during Covid but also years of under-funding.

Julian Hartley, the chief executive of NHS Providers which represents hospital groups in England, said the effect of the strikes on patients would be ""significant"".

""The vast majority of planned operations, appointments, and so on, will have to be stood down,"" he told BBC television.

Consultants will cover for junior doctors and emergency and urgent care such as maternity and intensive care services will be operating.

But there are fears that Covid, flu and other seasonal conditions could also hit staffing.

""We're deeply concerned about the kind of impact over the coming days,"" said Hartley.

on the opening day of the second and final Test on Wednesday in Cape Town. Pacer Mohammed Siraj delivered a remarkable performance, taking six wickets, as India dismissed South Africa at the lowest total for any team against India in tests.

Siraj exhibited exceptional bowling, conceding only 15 runs in nine overs and compelling the South African batsmen to succumb on a pitch favoring pace bowlers. The decision by Captain Dean Elgar to bat first, following his toss-winning farewell Test, ended up being a nightmare for the home side.

Jasprit Bumrah secured two South African scalps, while debutant Mukesh Kumar got two wickets. Only two batsmen managed to reach the double digits. Kyle Verreynne was the top scorer for South Africa with 15 runs. The other double-digit getter was David Bedingham, with 12 runs.

Earlier, South Africa's captain, Dean Elgar, won the toss and chose to bat first in the crucial second and final Test against India at Newlands on Wednesday. The hosts already hold an insurmountable 1-0 lead in the series following a convincing victory in the initial match. This is the final test for Elgar, who announced his retirement before the series.

India suffered a crushing defeat in the opening Test in Centurion, where they lost by an innings and 32 runs on Day 3.

Ravindra Jadeja found a place in India's Playing XI, replacing off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin. Mukesh Kumar also entered the lineup in lieu of Shardul Thakur. On the South African side, Tristan Stubbs earned his debut cap, taking the place of Temba Bavuma, while Lungi Ngidi and Keshav Maharaj were included in the Playing XI.

Speaking at the toss, Elgar mentioned, ""Going to bat. The pitch looks interesting. We're in a great position. Can't win a two-match series if you don't win the first - we've crossed that hurdle."" Rohit Sharma, the Indian skipper, expressed, ""Would've batted first as well. Looks like a good pitch. We understand the challenge of batting first on that pitch."" Both teams made strategic changes to their Playing XI, with Elgar emphasizing the importance of starting well against the Indian side.

South Africa's Playing XI includes Dean Elgar(c), Aiden Markram, Tony de Zorzi, Tristan Stubbs, David Bedingham, Kyle Verreynne(w), Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Nandre Burger, and Lungi Ngidi. India's Playing XI comprises Rohit Sharma(c), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul(w), Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, and Mukesh Kumar.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/wfi-without-sanjay-singh-is-acceptable-to-us-sakshi-malik/articleshow/106511732.cms,"Sakshi Malik on Wednesday insisted that she has no issues with the newly-elected Wrestling Federation of India if Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh-loyalist Sanjay Singh is kept away from the body. Malik had announced her retirement from the sport on December 21 in protest against the election of Sanjay Singh as WFI President.

The 2016 Rio Olympic Games bronze medallist also claimed that her mother has been receiving threat calls from former WFI chief Brij Bhushan's supporters.

Malik, 31, said they will accept a WFI without Sanjay Singh but ruled out her own involvement in running of the federation.

""We don't have any issues with the new federation except one man, Sanjay Singh. We don't have any issue if the new body comes back without Sanjay Singh. We do not have any issue with the ad-hoc committee as well,"" Malik told reporters.

""The government is like parents for us and I would request them to make wrestling safe for the upcoming wrestlers. You have seen how Sanjay Singh has been behaving. I don't want Sanjay Singh's interference in the federation,"" she added.

""I can only make a request. If the ministry says he won't come back it will be better. Everybody saw the kind of power abuse by Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh after the WFI elections. He announced junior nationals at his home without much deliberation.""

Sanjay Singh had defeated 2010 CWG gold medallist Anita Sheoran by a huge 40-7 margin.

Prem Chand Lochab, who was from the Sheoran panel and had the backing of Malik, Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat, was elected secretary general.

Sakshi also requested the ad-hoc panel to conduct age group nationals at the earliest.

""I don't want that any young wrestler suffers because of us. The ad-hoc committee has already announced senior nationals and I request the ad-hoc committee to announce the U15, U17 and U20 nationals.""

Interestingly, hundreds of junior wrestlers on Wednesday assembled at Jantar Mantar to protest against Malik, Phogat and Punia, who they blamed for the mess in Indian wrestling.

Malik then revealed that her family is getting threats.

""For past two-three days, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh's goons have become active. My mother is getting threats through phone calls. People are calling and saying that a case will be registered against someone in my family.

""People on social media are abusing us but they should remember that they have sisters and daughters at their home.""

Asked if she would consider becoming a sports administrator, Malik replied in a negative.

""I am disturbed. We just want that junior wrestlers to not suffer. As of now I don't have it in my mind.

""We are being blamed for junior wrestlers' loss and that's incorrect. If women are involved in running of sport, that will be good,"" she said.

When informed about junior wrestlers' protest against them at Jantar Mantar, Malik said, ""I have given 18-20 years to wrestling. Only I know what I have gone through in the last few months.""

Chouhan's government accommodation is located off Link Road No. 1 in the posh 74 Bungalows locality in the state capital where he moved after vacating the Chief Minister's house on relinquishing the top post last month. The four-term former CM, who was at the helm in Madhya Pradesh for more than 16 years, is popularly known as ""mama"" (maternal uncle).

On Wednesday, Chouhan (64) shared photos of the naming of his bungalow as ""Mama Ka Ghar"", nearly a month after he resigned as Chief Minister following the BJP's decision to select three-term MLA Mohan Yadav as his successor on winning the November 17 assembly polls.

Sharing the pictures on his official X account, the BJP stalwart, who is the MLA from Budhni in Sehore district, said his relationship with his ""sisters, brothers, nephews and nieces"" was one of love, trust and affection. ""The address has changed, but 'Mama Ka Ghar' is still mama's house. I will remain connected to you like a brother and maternal uncle. The doors of my house will always be open for you,"" he said.

Chouhan further added, ""Whenever you miss me or need me, feel free to come home, after all this is your maternal uncle and brother's house."" The house in the upscale 74 Bungalows locality was one of the two government accommodations Chouhan was possessing for the past several years.

As chief minister, Chouhan resided in CM's house located on a hillock named Shyamla Hills, adjoining Bhopal's Upper Lake. When the BJP lost assembly elections in 2018, Chouhan vacated the CM's residence and shifted to his second bungalow. After getting the top post in March 2020 when the BJP came back to power, he again moved to the CM's residence.

Loaded in buses, the junior wrestlers arrived from different parts of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi, catching the police unawares.

Close to 300 of them came from Arya Samaj Akhara in Chhaprauli, Baghpat while many others came from the Virender Wrestling Academy in Narela. The security personnel struggled to control them as they shouted slogans against Punia, Malik and Phogat.

Braving cold conditions, the junior wrestlers arrived at Jantar Mantar at 11am and left after three hours with a warning that if the government does not lift the WFI suspension within 10 days, they will start returning their awards.

The protesters were carrying banners that read: 'UWW (United World Wrestling) save our wrestling from these 3 wrestlers'.

Another banner read: 'Kar Diya Desh Ki Kushti Ko Barbaad: Sakshi Bajrang, Vinesh Phogat'.

Soon after the election of new office-bearers, the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) announced the hosting of the Under-15 and Under-20 Nationals in Gonda, UP but the ministry suspended the body, leading to the cancellation of the proposed tournament.

Several wrestlers, who could have competed in the junior categories for one last time, lost the opportunity.

""It was a symbolic protest. We are giving 10 days' time to the government to revoke the suspension of the new WFI and allow it to hold age group nationals.

""If they don't do it, we will start returning our Arjuna and other awards to the government just like Bajrang and Vinesh have done,"" said Greco-Roman wrestler Sunil Rana, who is an Arjuna awardee and a bronze medallist from the 2023 Asian Games.

Muzaffarnagar stadium coach Pradeep Kumar said, ""More than 90 per cent of Akharas (training centres) in UP are with us in this protest. There are only three wrestlers on one side and lakhs on the other. They have spoilt the careers of lakhs of wrestlers across the country.""

""These people have no respect for national awards. They are leaving them on the roads,"" Kumar added, referring to Punia and Phogat returning their government honours.

""They kept saying that they were protesting for women and junior wrestlers but they have spoilt careers of lakhs after earning all the laurels. Their protest is only to get top WFI posts. Once that happens, they will stop all protests,"" added Kumar.

Ironically, almost a year back at the same protest site, the top three wrestlers had managed to draw huge support for their cause when they called for the arrest of former WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, accusing him of sexually harassing women wrestlers.

Thousands of people from different sections of society, including farmers' groups, social workers, politicians, women's groups and members of the wrestling fraternity, came out to support Sakshi, Vinesh and Bajrang.

The three are now facing protests from within their community, with those assembled at Jantar Mantar accusing them of ruining their careers.

""I have given 18-20 years to the sport. Only I know what I have gone through.A lot of wrong things are being said on social media. I have come to know about this protest from you (media). This is Brij Bhushan's propaganda. These are all his men who are protesting at jantar mantar,"" said Sakshi when her reaction was sought on junior wrestlers' protest.

Meanwhile, Bajrang said he ""won't lend any credence"" to the Wednesday's protest by commenting on it.

Source close to Tokyo Games bronze medallist Bajrang said, ""These are all Brij Bhushan's supporters. Where were they when we were sitting on protest. They did not think about wrestling then?.""

Since January 2023, national camps and competitions have been on hold as the WFI has been suspended twice and an ad-hoc panel is running the sport.

""An entire year for these junior wrestlers has gone waste. The new WFI had taken the decision for the welfare of the wrestlers who had not seen even district or state-level competitions, leave aside the nationals,"" said Vivek Malik who belongs to the Arya Samaj Akhara in Baghpat.

""But the new body was suspended. This body was elected on the instructions of the court but it wasn't allowed to work and prove itself even for three days. The suspension should be lifted and the WFI should be allowed to function.

""They had the task of completing the wrestling calender before December 31, so what wrong did they do to warrant the suspension?"" he asked.

Those protesting on Wednesday demanded that the suspended WFI be restored after disbanding the ad-hoc panel, which has been appointed by the sports ministry.

The protesters also defaced the placards bearing images of Punia, Malik and Phogat before trampling them.

In a memorandum, Sunil Rana, coach Naresh Dahiya, wrestlers Nikki and Varun Gujjar apart from Rajendra 'pehlwan', demanded that ""the government should listen to not just the three wresters but the entire fraternity.

""We request that the government lifts WFI suspension and take strict action against the wrestlers who insulted the government honours by leaving their awards on the road.""

Punia had returned his Padma Shri while Vinesh had returned her Arjuna and Khel Ratna awards, saying that these awards mean nothing when they are struggling to get justice.

The ad-hoc panel announced that it will organise U15 and U20 Nationals within six weeks in Gwalior and advised the protesting wrestlers to continue training and practising for Nationals.

This phenomenon, identified as Nacreous or Mother of Pearl clouds, occurred near Nairn Beach on Christmas Eve, casting a vibrant spectacle shortly after sunrise around 9 am.

A 29 year old photographer Joshua Earle captured this extraordinary event and shared a video on his Instagram account.


Earle in the caption expressed his awe, stating, ""These incredible clouds have been appearing across the UK this week. This video was taken near Nairn Beach at around 9:00 am this morning. I still can't wrap my head around what I'm seeing! Nature is simply amazing.""

He explained that the phenomenon also known as Polar Stratospheric Clouds occurs due to high arctic clouds containing tiny ice crystals that refract sunlight.

""It's worth keeping an eye out at sunrise and sunset this weekend if you're in the UK. You might just spot a rainbow cloud!""

Earle added, encouraging others to witness this rare celestial spectacle.

The photographer noted that the vibrant clouds adorned the horizon, creating shimmering rainbows within the clouds. Although it was his first encounter with these clouds, they had appeared three or four times in the week leading up to Christmas Eve.

The Instagram video gained immense popularity, reaching over 3.8 million views and 272,000 likes. Users shared their fascination, offering scientific explanations and personal stories.

""The Karnataka government should be alert because in Gujarat during the same occasion, the Kar Sevaks were set on fire at Godhra,"" the MLC told reporters here.

The 2002 Godhra train burning case had plunged Gujarat into one of the worst communal riots.

The former Rajya Sabha member said: ""A similar (Godhra-like) situation can be created here also. So, no room should be given for any untoward incident to happen in Karnataka. All the arrangements should be made for those willing to go to Ayodhya so that we should not see another Godhra happening in Karnataka.""

""There is absolute possibility (for such incident). I can even give information. I can tell you that the head of some organisations went to some states and have instigated some BJP leaders. I cannot say that openly. They are doing it. They are instigating such act"", Hariprasad alleged.

On the invitation to Congress leaders for the consecration ceremony of Ram temple in Ayodhya, Hariprasad said this event should be seen politically and not religiously.

""If a Hindu Dharma Guru inaugurates the Rama temple then you and me would have gone there (to Ayodhya) without any invitation"", he said.

""My knowledge tells me that the four Shankaracharyas are the head of the Hindu religion. If the four Shankaracharyas or any religious head had inaugurated the event then I would have attended the event. (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi and (Home Minister) Amit Shah are not 'Dharma Guru' but political leaders. We have to take this into consideration,"" he said.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/uk/harvard-president-claudine-gays-abrupt-exit-sparks-questions/articleshow/106519134.cms,"In a surprising turn of events, Harvard President Claudine Gay announced her resignation on Tuesday, merely six months into her tenure. The decision comes amid allegations of plagiarism in her academic work and scrutiny from congressional lawmakers over her handling of antisemitism on campus during the Israel-Hamas conflict.

Claudine Gay, Harvard's first Black president, expressed the difficulty of her decision in a statement, noting, ""This is not a decision I came to easily."" After consulting with the Harvard Corporation, she concluded that resigning is in the best interests of the institution.

Challenges and Controversy
Facing criticism for not properly citing passages in her academic papers, Gay found herself under intense scrutiny. The Harvard Corporation, acknowledging her missteps, highlighted her resilience against personal attacks, including ""repugnant and racist vitriol.""

The resignation has sparked reactions from various quarters, with New York Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik deeming it ""long overdue."" Stefanik's questioning of Gay during a congressional hearing became viral, and she emphasized the need for accountability within Harvard's leadership.

Ron Halber, the Executive Director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington, stated that Gay should have resigned immediately after her congressional testimony. He criticized the Harvard Corporation's response, seeing it as a missed opportunity to condemn antisemitism.

Halber emphasized the need for consistent standards, stating, ""We wouldn't accept it for any other group. Why should the Jewish community demand any less?""

Board's initial support and later developments
Initially, Harvard's board expressed unanimous support for Gay's leadership despite the congressional outrage. However, following further investigations prompted by anonymous complaints, Harvard acknowledged instances of inadequate citation in Gay's work.

While no evidence of intentional deception was found, Gay submitted requests for corrections, and the board granted her request to add citations in her dissertation.

The controversy gained momentum after a congressional hearing where Gay and other university presidents faced questions about antisemitism on campuses. Elise Stefanik's pointed questions went viral, leading to bipartisan calls for Gay's resignation.

In response, a review of Harvard's handling of plagiarism accusations was initiated, threatening federal funding if standards were not consistently applied.

Civil Rights leaders and alumni responses
Various groups and leaders, including the National Conference of Black Political Scientists and Rev. Al Sharpton, expressed disappointment over Gay's resignation. They highlighted racial implications and defended Gay against what they perceived as unfair attacks.

FAQs
Q1: Who will serve as interim president?
A1: Alan M. Garber, the university's provost and chief academic officer, will serve as interim president.

Q2: What was Elise Stefanik's reaction to the resignation?
A2: Elise Stefanik called Gay's resignation 'long overdue' and hinted at possible resignations from the Harvard Corporation Board.

The Supreme Court today directed the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to complete its probe into the remaining two cases of alleged violations by the Adani companies within three months. However, it decided not to order a probe by a special investigation team or the Central Bureau of Investigation. The court also upheld the validity of the Sebi regulations, which were allegedly used by the Adani group to inflate its stock prices.

How billions poured in to keep Adani companies afloat

Adani is still on the hook but the entrepreneur has over the last one year refused to buckle under the Hindenburg allegations. Within a month of the publication of the Hindenburg report, he tumbled from the 3rd position among the richest in the world to 25th as his company stocks melted down and his wealth plunged from $120 billion to $50 billion.

For once, the Indian conglomerate, which had come to be a vital player in the country's infrastructure sector, seemed heading to perdition. The Hindenburg allegations and relentless badgering from various opposition parties had rendered Adani an untouchable in the world of finance. His group was seen as a sinking ship no one would like to bolster. However, a canny Adani quickly got to the heart of the matter: the reputational loss that will keep global investors away.

Within two months, a maverick American investment management company, GQG Partners, surprised everyone by announcing it would invest S$1.9 billion into four of the Adani Group's publicly listed companies. That was a crucial vote of confidence for Adani which started turning the tide in his favour.

Between March and August, GQG Partners bought stakes worth almost $4.3 billion in five Adani group companies while Qatar Investment Authority and French energy giant TotalEnergies poured in $770 million in renewable energy firm Adani Green Energy Ltd. The backing by these global giants helped Adani shore up his reputation. He himself infused $4.6 billion in repaying loans against shares, servicing loans taken for cement acquisitions and supporting green investments.

While the equity raise helped recoup investor confidence, the group re-established its bankability with $6.4 billion of loans raised across five companies and refinancing of $3.5 billion debt taken to fund the 2022 acquisition of ACC and Ambuja Cement.

The billions of dollars pouring into Adani businesses gave the impression that Adani was too strong to be felled by a damning report by a short-seller. As if all was well, Adani went ahead with ambitious M&A deals, acquiring Sanghi cement for $431 million, 49.38 per cent in Indian Oil Tanking for $128 million, Karaikal port for $181 million and Coastal Energen for $420 million.

These together with scrapping of a $850 million coal plant purchase, reining in of expenses, and repayment of some debt were part of attempt to claw back the narrative by showcasing that equity can be raised not just from promoters but also global investors and that the group was a responsible borrower with prepayments and on-time payments of debt. In total, the Adani Group raised over $5 billion in equity and a double of that in debt in the past year, PTI has reported. The M&As assured investors that Adani was unnerved by the potential of the Hindenburg allegations to damage his business.

In November last year, America's International Development Finance Corp announced funding of $553 million for Adani's port project in Sri Lanka. An American government agency investing in his companies capped Adani's year-long efforts to get a vote of trust from global investors. Around 80% of the group's long-duration capital comes from the global capital market, while remaining 20% of shorter-duration capital comes from domestic market

Business as usual

Clearly, Adani did not wait to see the course of the Hindenburg affair but went ahead with business as usual. Now, he is also unveiling his ambitious future plans to expand his business, especially globally. A month ago, Chief Financial Officer Jugeshinder Singh said the group had planned to spend $84 billion over the next decade on infrastructure projects.

When asked if the company's cost of funds has risen since the Hindenburg allegations, Singh said that the weighted average cost of capital for core infra business has always remained between 9.25-9.50%.

Adani Ports and SEZ , Adani Green Energy, Adani Power and within Adani Enterprises, airports and roads may tap the domestic bond market in near future. Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission may tap the overseas bond market and issue Regulation-S and Regulation-D bonds in 2024. Adani Green Energy will need to raise $350 million of notes to refinance existing debt that will mature in December 2024, Singh said.

He also said that the distrust in the minds of people towards the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) was gradually growing.

""I do not need anyone's invitation to have darshan of Lord Ram. Lord Ram is in our hearts,"" Singh said in response to reporters' query whether he has received an invitation for the idol consecration ceremony being organised on January 22. The Rajya Sabha MP alleged that the Election Commission has failed to give time to the opposition India bloc since the last six months for a meeting to discuss the issue of EVMs.

""The distrust in the minds of people towards EVMs is gradually growing due to the Election Commission's attitude on the questions being raised regarding the software and chip technology of these machines,"" he claimed. Singh also said that a large number of opposition MPs were suspended from Parliament for the ""fault"" of seeking Home Minister Amit Shah's statement in the House on the Parliament security breach incident.

""We were suspended from Parliament and important bills were passed without a discussion,"" he said. The Congress leader said that if the Election Commission and the Union government continue to have this attitude, then common people will gradually lose faith in democracy.

""What will happen if we lose faith in democracy? No one can stop the path of revolution,"" he said. Singh said Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders ask that if there is a glitch in the EVMs, then how did the Congress win the last assembly elections in Karnataka and Telangana.

Answering this question himself, he said, ""If someone who steals secretly takes away all the goods, he will be caught. That's why he steals slowly. This theft started after the 2012 Gujarat assembly elections."" Taking a dig at the BJP's ""Abki baar 400 paar"" (winning 400-plus seats this time) slogan for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls, Singh said, ""In the next elections, BJP will give the slogan of winning all 542 Lok Sabha seats.""

He accused the BJP of misusing the administrative machinery in Madhya Pradesh, adding fake names in the voters' list and indulging in bogus voting. Singh claimed that the BJP was losing the assembly elections held in the state in November last year and all the election surveys were in favour of the Congress. ""...But the election results came out just the opposite,"" Singh said while expressing doubts over the efficiency of EVMs.

""Every countryman is today happy to see the progress of Uttar Pradesh and the world is surprised because before 2017, there was an atmosphere of disappointment, frustration and anarchy here,"" Adityanath said at a programme here.

The BJP came to power in 2017 after removing Akhilesh Yadav led Samajwadi Party government.

""We have entered the year 2024. In these seven and a quarter years, the state has risen from the sixth-seventh economy to become the state having the second largest economy in the country. The state is moving towards becoming the largest economy in the country with the highest growth rate and economic development rate,"" he added.

Adityanath, who was speaking at the mega loan distribution ceremony of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) organised here, said that One District One Products (ODOPs) from all the 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh should be graded and postage stamps should be released on them to get the products global recognition.

Emphasising the importance of teamwork, he said that when people work collectively, the desired results are achieved.

""We have entered the year 2024. In these past seven years, the state has jumped from its position of sixth-seventh economy to become the second-largest economy in the country today"", he remarked.

Stressing that law and order has improved in the state, the chief minister said every person, sister-daughter, businessman and investor of the state is now feeling safe.

""This is the reason why Uttar Pradesh has emerged as the best investment destination in the country,"" he pointed out.

Adityanath said that the state has received investment proposals of Rs 40 lakh crores in GIS-23, which will directly contribute in generating employment for more than 1 crore 10 lakh youth.

Uttar Pradesh is the first state to actively support the 'Vocal for Local' campaign initiated by the central government, he pointed out.

Adityanath said that the MSME has given a new identity to Uttar Pradesh and added the government's One District One Product (ODOP) scheme has given a new direction to the traditional entrepreneurs, who were earlier frustrated and forced to flee because they were not heard.

""Today, One District One Product has given an identity to the state and has given a new direction to the entrepreneurs associated with the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. This has brought a smile on their faces,"" he said.

The chief minister said this has also developed Uttar Pradesh as an export state due to which our exports have increased almost thrice.

Adityanath said that the ODOP products should not be confined to coffee table books, adding that postage stamps should be released for the product of each district.

""Efforts should be made for this because it will provide us global recognition. Every district's product should also be graded so that information about good products can be conveyed. Combining it with packaging and technology will get the products global recognition"", he asserted.

Adityanath further said Uttar Pradesh is the first state to provide the ODOP, Vishwakarma Shram Samman Yojana and PLEDGE Scheme while pointing out that the schemes have led to significant growth in the MSME units in the state as it boasts of having 96 lakh MSME units today.

The chief minister also asked the bankers to give ample loans to those with small capital because small capital does not sink.

""While this will increase their business, it will also increase the confidence of the bankers among those with small capital. With this the state will move towards prosperity,"" he said.

Adityanath stressed that ""we should not be limited to releasing coffee table books but postage stamps of the production of every district should also be issued"".

""Efforts should be made in this regard because it will give us global recognition. Not only this, there should also be grading of the produce of every district so that information about good production can be given,"" he added.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/the-rise-of-universal-studios-how-they-beat-disney-as-the-top-earning-studio-of-2023/articleshow/106517989.cms,"Universal Pictures has pulled off a surprising feat by overtaking Disney as the highest-grossing studio at the 2023 box office. This is the first time since 2015 that Universal has achieved this milestone.

The success can be attributed to a diverse lineup of 24 films, including popular blockbusters such as ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"" ""Oppenheimer,"" and ""M3GAN."" These movies collectively raked in an incredible $4.907 billion in ticket sales worldwide. On the other hand, Disney, which has been a dominant force in the global box office, had to settle for second place with earnings of $4.827 billion from 17 new releases.


The studio acknowledged that their decision to release seven fewer films in 2023 played a role in the $80 million difference between Universal and Disney's earnings. This unexpected turn of events has created a buzz in the film industry, with many industry insiders closely watching Universal's ascent and Disney's descent in the box office rankings. It remains to be seen how this will impact future strategies and releases for both studios.

In the words of a Universal Pictures spokesperson, ""We are thrilled to have emerged as the highest-grossing studio of 2023. Our diverse lineup of films resonated with audiences worldwide, and we are grateful for their support. This achievement is a testament to the hard work and talent of our filmmakers, cast, and crew.""

As for Disney, they are not taking this setback lightly. A representative from the studio stated, ""While we congratulate Universal on their success, we remain committed to delivering high-quality entertainment to our global audience. Our focus has always been on providing memorable and impactful storytelling, and we will continue to do so in the years to come.""

This shift in the box office hierarchy serves as a reminder that the film industry is ever-evolving, with studios constantly vying for the top spot. It also highlights the importance of a strong and diverse film slate, as well as strategic release planning. With Universal's newfound success and Disney's determination to reclaim the top spot, moviegoers can expect fierce competition and exciting offerings in the coming years. Disney highlighted its notable presence in the top 10 studios despite this setback.

Prominent changes in the movie rankings
Disney's Reign at the Box Office Comes to an End In a surprising turn of events, Disney, known for its box office dominance, failed to secure a spot among the top three highest-grossing films of the year for the first time in many years. This year, it was Warner Bros. who took two of these coveted positions with their films ""Barbie"" and ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"" earning a staggering $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion respectively. Universal's ""Oppenheimer"" also made it to the top three with an impressive $950 million.

What makes this even more noteworthy is that 2023 marked the first year without a Disney film surpassing the $1 billion mark, excluding the pandemic-hit years of 2020 and 2021. This unexpected turn of events has raised eyebrows and sparked discussions about Disney's recent difficulties and Universal's rising fortitude.

While Disney is still widely regarded as a powerhouse in the film industry, it is evident that some of its highly anticipated movies in 2023 failed to live up to the immense hype surrounding them. With the exception of the successful ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,"" a series of poorly received remakes and sequels forced Disney to relinquish its usual top spot at the box office to Universal. Disney's stumble this year serves as a reminder that even the biggest players in the industry can face challenges. As the landscape of cinema continues to evolve, it will be intriguing to see how Disney navigates these obstacles and regains its position as a box office powerhouse in the future.

Exorbitant expenses affecting Disney's output
Disney faces numerous obstacles, one of which is the high production expenses of its films, which usually range from $200 million to $250 million. Even with $476 million in revenue, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" was the 10th highest-grossing film of the year, but the studio did not make money on its theatrical release.

Studio placements outside of the top two
With $3.84 billion, Warner Bros. placed a distant third place globally, driven by hits including ""Barbie,"" ""The Nun II,"" and ""Wonka."" The other two studios in the top five, Sony and Paramount, each reportedly made $2 billion in global box office revenue. However, Sony's projected $2.09 billion gave it a small advantage.

Prospects for the future of Studios
Sony is well-positioned to sustain its impressive performance in 2023 with highly anticipated films like ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"" Denzel Washington's ""Equalizer 3,"" and Ridley Scott's ""Napoleon"". Counting on blockbuster hits like ""Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,"" ""Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,"" and ""PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie,"" Paramount ended the year with an estimated $2.03 billion worldwide.

FAQs:
Q1: Why did Disney slide to the second position in 2023?
A1: Disney released seven fewer movies compared to Universal, contributing to the $80 million difference in global box office revenue.

Q2: What were the top three highest-grossing movies of 2023?
A2: Warner Bros.' ""Barbie"" ($1.4 billion), Universal's ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" ($1.3 billion), and ""Oppenheimer"" ($950 million) secured the top spots.

Q3: What impacted Disney's overall box office performance?
A3: Disney faced challenges with high production costs, leading to financial setbacks even for movies with substantial gross revenue, such as ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.

In its report titled 'APAC Cross-Sector Outlook 2024', Fitch said the outlooks for the banking sectors in India and Indonesia, as well as APAC emerging markets as a whole, move to improving in 2024, partly reflecting the robust economic backdrop.

""Economic growth in APAC will generally remain strong in 2024, especially in emerging markets (EMs), supporting sector outlooks across the region. We expect real GDP to expand by, or above, 5 per cent in India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam, and China's performance will still be strong by most other countries' standards,"" Fitch said.

The Indian economy grew 7.2 per cent in 2022-23 fiscal year. India's GDP expanded 7.8 per cent and 7.6 per cent in the June and September quarters, respectively.

Fitch had last month said it expects India to be among the world's fastest-growing large sovereigns, with resilient GDP growth of 6.9 per cent this fiscal, followed by 6.5 per cent in 2024-25.

""Robust regional economic growth - particularly in Asia's large emerging markets - should offset headwinds from slowing growth in China, weak global demand and high interest rates, helping to support performance across sectors in APAC in 2024,"" Fitch Ratings Senior Director Duncan Innes-Ker said.

Fitch said headwinds from slower Chinese growth, weak global demand and higher interest burdens following the rise in interest rates over 2022-23 will weigh on performance for many sectors. But the bulk of Fitch's APAC sector outlooks for 2024 remain neutral.

""Sino-US tensions have eased recently, but we expect relations to remain challenging, which will lead companies to pursue further supply-chain diversification to limit exposure to geopolitical risks,"" Fitch said.

According to the lawyer, the ASI requested the court for four more weeks before the sealed survey report is opened.

The ASI submitted its survey report to the district court in a sealed cover on December 18.

The survey was ordered by the court after the petitioners claimed the 17th-century mosque was constructed over a pre-existing temple.

The ASI carried out the scientific survey of the Gyanvapi premises, located next to the Kashi Vishwanath temple, to determine whether the mosque was constructed over a pre-existing structure of a Hindu temple.

The survey was carried out on the direction of the district court. In its July 21 order, the court mentioned the need to survey beneath the mosque's domes, the cellars and the western wall.

It said the ASI should also examine the plinth and pillars to determine the age and nature of the building. The court had asked the ASI to ensure that there was no damage to the structure standing on the disputed land.

The last leg of sowing of wheat, the main rabi (winter) crop, is underway and will continue till next week. Till last week, wheat was planted in 320.54 lakh hectares, as per the official data.

Wheat production stood at a record 110.55 million tonnes in the 2022-23 crop year (July-June), compared to 107.7 million tonnes achieved in the previous year.

""We expect that total area under cultivation of wheat will increase this year and God willingly if the climate is alright the production will be 114 million tonne that's what the agriculture ministry has indicated informally to us,"" Food Corporation of India (FCI) Chairman and Managing Director Ashok K Meena told reporters.

Area sown to wheat crop is also showing an increase compared to the last year. There was a deficit of one per cent in some states but that will also be made up in the first week of January, he said.

""If that is the level of production, we are very confident that we will be able to procure more than our requirement and also additional stocks needed for the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS) for next year,"" he noted.

When asked if the central nodal agency plans to step up procurement considering the opening wheat balance of 76 lakh tonnes to be on April 1, which is just enough to meet the buffer requirement, the FCI chief said: ""We will try our best to provide minimum support price to all farmers. Because of the open market sale, the indications are prices have stabilised and are not higher than it was last year.

""Since the wheat MSP is higher by 7 per cent than the last year, we hope that lot of farmers will be willing to give their produce to the FCI,"" Meena said.

Last year, the FCI's wheat procurement stood at 26.2 million tonnes, higher than the annual buffer requirement of 18.4 million tonnes.

This year's wheat crop will be ready for harvest from April onwards.

FCI is the central nodal agency that buys rice and wheat to ensure MSP to the farmers and distributes the same for free to 81 crore poor via ration shops. It also uses surplus grain via OMSS to boost domestic availability and check prices.

A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta refused to pass any order on an interim prayer of Moitra to let her attend the proceedings of the House, saying, allowing it would be like allowing the main petition.

""We will consider your plea for interim relief in March,"" Justice Khanna told Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for Moitra.

The top court also refused to issue any notice to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and the Committee on Ethics of Lok Sabha -- both were made a party by Moitra in her plea -- and said it would only seek a reply from the Lok Sabha secretary general.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Lok Sabha secretary general, requested the court not to issue a formal notice and said that he would file a reply to Moitra's petition.

Mehta said the court should not venture into the internal matter of discipline in the sovereign organ of the state. The bench then passed the order and listed the matter for further hearing in the week starting March 11.

On December 8, after a heated debate in the Lok Sabha over the panel report, during which Moitra was not allowed to speak, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi moved a motion to expel the TMC MP from the House for ""unethical conduct,"" which was adopted by a voice vote.

The ethics committee found Moitra guilty of ""unethical conduct"" and contempt of the House as she shared her Lok Sabha members' portal credentials -- user ID and password -- with unauthorised people, which had an irrepressible impact on national security, Joshi had said.

The committee had also recommended that in view of the ""highly objectionable, unethical, heinous and criminal conduct"" of Moitra, an intense legal and institutional inquiry be initiated by the government with a set deadline.

The motion moved by Joshi said Moitra's ""conduct has further been found to be unbecoming as an MP for accepting gifts and illegal gratification from a businessman to further his interest, which is a serious misdemeanour and highly deplorable conduct"" on her part.

Earlier, ethics committee Chairman Vinod Kumar Sonkar had tabled the first report of the panel on a complaint filed by Bharatiya Janata Party MP Nishikant Dubey against Moitra.

In October last year, Dubey, on the basis of a complaint submitted by Supreme Court lawyer Jai Anant Dehadrai, alleged that Moitra had asked questions in the Lok Sabha in exchange for cash and gifts from businessman Darshan Hiranandani to mount an attack on industrialist Gautam Adani and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

In an affidavit to the ethics committee on October 19, last year, Hiranandani claimed that Moitra had provided him with her login ID and password for the Lok Sabha members' website.

Officials have confirmed that Aasha has delivered three cubs, bringing renewed hope for the resurgence of cheetahs in India.

This momentous event is seen as a beacon of hope for the restoration of the cheetah population in the country, according to officials.

Authorities are closely monitoring Aasha and her newborn cubs, ensuring a safe and nurturing environment for their growth and development.

Union Minister Bhupendra shared the news of the arrival of the new cubs on social media, saying, ""Purrs in the wild! Thrilled to share that Kuno National Park has welcomed three new members.

Serum Institute of India came second with Rs 50.25 crore followed by ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India’s Rs 50 crore.

Top 10 corporates donated Rs 332.26 crore to electoral trusts, which made up 90.66% of total donations received by trusts during 2022-23, according to a report by the nonprofit Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR). All the 10 donors gave funds to the Prudent Electoral Trust.

Thirty-nine corporates and business houses contributed Rs 363.71 crore to electoral trusts in 2022-23. While 34 of them contributed Rs 360.46 crore to Prudent Electoral Trust, the rest gave to Samaj Electoral Trust (Rs 2 cr), Paribartan Electoral Trust (Rs 75.50 lakh) and Triumph Electoral Trust (Rs 50 lakh). Eleven individuals also gave money to trusts.

Prudent donated Rs 256.25 crore to the BJP in 2022-23 as against Rs 336.50 crore it gave in 2021-22, while Samaj donated Rs 1.50 crore to the BJP in 2022-23. The Congress received Rs 50 lakh from Samaj. Prudent donated to four political parties, including the major ones like the BJP, BRS, YSR Congress and AAP.

The BJP received Rs 259 crore or 70.69% of the total donations received by all political parties from electoral trusts. The BRS got Rs 90 crore or a fourth of the total donations received by all parties from all five electoral trusts. Other three political parties including YSR Congress, AAP and the Congress together got Rs 17.40 crore.



EIGHT GOT NIL DONATION:
Eight of the 13 Electoral Trusts said that they did not receive any contribution in 2022-23. Two trusts said they did not get any donations between 2013-14 and 2022-23 while two others said they have not got any donation since their registration. Four trusts said they got contributions only once.

The contribution reports for 2022-23 of five out of 18 registered electoral trusts are not available on the website of the Election Commission of India even after two months since the deadline ended. These are: Janpragati, Janhit, Small Donations, JaiHind and Bhartiya Bhumi electoral trusts, the ADR report said.

The nonprofit has recommended to the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) that it withdraw the approval given to JaiHindi as it has never received any contribution since registration. The electoral trust scheme provides for withdrawal of CBDT approval if the trust has ceased its activities, or its activities are not genuine or are not carried out in accordance with the scheme.

The names of electoral trusts do not disclose the name of the company or the group of companies which set up these trusts. The ADR has suggested that the name of the parent company be included in the trust’s name for the sake of greater transparency about the details of corporates which fund political parties.

All corporates should disclose details of their political contributions through their websites or in annual reports for increased transparency in political financing, the ADR said.

The court had issued notice to Sanjay Singh, currently in jail in connection with the Delhi excise policy scam case, but he did not respond to it. Hence the court proceeded ex parte against him.

Addressing a press conference in Lucknow on August 8, 2021, the AAP leader had accused Mahendra Singh, the then Jal Shakti minister of Uttar Pradesh, of indulging in corruption in the implementation of the Jal Jeevan Mission.

Mahendra Singh subsequently filed a civil defamation suit against the AAP MP and sought Rs 21 lakh in damages.

The court also directed the AAP leader to remove videos and print materials on his remarks from social media platforms.

The court had constituted a committee of six members to investigate and submit a report on the matter. It also asked the markets regulator SEBI to probe the matter.

The company, in consultation with the book-running lead managers, may consider a further offer of equity shares of up to 33.12 lakh shares as pre-IPO placement. If such placement is completed, the fresh issue size will be reduced.

The proceeds from the fresh issue will be used for funding the working capital requirements of the company and general corporate purposes.

Over its decade-long history, Gretex Share Broking served as a market maker for 31 companies listed on SME platforms of stock exchanges. Additionally, it holds a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Gretex Corporate Services, its promoter, to act as market makers for 28 upcoming SME IPOs.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tech-view-as-a-sell-on-rise-strategy-is-in-play-what-nifty-traders-should-do-on-thursday-expiry/articleshow/106519294.cms,"Nifty on Wednesday ended 148 points lower to form a long negative candle on the daily chart placed at the edge of breaking below the immediate support of 10-day EMA.

The positive chart pattern like higher tops and bottoms is intact on the daily chart and the present weakness could be in line with the formation of new higher bottoms of the sequence. A decisive move below 21,500 levels could open the next downside of 21,255 (20-day EMA) and the next 20,980 levels in the near term. Immediate resistance is placed at 21,670, Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said.

What should traders do? Here’s what analysts said:

Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities
Nifty dipped below the support level of 21,650, resulting in a decline towards 21,500. The prevailing sentiment appears weak, highlighted by the index closing below the crucial support at 21,650. If it continues to drop below 21,500 in the upcoming days, it could potentially exacerbate the negative sentiment, especially with expectations of substantial unwinding by put writers below 21,500. The broader market outlook suggests a sell-on-rise strategy as long as it stays below 21,650.

Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan
On the daily charts, we can observe that Nifty closed in the red for the second consecutive day. Intraday pullbacks are being sold into and the 20-hour moving average (21,642) is acting as a stiff resistance. On the way down the Nifty has now reached the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level (21507) which is likely to act as a make-or-break level for the Nifty. We expect Nifty to hold on to this support and prepare a base for the next leg of upthe move. Overall, we believe that the fall is a retracement of the previous rise from 20976 – 21834 and not a trend reversal, and thus this dip should be used as a buying opportunity.

Osho Krishan, Sr. Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research, AngelOne
On the technical front, our markets are gradually losing their sheen as it forms lower highs – lower lows on the hourly time frame. The bullish gap around 21,500-21,475 withholds the last ray of hope for bulls, as any breach below could derive a further round of profit-booking in the market and it may plunge lower to 21,200 (21 DEMA) in the coming period. On the flip side, a decisive surge above 21600-21650 could only restrengthen the primary momentum. For now, it is important to maintain caution as we stand on a crucial make-or-break zone and could attract traction on either side in the comparable period.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sc-declines-sit-cbi-probe-into-allegations-against-adani-group/articleshow/106518663.cms,"New Delhi, In a significant win for the Adani Group, the Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to transfer the probe into allegations of stock price manipulation by the Indian corporate giant to a special investigation team or the CBI, saying market regulator SEBI was conducting a ""comprehensive investigation"" and its conduct ""inspires confidence"". Holding that the power of the court to enter the regulatory domain of Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in framing delegated legislation was limited, the apex court directed the market regulator to complete the two pending investigations expeditiously, preferably within three months.

The term delegated legislation or secondary legislation refers to laws made by individuals or bodies authorised by the legislature to create detailed regulations under a specific Act of Parliament.

A bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud said reliance placed by the petitioners on newspaper articles or reports by third-party organisations like Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) to question a comprehensive investigation by a specialised regulator does not inspire confidence.

The bench, also comprising Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, noted that SEBI has completed 22 out of the 24 investigations into allegations levelled against the Adani Group.

Reacting to the verdict, billionaire entrepreneur Gautam Adani said truth has prevailed and his group will continue to contribute to India's growth story.

""The Hon'ble Supreme Court's judgement shows that: Truth has prevailed. Satyameva Jayate,"" Adani said in a post on X. ""I am grateful to those who stood by us,"" he added.

In its 46-page judgement, the bench said, ""The facts of this case do not warrant a transfer of investigation from SEBI. In an appropriate case, this court does have the power to transfer an investigation being carried out by the authorized agency to an SIT or CBI.""

""Such a power is exercised in extraordinary circumstances when the competent authority portrays a glaring, wilful and deliberate inaction in carrying out the investigation. The threshold for the transfer of investigation has not been demonstrated to exist,"" the verdict penned by the CJI said.

The apex court delivered its verdict on a batch of petitions on the Adani-Hindenburg Research row over allegations of stock price manipulation by the Indian business conglomerate.

The Supreme Court said the SEBI's status report and the details of the 24 investigations do not indicate inaction by the market regulator.

""In fact, to the contrary, the course of conduct by SEBI inspires confidence that SEBI is conducting a comprehensive investigation,"" the bench said.

It said the allegations of conflict of interest levelled against some members of the court-appointed expert committee are ""unsubstantiated and are rejected"".

""SEBI and the investigative agencies of the Union government shall probe into whether the loss suffered by Indian investors due to the conduct of Hindenburg Research and any other entities in taking short positions involved any infraction of the law and if so, suitable action shall be taken,"" the bench said.

It said the court must refrain from substituting its own wisdom for the regulatory policies of SEBI and the scope of judicial review, when examining a policy framed by a specialised regulator, is to scrutinise whether it violates fundamental rights, any provision of the Constitution, any statutory provision or is manifestly arbitrary.

""No valid grounds have been raised for this court to direct SEBI to revoke its amendments to the FPI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) regulations and the LODR (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) regulations which were made in exercise of its delegated legislative power,"" it said.

""The procedure followed in arriving at the current shape of the regulations does not suffer from irregularity or illegality. The FPI regulations and LODR regulations have been tightened by the amendments in question,"" the bench said.

It said the court has not interfered with the outcome of the investigations by SEBI and the regulator should take its probe to their logical conclusion in accordance with law.

""The reliance placed by the petitioner on the OCCPR report to suggest that SEBI was lackadaisical in conducting the investigation is rejected. A report by a third-party organization without any attempt to verify the authenticity of its allegations cannot be regarded as conclusive proof,"" the court said.

The bench noted that the petitioners had also relied on a January 31, 2014 letter sent by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) to then SEBI chairperson which purportedly alerted the market regulator about potential stock market manipulation by the Adani group through over-valuation of the import of power equipment from a UAE-based subsidiary.

""Further, the petitioner's reliance on the letter by the DRI is misconceived as the issue has already been settled by concurrent findings of DRI's Additional Director General, the CESTAT and this court,"" it said.

The bench said the Centre and the SEBI shall constructively consider the suggestions of the expert committee in its report and take any further actions as are necessary to strengthen the regulatory framework, protect investors and ensure the orderly functioning of the securities market.

It said the public interest jurisprudence under Article 32 of the Constitution was expanded by the apex court to secure access to justice and provide ordinary citizens with the opportunity to highlight legitimate causes before the top court.

""However, petitions that lack adequate research and rely on unverified and unrelated material tend to, in fact, be counterproductive. This word of caution must be kept in mind by lawyers and members of civil society alike,"" it said.

The judgment was delivered on PILs filed by lawyers Vishal Tiwari, M L Sharma, Congress leader Jaya Thakur, and Anamika Jaiswal.

The Adani Group stocks suffered a bloodbath on the bourses after Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including those about fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against the business conglomerate.

The Adani Group dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements."

The report also notes phenomenal growth recorded in new office completions, reaching a remarkable 0.8 million sq ft in 2023, a staggering 332 per cent jump YoY, making it the highest volume recorded in the past five years.

The surge was fueled by robust occupier interest across various sectors, indicating a positive economic outlook.

""The commercial market in Kolkata is now witnessing a consistent rise in transactions exceeding half a million with significant engagement from India-facing business as Kolkata remains the gateway to eastern and north-eastern India. The current 9-year high in office leasing transactions underscores a robust interest from occupiers, signalling potential future growth,"" Knight Frank India Senior Director (East) Abhijit Das said.

In the residential sector, Kolkata's real estate market witnessed a robust demand throughout 2023, driven by the continuation of the stamp duty rebate. A total of 14,999 residential units were sold, showcasing a significant 16 per cent growth in sales volume over 2022. This represents a notable recovery from a 10 per cent decline observed in 2022 compared to 2021.

The demand for residential units also prompted a substantial increase in new launches, with a notable 28 per cent YoY growth compared to 2022 prompting developers to launch introduced fresh inventory to meet the surge in demand.

In the residential segment, ticket sizes between Rs 5 million and Rs 10 million witnessed an impressive 71 per cent YoY growth, indicating a strong appetite for mid-range properties.

The office leasing rental market in 2023 saw an 11 per cent increase on average, primarily driven by heightened demand. Business districts like Salt Lake City and Rajarhat New Town experienced double-digit YoY rental growth, with limited space availability contributing to the surge in rent prices.

Upon her return from the operation theatre, it was discovered that Sandhya's gold mangalya chain weighing 72 grams and valued at approximately Rs 4.5 lakh was missing.

Udhay reported the incident to the Bellandur police, indicating that about 25 people in the hospital had access to the room where Sandhya was shifted after the surgery.

The Environment Agency, issuing the flood warning, emphasized the peril to life, cautioning that the water may be both deep and fast-flowing. Meanwhile, properties near the River Severn in the West Midlands are grappling with flooding, in some instances for the fourth time this winter, according to BBC correspondent Phil Mackie in Worcester.

In addition to this, a severe flood warning has been issued for the River Ritec in Tenby, southwestern Wales, with residents of the Kiln Park caravan site being warned about potential limitations on vehicle access, coupled with reports of sewage leakage into the water.

Several other flood warnings are in place across Wales and one in Scotland. On Wednesday, the Met Office released a new yellow warning for rain, encompassing the southern part of England, effective from 12:00 GMT on Thursday until 03:00 on Friday. The forecast anticipates the possibility of further flooding, travel disruptions, and power outages.

The UK's rail network faced substantial disruptions on Tuesday due to flooding and power failures, with ongoing issues in some regions on Wednesday. Network Rail expects continued disruption in the south and southwest of England due to displaced trains and crew.

Major roads in England have been closed due to flooding, including the A52 westbound carriageway between Nottingham and Edwalton.

Ross Easton from the Energy Networks Association reported on BBC Radio 4's Today program that 125,000 homes had been reconnected to the grid, but 10,000 homes remained without power, primarily in central, southern, and southeastern parts of England.

The inclement weather led to incidents such as a woman in Orpington, southeast London, being hospitalized after being hit by a falling tree, and in Greenwich, southeast London, a scaffolding panel from a building fell, obstructing a road.

The storm, named Henk, was the eighth named storm in three months. Its delayed naming, only hours before impact, was attributed to its small size and early development on Tuesday morning.

Although the precise impact of climate change on storm frequency remains uncertain, rising sea surface temperatures are known to fuel more intense storms with increased rainfall. The world has already experienced a 1.1°C rise in temperatures since the industrial era, and continued global warming depends on substantial emissions reductions by governments worldwide.

The Met Office noted that 2023 provisionally ranked as the second warmest year in the UK since records began, with 2022 holding the record. Human activities continue to drive global temperature increases, resulting in more severe heatwaves and rising sea levels.

The projects were launched at a function attended by hundreds of islanders here.

This includes the Kochi-Lakshadweep Islands Submarine Optical Fibre Connection (KLI - SOFC) project, which he announced in his Independence Day speech in August 2020 at the Red Fort.

The transformational initiative aims to overcome the challenge of slow internet speed on Lakshadweep Island.

This will result in an increase in internet speed by more than 100 times, from 1.7 Gbps to 200 Gbps, in the islands, according to officials.

They said Lakshadweep is now connected through a submarine optical fibre cable, marking a significant shift in communication infrastructure.

This will enhance internet services, telemedicine, e-governance, education, digital banking, currency usage and literacy in the islands, they said.

The Prime Minister also inaugurated the Low Temperature Thermal Desalination (LTTD) plant at Kadmat, which will produce 1.5 lakh litres of clean drinking water every day.

Additionally, he dedicated to the nation the Functional Household Tap Connections (FHTC) in all households on the Agatti and Minicoy islands.

Other projects launched by Modi include the solar power plant at Kavaratti, the first-ever battery-backed solar power project in Lakshadweep.

He also laid the foundation stone for the renovation of the primary health care facility in Kalpeni and the construction of five model Anganwadi centres (Nand Ghars) in the five islands of Androth, Chetlat, Kadmat, Agatti and Minicoy.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/adani-vs-hindenburg-research-what-you-need-to-know/articleshow/106512824.cms,"India's Adani Group won relief from the Supreme Court on Wednesday when judges ruled that the company, hit hard by a U.S. short-seller's allegations last year of improper business dealings, does not need to face additional investigation.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has been investigating the group after Hindenburg Research's report in January last year set off an over $150 billion selloff in the conglomerate's stocks despite the company's denials of wrongdoing. The stocks have since recovered partially.

Here are some facts about billionaire Gautam Adani, his group and Hindenburg's allegations.

WHO ARE ADANI AND HINDENBURG?
Gautam Adani built his empire after starting out as a commodities trader. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is from the same state and their relationship has long come under scrutiny by Modi's opponents.

Before Hindenburg's report, Adani, a school drop-out, rose to become Asia's richest person, with businesses across ports, power generation, airports, mining, renewables, media and cement.

Hindenburg Research was founded in 2017 by Nathan Anderson. It is a forensic financial research firm which analyses equity, credit and derivatives. It has a track-record of finding corporate wrongdoings and placing bets against the companies.

WHAT DID HINDENBURG AND ADANI SAY?
Hindenburg disclosed last year it held short positions in Adani companies through U.S.-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivatives. It released a report that alleged Adani improperly used tax havens, and also flagged concerns about high debt levels at the company.

The Adani group called the report baseless and termed the allegations ""unsubstantiated speculations"".

WHAT HAPPENED AT ADANI AFTER HINDENBURG REPORT?
Hindenburg's report sparked a $150 billion meltdown in shares of Adani's publicly listed companies last year. Though the shares are still down roughly $47 billion from their levels before the Hindenburg report, they have staged a smart recovery.

That's partially because the ports-to-power conglomerate welcomed investors like Abu Dhabi conglomerate International Holding and investment firm GQG to shore up confidence by diluting some of the family's tight shareholding.

WHAT WAS MARKET REGULATOR'S PROBE, COURT'S VERDICT?

SEBI has been investigating the conglomerate after Hindenburg's allegations and the probe was being overseen by the Supreme Court.

On Wednesday, in response to cases brought forward by public interest litigants, the court said the facts of the case did not warrant a transfer of investigation from the market regulator to other agencies. The apex court also directed the regulator to complete its investigation of the group within three months.

WHAT DOES THE COURT VERDICT MEAN FOR THE ADANI GROUP?
Gautam Adani said the ruling showed truth has prevailed. Analysts said the decision means SEBI will have the final say on the matter and signals regulatory scrutiny won't increase further.

They also said the verdict will help global investors to have more confidence in investing in the shares of Adani Group.

Shares of various Adani Group companies surged after the ruling, including Adani Energy Solutions, Adani Total Gas, Adani Green Energy and the flagship business Adani Enterprises.

""By and large, a clean chit has been given to the Adani Group. The court has also restored Sebi's credibility and the ball is now in the regulator's court,"" Advocate Sumit Agrawal of Regstreet Law Advisors told ETMarkets.

Adani stocks rallied up to 10% with and leading the show as the conglomerate’s market capitalisation crossed the Rs 15 lakh crore mark once again.



1) While delivering the verdict, a Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, said there is no ground for transferring the case to an SIT, CBI or any other agency.

""The facts of this case do not warrant a transfer of investigation from SEBI. In an appropriate case, this court does have the power to transfer an investigation being carried out by an authorised agency to an SIT or to the CBI. Such a power is exercised in extraordinary circumstances…,"" the bench said.

2) The apex court has also restored Sebi's credibility which was questioned by some political parties. ""They have agreed to Sebi's process which is a very positive takeaway for me as an ex-Sebi official,"" Advocate PR Ramesh said.

CJI also observed that the power of the court to enter the regulatory domain of Sebi in framing delegated legislation was limited.

3) ""The court has completely rejected the report by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). Any third party report without verification is rejected with a caveat that if only verifiable documents are provided then only it can be relied upon,"" Agrawal said while commenting on the ruling.

4) While noting that Sebi has completed 22 out of the 24 investigations into the allegations levelled against the Adani Group, the court asked the regulator to complete its probe into two pending cases within 3 months. ""The court is not going to be interfering into Sebi's investigation as it is going on the right track,"" Agrawal said.

5) The judgment further said that the government and the SEBI should look into infractions of the law, if any, by Hindenburg on short-selling and take suitable actions.

""The government should also investigate because there was a knee-jerk reaction in the market. The fall was not caused by the Adani group. Somebody hammered the market. The government may leave the investigation to Sebi,"" Ramesh said."

Subsequently, the findings resulted in 542 enforcement actions, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said in a release on Wednesday.

The number of surveillance activities rose 26 per cent last year compared to 2022. Also, the number of enforcement actions increased 77 per cent last year compared to 305 enforcement actions taken against non-compliant personnel, airlines, and other operators in 2022.

These enforcement actions included financial penalties against airlines such as Air India, AirAsia (India), IndiGo and SpiceJet. Besides, the watchdog had temporarily suspended its approval to Air India's training facilities, as per the release.

Enforcement actions were also taken against erring pilots/cabin crew, Air Traffic Controllers, non-scheduled airlines, flying training organisations and aerodrome operators, it said.

Particularly directed at major exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, Kraken and others, this notice has garnered attention prompting discussions on compliance and potential repercussions.

Edul Patel, the Founder and CEO of Mudrex, in an exclusive conversation with the EconomicTimes.com offered detailed insights into the implications of FIU’s directive of issuing show cause notice to offshore entities operating within India's rapidly expanding cryptocurrency sector. He emphasised the ramifications of this move on the industry's regulatory landscape and its potential impact on offshore exchanges and the Indian crypto users.

Understanding FIU's role and its call to action
The Financial Intelligence Unit plays a critical role under the Indian Ministry of Finance, diligently tracking illicit financial transactions. Its overarching goal is to identify suspicious activities, combat money laundering, and prevent funding for unlawful purposes, aligning with global efforts led by bodies such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

""The Financial Intelligence Unit operates under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), ensuring a vigilant stance against terrorist financing and money laundering activities,"" commented Edul Patel, Co-Founder & CEO, Mudrex.

While traditional financial sectors were long under its purview, the recent inclusion of crypto businesses marked a significant regulatory shift earlier this year. ‘This shift arrived as part of the government's continuous efforts to streamline and regulate the industry comprehensively’ explained Patel. He further added that with this amendment, crypto entities are now expected to adhere to the PMLA regulations and report transactions akin to traditional financial institutions.

FIU’s directive and its implications for crypto exchanges
Elaborating further on the FIU’s directive, Patel highlighted its significance, stating, ""the notice specifically targets non-compliant offshore crypto entities, urging them to report transactions to prevent misuse for illegal purposes."" Highlighting the directive's focused nature in addressing non-compliant offshore crypto entities, Patel emphasised the imperative of transaction reporting. He spotlighted its significance in ensuring user protection and fostering accountability.

""This notice marks a pivotal step in formalising India's regulatory framework for crypto,"" said Patel, stressing the critical role of such compliance in shaping the country's crypto regulations. He urged collaborative efforts between financial institutions and governmental bodies to regulate and monitor crypto transactions, advocating for robust support to advance industry maturity.

Advice for crypto investors amidst India’s evolving regulatory landscape
Addressing concerns among Indian crypto investors using non-compliant platforms, Patel advised a strategic move of relocating assets to FIU-compliant entities like Mudrex. He highlighted the safety and legal recourse provided by compliant entities in cases of incidents like hacking or disputes, aligning with the government's push for transparent crypto transactions.

To deposit crypto on Mudrex, users can follow the following steps:

First, obtain your Mudrex public wallet address.
Then, initiate a withdrawal from your current platform, specifying the Mudrex wallet address and network.
Confirm the deposit on Mudrex after verifying the transaction details.
Mudrex offers robust security measures, seamless transfers, dedicated support, and a rare UPI payment option among other benefits. Patel further underscored Mudrex's unwavering commitment to compliance, safety, and personalised user experiences, ensuring a reliable and transparent platform for crypto investments. He also highlighted Mudrex's global recognition, being registered as a virtual asset service provider in the EU.

Responding to inquiries about potential bans on non-compliant platforms, he drew parallels to prior bans on certain apps, indicating potential restrictions via URLs, reaffirming the government's commitment to ensuring transparency and accountability within the crypto sector. He further stressed on the necessity for global platforms to adhere to Indian regulatory norms, fostering a safer environment for investors.

Benefits of transferring crypto assets to FIU-compliant Mudrex platform
In the realm of transitioning cryptocurrency from non-compliant platforms like Binance to FIU-compliant entities such as Mudrex, crucial insights emerge regarding crypto deposits valued at $1000. Mudrex stands out, offering fee-free crypto deposits and exclusive support for the BEP-20 network, distinguishing itself as the sole platform catering to this network. In contrast, Zebpay and CoinDCX impose a $15 fee for crypto deposits, while CoinSwitch presently does not facilitate such deposits, and WazirX currently disallows them.

An important note underscores the necessity for users transferring crypto from Binance to Mudrex to opt for the BEP-20 network to capitalise on Mudrex's zero-fee advantage. For transfers from other platforms to Mudrex, the platform does not impose fees on crypto deposits, apart from potential fees from the transferring platform. Mudrex is adaptable across major networks like ERC20, TRC20, among others, and typically processes a crypto deposit within 5-10 minutes.

Pathway towards compliance and future regulatory framework for crypto
The FIU's intent is crystal clear: to formalise the crypto asset class within India’s regulatory framework. This move not only emphasises the need for clear reporting mechanisms but also provides a channel for user protection and legal recourse, crucial for a burgeoning market like crypto. With a mandated 30-day compliance window, entities are pressed to register and commence reporting. Failure to do so might lead to potential bans, mirroring measures taken against platforms like TikTok in the past.

Expressing his support for the government's initiative, Patel stressed upon the importance of a structured approach to formalise the crypto sector in India. He highlights collaborative efforts through entities like the Bharat Web 3 Association, aiming to educate the regulators, policymakers and users amid this evolving landscape, and also advocate for a conducive regulatory framework.

Addressing concerns about regulatory complexity, Patel acknowledged the challenges of adhering to the compliance, while also underscoring its pivotal role in ensuring user protection and orderly functioning of the market operations. He predicted the gradual evolution of a comprehensive regulatory framework tailored for India’s crypto landscape.

Conclusion: Shaping the future of India's Crypto Landscape
In conclusion, the FIU's directive signifies a watershed moment in shaping India's crypto landscape, heralding an era of compliance, user safeguarding, and the seamless integration of crypto within a robust regulatory framework. As the countdown continues within the 30-day window, the call for offshore entities to comply or face potential bans resounds. This strategic move aligns with the trajectory of formalising crypto in India, laying the foundation for a structured and regulated environment and setting the stage for a more mature and secure ecosystem benefiting investors and businesses alike."

He also questioned the ""silence"" of BJP MPs on the matter.

In a statement here, he said the state government had declared 223 taluks among the total 236 as drought-hit, and there is a loss of standing crop in over 48.19 lakh hectare, as per study report from experts.

The small and marginal farmers are in dire straits, Surjewala said.

""The state government in a memorandum to the Centre had sought to release Rs 18,177.44 crore relief funds, which included Rs 4,663.12 crore towards input subsidy, 12,577.86 crore for emergency relief and another Rs 363.68 crore to save cattle heads. However, the union government plays deaf to the state's memorandum,"" he alleged.

Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Revenue Minister Krishna Byre Gowda had also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah and appealed for the release of central aid to Karnataka, Surjewala noted.

Deputy Chief minister DK Shivakumar had also met the Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and other senior officials of the Agriculture ministry and presented a memorandum, but still a ""mute response"" from the Centre, Surjewala said.

""Centre should also take steps to release other stalled grants,"" he said.

He also alleged that MPs from Karnataka remain mute spectators on Centre's ""injustice"" to the State and criticised them for not responding to the plight of farmers, who are in great distress.

""They are waiting for immediate relief from the Centre. There are 26 BJP and one BJP supported MPs in Karnataka, I failed to understand what they are doing in support of the distressed farmers and people of Karnataka,"" Surjewala said.

The Congress, the biggest member of the opposition alliance, had come second in the seat in the 2019 polls. The BJP had won both the seats from the state, where Assembly polls are held simultaneously with the Lok Sabha elections.

In a statement, JD(U) general secretary Afaque Ahmad said the party's state unit president Ruhi Tangung will be its candidate from the constituency.

""This announcement is being made as directed by party president Shri Nitish Kumar,"" he added.

Bihar Chief Minister Kumar was recently elected JD(U)'s national president amid reports of ""disquiet"" in his party at their leader not being given any role in the INDIA bloc so far.

As Kumar has a history of alliances with parties aligned to two ends of ideological spectrum, there has also been speculation about his future move.

The video has gone viral. The incident happened when South Africa's India origin player Keshav Maharaj came in to bat when his team were reeling at 35 for six in 15.5 overs. Eventually, South Africa were bundled out for 55, with Mohammed Siraj taking a took a career-best six for 15. South Africa’s decision to bat first backfired spectacularly on a pitch which offered bounce and seam movement.

It was South Africa's lowest total since they were bowled out for 36 and 45 against Australia in Melbourne in 1931/32. Siraj exploited the conditions superbly, with none of the batsmen looking comfortable against him. Top-scorer Kyle Verreynne (15) was Siraj's sixth victim in his ninth over. This is the last Test match of South Africa's stand-in Dean Elgar, who was had scored a match-winning century in the first test.

During the third ODI at Boland Park in Paarl, another interesting incident took place involving Keshav Maharaj. The stump mic captured a viral exchange between KL Rahul and Keshav Maharaj. In the 33rd over, as Maharaj entered the field, the stadium DJ coincidentally played the song 'Ram Siya Ram' in the background. With a smile, wicketkeeper KL Rahul jokingly highlighted to Maharaj the recurring nature of this song whenever he came to bat. Maharaj responded with a confirming 'yes'. Virat Kohli is among the invitees for the inauguration of Ram Temple in Ayodhya.

However, he remains 103 rating points behind the leader Kane Williamson, with Joe Root and Steve Smith securing the second and third positions.

Meanwhile, Rohit Sharma, the Indian skipper, dropped to 14th place after managing scores of five and zero in Centurion. On the other hand, KL Rahul rose 11 places to 51st after scoring 101 and four in the series opener.

After receiving flak from the world Jewish community, and popular brands like Gap and Adidas, Miami's five-star hotel Four Seasons is not happy with him. According to 'Page Six', West seems to have worn out his welcome at his favorite hotel. The report suggests that the rapper has been camping out at the five-star Four Seasons at the Surf Club resort for quite some time. He even has set up a recording studio at the hotel. But the hotel and its people, particularly its security staff, are upset with the star's tendency to have late-night guests.


Ku Klux Klan mask

Kanye West performed in a black Ku Klux Klan mask at a wild party at the hotel and around 15 SUVs arrived at the luxe hotel until around 5 a.m. The rapper is out of town at present, but he is not likely to get a warm reception at Four Seasons in Miami.

The rapper has tried to reach out to the people he is believed to have offended before his 'Vultures' album, co-created with Ty Dollar Sign is released. Kanye West last week issued an apology in Hebrew to the Jewish community for his 'unintended' antisemitic outburst in Las Vegas earlier this month.

Kanye West's apology to Jews

He wrote in Hebrew, ""I sincerely apologize to the Jewish community for any unintended outburst caused by my words or actions, it was not my intention to hurt or disrespect, and I deeply regret any pain I may have caused.""

He went on a tirade in his Sin City hotel room in which he ranted and raved about Zionists, Donald Trump, Adolf Hitler and many more people.

The S&P BSE Sensex fell more than 500 points while the Nifty50 managed to hold on to 21,500 levels.

Sectorally, buying was seen in utilities, realty, power, oil & gas while selling was seen in metals and IT which were down more than 2% each.

Stocks that were in focus include names like Alok Industries which was up 7%, Adani Ports closed with gains of more than 1% to hit a fresh high, and FDC was up more than 3% to hit a fresh high.

We have collated a list of three stocks that either hit a fresh 52-week high, or an all-time high or saw a volume or a price breakout.

We spoke to an analyst on how one should look at these stocks the next trading day entirely from an educational point of view:

Analyst: Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.

Alok Industries (52-Week High)


The consequent selling pressure did not spare Alok Industries, despite the previous day’s voluminous rise successfully registering further rise on Wednesday, and the turn lower thereof culminated in forming a gravestone doji candlestick pattern, traditionally seen as a reversal pattern.

However, the favoured view expects the impact of the gravestone doji to be limited, and unless we get back below 21, the stock is poised towards 31 or 37 in a couple of months’ time frame.
Agencies


Adani Ports (All Time High)
The doji formed on Wednesday suggests indecision, but the huge volume suggests that buyers were keen on putting a very strong show of solidarity, despite the broad market sell-off getting in the way.

And, despite being at record peaks, the stock was not seen painting neat patterns en route, suggesting equally turbulent days ahead. However, we are inclined to see the ongoing patterns evolve fully into bullish continuation patterns, favouring a projected objective of 1240 in a month or so.

However, the stock closed inside the parallel range suggesting that a decline is likely to precede the uptrend. Towards this end, we favour a downside marker at 1053 or the base of the range at 986.
Agencies

FDC (All Time high with volume)
Though FDC gave a lot of gains from the top, it has made the intention clear that it is about to embark on a strong directional upside. The formation of a cup and handle pattern supports this view.

We shall lie in wait for the complete maturing of this pattern, which should ideally aim for 440-480 initially. The downside marker may be placed below the base of the handle at 380.

The FMR allows visa-free travel for tribes residing on both sides of the India-Myanmar border, up to a distance of 16 km inside the neighboring country. However, due to the involvement of FMR in facilitating illegal immigration, trafficking of narcotics, and ethnic violence in Manipur, the government is planning to make visas mandatory for Myanmar nationals entering through the land border, as part of a reevaluation.

The infiltration of arms, ammunition, and narcotics from Pakistan into Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir through the use of drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been a significant challenge for security agencies in recent years.

According to BSF DG Nitin Agrawal, the force has recovered a total of 90 drones between November 1, 2022, and October 31, 2023. Out of these, 81 were found in Punjab, while nine were recovered in Rajasthan.

BSF sources have reported an increase in drone sightings, ranging from 300 to 400 in the past year. However, with enhanced surveillance through handheld static and vehicle-mounted anti-drone systems, smugglers transporting drug consignments from Pakistan are facing difficulties in evading the BSF. As a result, they have been forced to modify their tactics, such as using alternative routes in Rajasthan due to increased surveillance in Punjab. However, their attempts were foiled after an intelligence leak led to the seizure of four drug consignments in Rajasthan.

In recent times, smugglers have been employing smaller drones with lighter payloads, typically around 750 grams. Most of these drones are of Chinese make, as they are easily accessible and more affordable compared to those from Turkey or Iran.

The Fed minutes, due later in the day, and key labour market data, expected later this week, will help assess if the optimism over potential rate cuts is justified.

The 30-share BSE benchmark Sensex plunged 536 points or 0.75% to settle at 71,356. The broader NSE fell 148 points or 0.69% to end at 21,517.

Among the Sensex stocks, JSW Steel and Tata Steel were the top laggards, falling over 3% each. Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, TCS, and Nestle India also ended in the red. On the other hand, IndusInd Bank, ITC, Bharti Airtel, SBI, and Axis Bank closed in the green.

Adani Group stocks closed up to 12% higher following a favourable verdict from the Supreme Court. In the 10-pack group of stocks, Adani Energy Solutions was the top gainer, rising nearly 12%, while Adani Total Gas closed with a 10% upper circuit. Adani Power also closed with a 5% upper circuit.

On the sectoral front, Nifty IT closed 2.5% lower ahead of the release of the minutes. Nifty Metal and Nifty Financial Services also closed 1.8% and 0.4% lower, respectively.

The market breadth was skewed in the favour of the bulls. About 2,198 stocks gained, 1,638 declined, and 109 remained unchanged on the BSE.


The lack of fresh triggers and concerns over valuation influenced investors to stay sidelined, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

""Importantly, the market was waiting for the Fed minutes for rate insights. As a rebound in the US 10-year yield and an uptick in the dollar index indicate whether Fed may not turn as dovish as expected,"" Nair added.

Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan, said: ""We believe that the fall is a retracement of the previous rise from 20,976 – 21,834 and not a trend reversal and thus this dip should be used as a buying opportunity.""


Global stock markets extended a New Year slide on Wednesday as market optimism about early US interest rate cuts ebbed and the latest escalation of hostilities in the Middle East weighed on sentiment.

Europe's STOXX 600 share index dipped 0.1% and Asia Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.3%. The tech-focused Nasdaq slid 1.6% on Tuesday, dragged lower by a nearly 3% drop in Apple to a seven-week low after Barclays downgraded its shares.


The minutes of the Fed's December policy meeting are due later in the day and will offer clues on how well-placed market expectations are about potential cuts in policy rates.
Investors are currently pricing in a near 75% chance of a Fed rate cut in March, down from about 85% a week earlier.


Brent crude oil futures were 0.4% lower at $75.59 a barrel as expectations of ample supply outweighed concerns about disruptions to Red Sea shipping routes for now.


The Indian rupee closed marginally higher on Wednesday, supported by dollar sales from foreign banks, even as most of its Asian peers fell pressured by a recovery in the US dollar index. The rupee ended at 83.2750 against the dollar, slightly higher compared with its close at 83.3175 in the previous session.

The dollar index last quoted at 102.3 after having risen 0.8% overnight as market participants moderated bets on interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The 10-year US Treasury yield rose to 3.98%."

""I just kept going but the older I get, the more I'm kind of like, I would like to find something to just settle on. I do feel like I have one more album in me, but I would probably choose acting. I am going to wanna chill because I'm tired,"" she said in Tuesday's episode of the 'Smartless' podcast.

Gomez, who will next be seen in the fourth season of Hulu's 'Only Murders in the Building', said she always wanted to be an actor.

It is expected that both sides will sign an agreement on the modalities that would facilitate Nepal exporting 10,000 megawatt of power to India in the next 10 years in line with a decision taken by the leadership of the two countries in June.

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said Jaishankar will co-chair along with his Nepalese counterpart N P Said a meeting of the India-Nepal Joint Commission, the highest bilateral platform for reviewing the overall ties.

""External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will visit Kathmandu from January 4 to 5 on the invitation of the Foreign Minister of Nepal, NP Saud for co-chairing the seventh meeting of the India-Nepal Joint Commission,"" it said.

The growth momentum in these housing markets is expected to be sustained in a steady manner in 2024 as likely interest rate reduction may help the performance of rate-sensitive affordable housing, which has so far remained subdued.

India’s top 8 property markets have registered a 5% growth in annual sales at over 3.29 lakh apartments in 2023, showed data from . Mumbai region registered the highest sales of 86,871 units demonstrating a 2% growth, while Kolkata witnessed the highest home sales growth, in terms of percentage, at 16% followed by Ahmedabad at 15% while grew at 13%.

“Real estate in India has grown steadily over the last few years, driven by factors such as rapid urbanization, infrastructure improvements, favorable demographics, and government policies geared towards growth. With economic growth projected at 7%, India has a solid foundation for the upcoming fiscal year,” said Niranjan Hiranandani, Chairman, NAREDCO National.

In terms of 12-month residential price change, Hyderabad saw the highest price movement of 11% in 2023. Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata registered 7% rise each. and Pune witnessed 6% and 5% growth, respectively, while Chennai and Ahmedabad witnessed 4% increase.

“Characterised by a shift towards more expensive properties, the residential market continues its onward march to achieve another watershed year in 2023. Without a doubt, this growth is led by the strong economic fundamentals of the country that gives buyers financial confidence to make long-term investments,” said Shishir Baijal, CMD, Knight Frank India.

According to him, dramatic improvement in home affordability over the last decade has helped home buyers despite a steady rise in prices. However, higher interest rates have resulted in reduced sales volumes in the affordable segment which may see an improvement if the rates are reduced later this year.

The renewed demand has led to an accelerated pace in residential development, with both half-yearly and annual volume of units launched reaching their highest levels in a decade. Notably, the launch volumes in 2022 and 2023 have surpassed the sales figures for the corresponding periods. Interestingly, this has occurred only thrice in the past ten years.

A total of 350,746 units were launched across the eight markets registering a rise of 7% on year. Mumbai recorded the highest residential launches in the country with supply of 93,051 units during the year. Kolkata witnessed the highest growth (in terms of percentage growth) at 28% followed by Bengaluru at 18%. NCR was the only market to record a marginal slowdown in launches.

“A dynamic market shift and buoyant consumer demand characterize the current Indian real estate market. Several compelling factors combine to make the Indian real estate sector a standout. These factors include rapid urbanization, political stability, infrastructure development, buoyant capital markets, institutional investment, favorable demographics, and rising incomes,” said Hiranandani.

According to him, a comprehensive landscape of growth, resilience, and innovation in the Indian real estate sector generates an overall sense of optimism for the financial year 2024-25. The surge in demand will result in a 10-12% increase in property prices in 2024, along with a snowball distribution of commercial and retail space.

Overall market’s unsold inventory levels across key eight cities rose 5% owing to higher launches. However, the quarter-to-sell level based on sales velocity for these markets has been consistently falling from 8.7 in 2020 to 5.9 quarters--less than 18 months--in 2023 and depicts a market with improving fundamentals despite increasing inventory.

Under stable policy regimes, experts believe, India's real estate market continues to attract homeowners as well as institutional investors. Since India has a housing deficit, the demand for sustainable housing is expected to remain buoyant. A strong pipeline of supplies is being developed.

There has been a surge in real estate demand in metro and tier cities due to rising disposable incomes and better employment opportunities among Indian demographics. To navigate the evolving landscape of the Indian real estate market, investors, developers, and homebuyers expected to closely monitor these seis key developments at macro and global levels. Ends"

The report offers a comprehensive guide on the adoption and monetisation of TV channels, including free TV and pay-TV, SVOD, premium AVOD, and UGC/Social Video advertising in 14 Asia Pacific markets.

In 2023, the report said the APAC video industry posted 5.5% growth, reaching $145 billion, primarily due to a 13% increase in online video sales to $57 billion. TV revenue rose less than 1% to $88 billion.

The largest video markets in 2023 were China ($64 billion), Japan ($32 billion), India ($13 billion), Korea ($12 billion), and Australia ($9.5 billion), it added.

Online SVOD grew 15% in 2023, reaching US$28 billion, while AVOD grew 11% to US$29 billion. UGC/social video dominates AVOD, with premium AVOD having a 20% share. Pay-TV subscription fees showed marginal growth in APAC, ex-China, with revenue declines in India and Japan.

MPA projections show APAC video industry revenues will grow at a CAGR of 2.6% between 2023–28, reaching US$165 billion by 2028, with China's matured market reaching US$70 billion by 2028.

It added that China will become more mature, growing at a 1.7% annual rate to reach US$70 billion by 2028, followed by Japan (US$35 billion), India (US$17 billion), Korea (US$14 billion), Australia (US$11 billion), and Indonesia (almost US$4 billion).

As per the report, the APAC online video sector is expected to grow at a 6.7% CAGR to reach US$78.5 billion by 2028, with marginally contracted TV industry revenues. Scaled TV markets like India, Japan, Korea, and Indonesia are expected to grow slower. There remain significant downside risks to TV advertising in Indonesia, India, and Korea.

Commenting on the findings of the report, MPA Managing and Executive Director Vivek Couto said: The Asia Pacific video industry continues to experience a secular shift from TV to online in terms of engagement and monetization. Improved connectivity, rising connected TV (CTV) penetration combined with the growth of local creator economies, investment in premium local content, and the wide availability of premium sports will continue to drive dollars and eyeballs online.""

In 2023, , ByteDance, , , iQIYI, Meta, , and Tencent accounted for 65% of APAC online video revenue. Local players like Jio Cinema and Zee-Sony in India are competing successfully and have the potential to scale.

""Strategic and private equity investments in the online video sector in China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia are enhancing local and regional companies' competitiveness. The online video sector is rationalizing with price increases, disciplined content, and marketing investment, ad tiers, new monetization strategies, and local market consolidation in Korea, Japan, and India,"" he added.

According to Couto, traditional linear TV faces pressure due to the shift to online and CTV growth, with some territories not expected to see a significant return on TV ad dollars.

He also stated that local broadcasters are leveraging premium AVOD and SVOD in Australia, India, Indonesia, and Japan without significantly disrupting pay-TV subscription revenue outside these markets.

""However, historically strong markets such as India and Korea are under pressure. Malaysia, the strongest pay-TV market in Southeast Asia, is experiencing a deeper contraction across the traditional pay-TV segment, partially offset by the growth of bundled broadband and IPTV. In Indonesia and Thailand, the online VOD opportunity is increasingly more attractive than pay-TV,"" he noted."

“We expect the Bank Nifty to consolidate and build a base for the next leg of upmove. On the upside immediate resistance is placed at 47,900 – 48,000,” he said.


The Nifty Bank opened marginally higher, but it failed to hold on to the momentum and hit an intraday low of 47,481. It recouped losses and closed above 47,700 levels.

The index faced resistance multiple times in the past few days around 48000. Hence, a close above the same give momentum to the bulls.

""The Bank Nifty experienced significant volatility on the day of the weekly expiry, maintaining a bearish trend as long as it stays below the key level of 48000. The index, however, managed to sustain above its 20-day moving average (20DMA) support,” Kunal Shah, Senior Technical and derivative Analyst at LKP Securities, said.

“It is crucial for the index to hold this level, as a decisive break below it could intensify the selling pressure in the market,” he said.

“Traders should closely monitor the movements around 48000 and 47688 for potential trend changes and trading opportunities,” recommended Shah."

We also do something called structured products, which is not naked equity, gives you the little plan B kind of a feel where if the markets do not do well, they become your great fallback option, that is what has been proved over the last 11 years of doing it. We are telling HNIs to be invested at least in 60% naked equity and not to quit smallcaps just yet.”

Look at how bond yields have rebounded after a very sharp fall. Even the dollar index peaking out at 107, is closer to rebound at 101. Is the market taking this for granted that mid year Fed rate cuts may actually start? Who knows, if inflation in the US turns out to be sticky, rates could remain higher for longer as this has happened in the past. What are your thoughts?
Feroze Azeez: Like you said, the market has this tendency to discount any information which they can think of with a high probability event. For example, from an Indian context, if the high probability is that the government will continue, the market starts discounting higher probability events and forgets the low probability events and when the low probability events happen, the markets give a knee-jerk reaction to adjust for that discounting.

Coming to the particular question, are they discounting rate cuts? Yes. Middle of this year now that we are in the year already. Since we are fundamental guys, we are managing long-term money, we look at how many rate cuts all central banks globally are expected to give in this calendar year. My estimate is 140 to 150 total rate cuts from all central banks put together.

If this were to happen, then you are very good. Because transactionally, the FOMC minutes might say differently, but if you got it strategically right, the rate cycle across the globe, then it helps because FII money comes from different sources as well, it is not just the US. So, from an investor standpoint, the money is made on capital markets, not on rate cuts because debt is not what people are so worried about when they are looking at rate cuts. They are looking at its impact on the equity markets.

So, to answer your pointed question, our estimate is about 140 to 150 rate cuts, all central banks put together and the high probability event is to discount and rightly so the rate cut cycle coming in any time in the mid of the year.

What were the hits & misses of largecap, midcap and smallcap funds in 2023? Feroze Azeez answers

The primary market part of D Street is likely to be very vibrant in 2024 as well and why not? Flows from HNI retail domestically, FIIs have also pumped in $11 billion this year and may be warming up more. Is this also a bit of an issue to suck the liquidity? Rs 45,000-50,000 crore worth of IPOs came in 2023 and almost double are expected in 2024. Is this a risk and can suck out liquidity which was otherwise meant to be coming the secondary market way?
Feroze Azeez: Two points – yes, you are absolutely right, FIIs have been pumping in money, but I think it is still scratching the surface. If you look at the December numbers, some $7-8 billion have come in and I think if this government continues and the capital markets have this immense affinity towards continuation of any government for that matter. If you look at and see the reaction of FIIs on the date of the last five general elections, you would see that they hate change and love continuity. If that were to happen, the magnitude of money which is waiting to get into India is very different and very high, that is point one.

Point two, when we speak of FIIs, we generally look at the split between their allocation between largecap, midcap and smallcap of the money which has come, which is a number which is not tracked so much but that is a very good number to understand how they behave in India today vis-à-vis in 2018. The FII allocation to smallcap was as good as nothing. Now, there is a reasonable portion of FII money going into smallcaps.

India story is being played by the FII not in the top 50 or the next 50 Nifty stocks, but the NSE 500 stocks, which is a huge game changer because re-ratings in the smallcap is very easy to do because they have smaller market caps. If there is a 10,000 crore market cap company with a free float of 3,000 crore market cap, if an FII decides to buy 100 crores, they will re-rate the PE themselves. That is the point I am trying to make from an FII standpoint.

Now coming to the point where a short-term variable is very critical is domestic liquidity. Also, if you try and decipher the kind of domestic liquidity, unfortunately total SIP numbers for this year are greater than the total net sale of equity mutual funds in India which means the HNIs have redeemed money and retail has been very smart over the last two-three years, but HNIs have been selling money from equity because of the over-analysis and the pessimism which is coming resultant to the overvaluation hypothesis which the HNI is doing.

I would love to believe that HNIs should follow retail this time around rather than the retail following the HNIs, at least the numbers say so.

Anand Rathi Wealth is doing so well catering to retail HNI across the country. I want to understand the HNI sense right now. In fact, it is eight years in a row we have had positive returns from the Nifty and they have made a lot of money. Are you telling me that the HNI bunch is now turning slightly sceptical and are in the mood to take profits?
Feroze Azeez: I think, yes. Whenever there is a 30% rise, some degree of profit taking happens, but I think money management is both heart and the mind. What happens is people have something called the recency bias, which means that they keep buying the asset which has done well over the last one year. It becomes very difficult to be prudent and rebalance their portfolio. Rebalancing as an academic activity seems a very practical thing, but in the real world people do not rebalance. When Nifty has gone up 30%, for example, our model portfolio has beaten Nifty by 12.5% this year.

If that is the kind of return, clients do not walk up and say why don’t we rebalance it and put some money in debt? They would say, why don’t I buy some more equity? As a distributor, our job is to show the data and bring back sanity and remove the recency bias that is one of the key job roles we define to remove the heart element and bring more mind in it than the heart. So, to answer your pointed question, HNI is not booking as much profit as he or she should because rebalancing is a need of most portfolios in India today because debt has given 6%, 7%, at best 8%, but on the equity side people have made 35-40% as well.

What is the Anand Rathi Wealth market outlook, which you have actually given out to your client community? For 2024, what are you telling them? What is the strategy to adopt?
Feroze Azeez: The strategy to adopt is to have naked equity of about 55-60%, that is what we do. We also do something called structured products, which is not naked equity, gives you the little plan B kind of a feel where if the markets do not do well, they become your great fallback option, that is what has been proved over the last 11 years of doing it. But to answer your pointed question, what we are telling HNIs is to be invested in your equity to at least the extent of 60% naked equity, point one. Point two, do not quit smallcaps just yet.

The kind of liquidity which is expected there is also not drying up, that is point two.

Point three, which is very important, is basically if you look at the allocations across different assets, people should exit out of real estate because they are not giving double digit returns and they are not expected to. We are telling them that the nominal GDP over the next five years for India is going to be between 12% to 14% and Nifty has proved time and again that it replicates nominal GDP over five-year periods, earning estimate for Nifty for the next year for us is about 1080 which I think is healthy from a 965 which is the financial year.

We have expected earnings growth when Nifty earning was at Rs 532 during peak of COVID August, we released a report that earnings are going to go through the roof and that is what ended up happening 532, 777, 821, 965 and 1080. This is the kind of fundamental earnings growth the direction of which is derived out of earnings growth for the medium term and economy takes the driver's seat for the long term."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/ed-raids-jharkhand-cms-press-advisor-others-in-illegal-mining-case/articleshow/106503035.cms,"The Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday raided the premises of Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren's press advisor, the officials of Sahibganj district and a former MLA as part of a money laundering probe into alleged illegal mining in the state, official sources said.

About a dozen locations in the state, including in state capital Ranchi and a premise in Rajasthan, are being raided by the central agency under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), they said.

The premises of press advisor Abhishek Prasad alias Pintu, the collector of Sahibganj district, ex-MLA Pappu Yadav, an architect, some jail department officials and a police constable are being searched by the agency officials, sources said.

An armed escort of central security forces went along with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials.

Prasad has been questioned by the ED in this case earlier.

Sources said the action was undertaken on the receipt of fresh inputs in the case.

The raids come on a day when the legislators of the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM)-led coalition in the state are meeting here to discuss the current political scenario in the backdrop of the ED's summons to the chief minister in an alleged land grab case.

Former Union minister and senior Congress leader Subodh Kant Sahay said that all efforts of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), including the ED raids, are aimed at pulling down the Soren government.

He said that he has been in politics for the last almost four decades but has never seen such blatant misuse of the government agencies.

The agency, since 2022, has been probing a trail of Rs 100 crore of ""proceeds of crime"" generated from illegal mining operations in the state.

The money laundering probe began after the ED raided Pankaj Mishra, one of the political aides of Soren, and his alleged associates in July 2022 and covered 19 locations in Sahibganj, Barhet, Rajmahal, Mirza Chauki and Barharwa in Jharkhand to investigate alleged irregularities in the operation of toll plaza tenders and instances of illegal mining in the state.

The evidence collected during the course of the investigation, including the statements of various persons, digital evidence and documents, revealed that the funds seized from the accused was derived from illegal mining being rampantly done in the Sahibganj area, including the forest area, the ED had said.

The situation around the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, a crucial shipping route connecting the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean, has escalated due to recent attacks by Yemen-based Houthi militants.

Asked will the Red sea developments have any impact on India's maritime trade, he said, ""no impact"".

The strait, vital for 30 per cent of global container traffic, has seen increased tensions with various incidents in 2023, including attacks and military manoeuvres by regional and global powers.

The AAP leader in a letter to the ED has urged the central agency to respond to his earlier responses and ""clarify the position"" so that he can ""understand the real intent, ambit, nature, sweep and scope of the purported inquiry/investigation for which he is being called.

He has sought a questionnaire from the agency and also questioned the intent of the summons served to him. He also mentions in the letter that the Rajya Sabha elections are to take place on January 19 and he also has to participate in the Republic Day programme on January 26 as Delhi CM.

The Aam Aadmi Party asserted that Kejriwal was ready to cooperate with the agency but claimed that the summons was sent with the intention of arresting him. ""Why has the notice been sent right before elections? The notice is an attempt to stop Kejriwal from campaigning in elections,"" the party alleged.

Kejriwal was summoned on Wednesday for questioning. This was the third ED notice to Kejriwal, also the AAP's convener, after he refused to appear before the federal agency on two earlier summonses for November 2 and December 21.

Opposition BJP said that Kejriwal is ""shaking in fear"" and not appearing before the Enforcement Directorate because he knows that he is the ""kingpin"" of the alleged liquor policy scam. BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said, ""Outright dishonest and sinister Arvind Kejriwal is shaking in fear and making one after another lame excuse to skip ED summons.""

Here is full text of Kejriwal's letter to ED, addressed to assistant director Jogendar
1. It is a matter of concern that despite my comprehensive response(s) bringing to your notice critical dimensions and legal objections involved in issuing summons to me to appear 'in person' in your purported exercise of powers under Section 50 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA'), you have chosen not to respond. Therefore, I once again reiterate the following aspects which are the core of my earlier responses:-

Objections in response dated 02.11.2023
a. Summons are motivated and issued for vexatious considerations;
b. From summons, it is not clear as to the capacity in which I am being summoned i.e. as a witness or a suspect in the above-mentioned
case;
c. Summons fail to provide details in relation to the File bearing F. No. ECIR/HIUII/14/2022 or the reason why I have been summoned therein, or any details thereof;
d. Summons appear to be in the nature of fishing and roving enquiry as it does not specify whether I am being summoned as an individual or in my official capacity as Chief Minister of Delhi or as National Convenor of AAP.

Objections in response dated 20.12.2023
a. It is not discernible as to how, why and under what circumstances has your office sought my appearance only in person when the Act itself provides for appearance through authorised agents. What is the compelling necessity that your office has chosen to call me in person without specifying any reason or necessity thereof?
b. In the summons, the column of 'Schedule' and 'As per Annexure enclosed' are struck off with pen and there is absolutely nothing mentioned in the summons as to whether any particular information, material or document is required from me.
c. It is also not forthcoming as whether to I am being called as a representative of the political party (Aam Aadmi Party) whereof, I am the National Convenor. I am advised that a Political Party may not even be covered within the purview of the Prevention Money Laundering Act, 2002 at all. Any such impression that Enforcement Directorate may have gathered about the Political Party falling in the category of 'artificial juridical person' is palpably wrong and cannot qualify the test of legality.
d. Similar notices without any specific details, have been held illegal and quashed by courts.

2) I am surprised that you have once again sent identically worded summons in the same format as before without giving any response to my earlier replies dated 02.11.2023 &20.12.2023.Therefore, I assume that you do not have any valid reason or justification for issuance of these summons.

3) Your silence on the aforementioned critical aspects leads me to infer that you are maintaining unwarranted secrecy and are being opaque and arbitrary in the present matter.

4) In my earlier responses and now again, I reiterate my firm commitment to the rule of law and my unflinching undertaking to render any co-operation or assistance in any inquiry or investigations that may be as per law, fair, just and expedient. However, as stated above, your silence confirms my apprehensions about certain vested interests and extraneous as well as malafide considerations prevailing over any objective, rational, fair or impartial inquiry or investigations.

5) I am in know of several cases where the Directorate of Enforcement has given a detailed explanation and/or response to any of the queries raised or apprehensions nursed by a person who may have been issued summons under Section 50 PMLA but in my case, you have refused to even acknowledge the receipt of the detailed submissions made in response to the summons issued to me.

6) As a premier investigating agency of the country, the 'non-disclosure' and 'non-response' approach adopted by you cannot sustain the test of law, equity or justice. Your obstinacy tantamounts to assuming the role of judge, jury and executioner at the same time which is not acceptable in our country governed by the rule of law.

7) In these circumstances, I therefore once again, urge you to kindly respond to my earlier responses and clarify the position so as to enable me to understand the real intent, ambit, nature, sweep and scope of the purported inquiry/investigation for which I am being called.

8) Every time, before the summons reaches me, it is already there in media. This raises questions whether the purpose of the summon is to do any legitimate enquiry or tarnish my reputation.

9) Be that as it may, please note that the Election Commission of India has since decided to hold the Elections to the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) inter alia, from National Capital Territory of Delhi. Nominations start from 3rd January. Voting will take place on 19th January and results will be declared. The National Capital Territory of Delhi has been allocated 3 seats in the Rajya Sabha and the terms of office of the present incumbents will expire on 27th January, 2024.Therefore, the said elections are being held to fill the above-mentioned vacancies. Being National Convenor of the Aam Aadmi Party, I am held up in the process and run up to these critical elections.

10) Being the Chief Minister of Delhi, I am also quite occupied in planning and preparations for several programmes and functions for the Republic Day i.e., 26th January, 2024.

11) In such circumstances, I hope that you shall act as per law by transparently and fairly, considering my objections as raised and indicated in my earlier responses dated 02.11.2023 and 20.12.2023.

12) In the meanwhile, I would be happy to respond to any questionnaire if you seek any information/documents, which are in my knowledge/possession.

Thanking You,
(ARVIND KEJRIWAL)

Khan, 71, is the founding chairman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) and Chaudhry, a senior former member of his party.

The two leaders were booked in 2022 for using foul language against the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja.

A four-member panel of the ECP conducted the proceedings at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where both Khan and Chaudhry have been incarcerated in different cases.

The two leaders were indicted on the charges of insulting the electoral body and the chief election commissioner. Both were present in the courtroom when the charges were read and they denied the allegations mentioned in the charge sheet.

After the indictment, the panel adjourned the hearing on the contempt case till January 16.

The indictment comes after several delays in the case which was first being heard in the ECP building but the police refused to present Khan for indictment due to security reasons, forcing the commission on December 6 to shift the hearing to the Adiala Jail.

Khan was ousted through a vote of no-confidence in April 2022. More than 150 cases have been registered against him since his ouster from power.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/indias-wheat-output-may-touch-new-record-fy24-provided-normal-temperature/articleshow/106516553.cms,"New Delhi, Wheat production is expected to touch a new record of 114 million tonnes in the ongoing 2023-34 crop year on higher coverage and provided weather conditions remain normal, a top food ministry official said on Wednesday. The last leg of sowing of wheat, the main rabi (winter) crop, is underway and will continue till next week. Till last week, wheat was planted in 320.54 lakh hectares, as per the official data.

Wheat production stood at a record 110.55 million tonnes in the 2022-23 crop year (July-June), compared to 107.7 million tonnes achieved in the previous year.

""We expect that total area under cultivation of wheat will increase this year and God willingly if the climate is alright the production will be 114 million tonne that's what the agriculture ministry has indicated informally to us,"" Food Corporation of India (FCI) Chairman and Managing Director Ashok K Meena told reporters.

Area sown to wheat crop is also showing an increase compared to the last year. There was a deficit of one per cent in some states but that will also be made up in the first week of January, he said.

""If that is the level of production, we are very confident that we will be able to procure more than our requirement and also additional stocks needed for the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS) for next year,"" he noted.

When asked if the central nodal agency plans to step up procurement considering the opening wheat balance of 76 lakh tonnes to be on April 1, which is just enough to meet the buffer requirement, the FCI chief said: ""We will try our best to provide minimum support price to all farmers. Because of the open market sale, the indications are prices have stabilised and are not higher than it was last year.

""Since the wheat MSP is higher by 7 per cent than the last year, we hope that lot of farmers will be willing to give their produce to the FCI,"" Meena said.

Last year, the FCI's wheat procurement stood at 26.2 million tonnes, higher than the annual buffer requirement of 18.4 million tonnes.

This year's wheat crop will be ready for harvest from April onwards.

FCI is the central nodal agency that buys rice and wheat to ensure MSP to the farmers and distributes the same for free to 81 crore poor via ration shops. It also uses surplus grain via OMSS to boost domestic availability and check prices.

Last year, the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways in a statement said the project is expected to be completed with an investment of Rs 41,000 crore (USD 5 billion), including investment from both government and public-private partnership (PPP) concessionaires.

""11 players have submitted expressions of interest for the international transhipment port project at Great Nicobar Island,"" the ports, shipping and waterways minister said.

The EOI was sought on January 28, 2022.

The proposed port in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands will have the ultimate capacity to handle 16 million containers per year, and in the first phase, to be commissioned by 2028 at a cost of Rs 18,000 crore, it will handle more than 4 million containers.

Other projects planned around the transhipment port include an airport, a township and a power plant.

The project is located on the international trade route, with existing transhipment terminals like Singapore, Klang and Colombo in proximity.

The project focuses on three key drivers, which can result in making it a leading container transhipment port -- strategic location in terms of proximity (40 nautical miles) with the international shipping trade route, availability of natural water depth of over 20m and carrying capacity of transhipment cargo from all the ports in the proximity, including Indian ports, as per the statement.

The proposed facility is envisaged to be developed in four phases.

The estimated cost for Phase 1 of the proposed transhipment port is around Rs 18,000 crore, which includes the construction of breakwaters, dredging, reclamation, berths, storage areas, building and utilities, procurement and installation of equipment and development of the port colony, with core infrastructure going to be developed with the government support.

Public-private partnership (PPP) will be encouraged for this project via landlord mode. The PPP concessionaire will have the flexibility to develop a storage area, container handling equipment and other infrastructure based on the concessionaire's own market and business assessment, subject to the minimum guaranteed traffic.

The concessionaire would be awarded a long-term PPP concession of 30 to 50 years (based on requirement), will be responsible for the provision(s) of port services and shall have the rights to levy, collect and retain charges from port users.

Currently, nearly 75 per cent of India's transhipped cargo is handled at ports outside India.

Colombo, Singapore and Klang handle more than 85 per cent of this cargo, with more than half of it handled at Colombo port.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/berlin-spinoff-or-prequel-of-money-heist-how-is-it-connected-to-netflix-show/articleshow/106516708.cms,"Netflix has recently released a new series named ""Berlin,"" which is connected with the 'Money Heist universe'. It has sparked a debate regarding its classification as a spinoff or a prequel. The show was originally aired on Antena 3 in 2017, it has now swiftly landed on Netflix shortly after the conclusion of Money Heist's first part. Netflix secured the rights to the series, after the end of Part 2. 'Money Heist', a Spanish crime drama spanning five seasons, revolved around characters orchestrating intricate heists. Two years after the original series came to an end, Berlin, one of the standout characters from Money Heist, now has a series dedicated to him.

No linear narrative

Spanned over five seasons, Money Heist didn’t adhere to a linear narrative, particularly evident in Berlin's storyline. Although the character met his demise in Part 2 of Money Heist, flashbacks allowed his presence to persist in the show. Berlin became the focal point of the first spinoff in the crime series because he is immense popularity. It premiered as an eight-part drama titled ""Berlin"" on Netflix on December 29. Though it did not replicate the intense suspense of its predecessor, Berlin embarked on an engaging new journey with a fresh team.


Both spinoff and prequel

""Berlin"" serves as both a spinoff and a prequel to Money Heist, showing the titular character's adventures before the events of the original series. It explores the backstory of Andres de Fonollosa, known as Berlin, portrayed by Pedro Alonso, reprising his role from the original series. Set during Berlin's ""golden age,"" the series unfolds years before the heists depicted in Money Heist, but also before Berlin's diagnosis with Helmer’s Myopathy, a degenerative condition in the original show.

Berlin shared a close relationship with his half-brother, The Professor (Alvaro Morte) in Money Heist. But the latter does not appear in the new series. The events in ""Berlin"" occur before the timelines of Money Heist seasons 1 and 2, showcasing Berlin's attempt to steal €44 million worth of jewels in Paris, France, alongside a brand-new team. While the central figures from the original show aren’t featured in the prequel, Raquel Murillo (Itziar Ituño) and Alicia Sierra (Najwa Nimri) reprise their roles as guest stars.

'Berlin' integrates into 'Money Heist'

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/ongc-wins-7-reliance-bp-one-oil-gas-blocks-in-latest-bid-round/articleshow/106517137.cms,"State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) won seven areas for exploration of oil and gas while a consortium of Reliance Industries Ltd and BP Plc walked away with one in the latest bid round. Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said 10 blocks for exploration and production of oil and gas were offered in the eighth round of Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP-VIII).

Contracts for the 10 blocks were signed on Wednesday morning, he said.

Of the 10 blocks offered, ONGC won seven while Reliance-BP, Oil India Ltd and Sun Petrochemicals Pvt Ltd got one area each.

Parallelly, three coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks too were awarded and the ninth round of OALP was launched for bidding.

""Estimated investments in awarded blocks for a committed exploration work programme is to the tune of USD 233 million,"" an official note said.

India had offered 10 blocks for bidding in the eighth round of the OALP in July 2022. After extending the bid deadline a few times, the round closed in July 2023.

Five companies -- ONGC, Vedanta Ltd, Oil India Ltd (OIL), Sun Petrochemicals Pvt Ltd and Reliance-BP Exploration (Alpha) Ltd -- put in 13 bids for the 10 blocks on offer in OALP-VIII, according to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).

Seven of the 10 blocks on offer received single bids and the other three blocks had two bidders each. Global energy giants like ExxonMobil, Chevron and TotalEnergies, which India has been courting to give a fillip to exploration and production, did not put in any bid.

ONGC was the sole bidder for six blocks while Reliance-BP was the sole bidder for the ultradeep sea block in Krishna Godavari basin, according to the DGH.

In all, ONGC bid for nine out of the 10 blocks. It did not bid for the block bid by Reliance-BP. ONGC won seven out of the nine blocks it had bid.

Reliance and BP have more than a decade-old partnership and had won a block in one of the previous OALP rounds.

The government has been hoping that opening up more acreage for exploration will help boost India's oil and gas production, helping cut down the USD 222 billion oil import bill.

In 2016, it brought in an open acreage policy which moved away from the previous practice of government identifying and bidding out blocks to one where explorers were allowed the freedom to identify any area outside of the ones that are already with some company or other, for prospecting of oil and gas.

The areas identified are to be clubbed twice a year and offered for bidding. The firm identifying the area gets a 5-point advantage.

But except for the first round, private sector participation has been scant. Mining mogul Anil Agarwal's Vedanta Ltd walked away with 41 blocks out of the 55 blocks on offer in the very first round and got another 10 areas in two subsequent rounds.

Other rounds have been dominated by state-owned firms.

""A momentous occasion in India's quest towards expanding and strengthening oil exploration & production footprint which will significantly accelerate our journey towards energy self-sufficiency,"" Puri said on the OALP-VIII contract signing. ""The steps that the government has taken in the energy sector in the last two years will play a key role in reducing our dependence on energy imports.""

He said an OALP-IX bid round has been launched.

""Contracts signed for 3 Coal Bed Methane Blocks awarded under Special CBM Bid Round- 2022,"" he said.

Under the OALP VIII bid round, a total of 10 blocks were offered for bidding comprising an area of 34,364 square kilometres, spread across 9 sedimentary basins and included 2 onland blocks, 4 shallow water blocks, 2 deep water blocks and 2 ultra deep-water blocks, he said.

Under Special CBM Round-2022, 16 CBM blocks spread over 5,817 square kilometres in seven states were offered for bidding. ""Estimated investments in awarded blocks for a committed exploration work programme is to the tune of USD 7.4 million,"" he said.

As a major reform in the E & P sector, the Hydrocarbon Exploration & Licensing Policy (HELP) was approved in March 2016. ""In continuation to its determination for the reduction in import dependency of oil & gas & accelerating E&P activities, policy reforms were notified in the upstream sector in February 2019 & again in May 2023 with a focus to shift from 'revenue' to 'production' maximisation. There is also continued focus on greater transparency & streamlined procedures,"" he said.

In continuation of its aggressive acceleration of E&P activities & adhering to the prescribed timelines, the government has now launched OALP -IX for international competitive bidding, he added.

In the last round, OALP-VII, ONGC walked away with three out of eight blocks on offer while OIL won two blocks and state-owned gas utility GAIL was awarded one block. Sun Petrochemicals Pvt Ltd won the remaining two blocks in the Cambay basin.

In OALP-VI, ONGC won 18 out of the 21 areas on offer. OIL walked away with two blocks and Sun Petrochemical got one block.

A new policy for finding and producing oil and gas called HELP was promulgated on March 30, 2016.

Since then, eight bid rounds of OALP have been concluded and 144 exploration and production blocks awarded. These blocks cover over 2.44 lakh square kilometres of area.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/reflecting-on-15-years-of-bitcoin-indias-crypto-evolution-and-beyond/articleshow/106516624.cms,"Happy Genesis Block Day! January 3, marks a monumental occasion in the realm of cryptocurrencies worldwide, i.e. the Bitcoin Genesis Day - signifying the inception of the pioneering cryptocurrency that reshaped the global financial landscape. ""As Bitcoin marks its 15th year, its resilience and transformative impact on the financial landscape cannot be overstated. From a disruptive concept to a billion-dollar asset, Bitcoin has survived and thrived, solidifying its position as a revolutionary force in finance,” said Edul Patel Co-founder and CEO of Mudrex while sharing his thoughts on the Bitcoin Genesis Day.

Today as Bitcoin celebrates its 15th anniversary, this auspicious day commemorates the genesis block, laying the foundation for Bitcoin's revolutionary journey, altering traditional notions of currency, and introducing a decentralised and secure financial paradigm to the world. This milestone not only signifies a decade and a half of Bitcoin's existence but also holds immense significance in delineating the trajectory of cryptocurrencies, especially regarding its impact on India's burgeoning crypto landscape.

The Genesis of Bitcoin
The inception of Bitcoin traces back to a mysterious figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto, who introduced this groundbreaking digital currency through a whitepaper titled ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" published in 2008. Nakamoto's vision centred on a decentralised financial system and the concepts elucidated in this document laid the foundation for a trustless, secure, and transparent financial network.

This innovative concept challenged traditional financial systems, offering an alternative that wasn't controlled by any central authority. Furthermore, even after all these years, Nakamoto's identity remains an enigma, adding a layer of fascination to Bitcoin's origins, which have since sparked a global movement in the domain of digital currencies and blockchain technology.

Tracing Bitcoin’s journey and its impact on Indian market
Tracing Bitcoin’s evolution within the Indian market unveils a narrative woven with intrigue, innovation, and persistent regulatory uncertainty. Bitcoin's arrival in India sparked the curiosity of tech enthusiasts and early adopters, drawing in a burgeoning community of enthusiasts and investors, leading to a rapid ascent of India’s crypto landscape. However, even as India’s crypto landscape swiftly gained momentum, regulatory ambiguity remained a matter of pivotal concern, fostering market fluctuations due to unclear government stances that affected investor sentiments and hindered industry growth.

However, amidst these regulatory fluctuations, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies emerged as pivotal tools for financial inclusion in India. They offered an alternate financial pathway for the vast Indian populace, enabling accessible funds and seamless transactions, ultimately empowering users nationwide. This surge in Bitcoin trading and investment activities led to the transformation of the Indian crypto sphere, catalysing the emergence of numerous platforms and exchanges to meet the escalating demand for cryptocurrencies. However, this burgeoning growth was accompanied by challenges, not limited to regulatory ambiguities but also encompassing matters such as security concerns and market volatility, significantly impacting investor confidence.

Nevertheless, the Indian crypto landscape displayed resilience and ingenuity. Indigenous startups ventured beyond cryptocurrencies, exploring blockchain's applications across diverse sectors such as supply chain management, healthcare, and governance. This visionary exploration highlights blockchain's broad utility beyond its initial financial applications. India's embrace of blockchain's multifaceted potential underscores its evolving stance and emphasises the immense possibilities for transformative technological integration.

Evolution of Cryptocurrency Policies: Shaping India's Crypto Landscape
The political landscape in India regarding crypto policies remains in a state of deliberation and flux, as regulatory focus intensifies within the global cryptocurrency sector. Anticipations linger over forthcoming regulatory introductions governing digital assets within the European Union slated for 2024, alongside the imminent influence of upcoming US and Indian elections on crypto policies, potentially reshaping taxation structures and regulatory frameworks. Despite current taxation norms in India, taxing crypto investments at 1% TDS and 30% on gains, expectations persist for prospective tax reductions, albeit uncertainties loom over potential changes in 2024.

Further exploring the future outlook of crypto in India, Edul Patel Co-founder and CEO of Mudrex stated “the recent wave of acceptance by governments and the institutions' gearing for Bitcoin spot ETFs underscores the growing mainstream recognition of this asset. Additionally, the anticipation surrounding the fourth Bitcoin halving this year adds another layer of intrigue, highlighting the inherent scarcity and deflationary nature that continue to fuel its appeal among investors and enthusiasts alike. As we witness these significant milestones, it becomes increasingly clear that Bitcoin's journey is not just a chapter in financial history but an ongoing saga reshaping the future of money.""

Envisioning the crypto landscape in 2024, Indian enthusiasts anticipate measures integrating Web3 and blockchain into the nation's digitisation thrust rather than solely banking on reduced taxation policies. As India took the lead among G20 nations in framing a global crypto framework in 2023, the country's budget presentations pre and post-elections may signify its domestic legislative priorities.

Ajeet Khurana, Founder of Reflexical Pte Ltd, while sharing insights on cryptocurrency regulations, highlighted Bitcoin's distinct position as less susceptible to regulatory interventions due to its clean inception compared to other crypto assets used for fundraising purposes. He emphasised Bitcoin's revolutionary leap in democratising money within the technological landscape. However, concerns persist over the centralised ventures of the wealthiest individuals within this decentralised paradigm, reflecting the dichotomy within the crypto space.

Regulatory clarity remains pivotal to unlock innovation and investments in India's crypto space, especially with recent regulatory developments like the notice from India's FIU targeting offshore crypto entities. This shift underscores the need for compliant platforms to ensure user protection and legal recourse, shaping India's crypto regulations significantly. Looking ahead, regulatory clarity stands as the cornerstone for unlocking the transformative potential of blockchain's integration across sectors like agriculture and finance, promising substantial socio-economic impacts in India.

Future Outlook: Bitcoin's Evolution in 2024
In 2024, Bitcoin is poised for transformative growth amid surging institutional interest and regulatory advancements. Expectations abound for increased adoption by traditional financial institutions, propelled by improved regulatory clarity, positioning Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Technological enhancements addressing scalability issues and environmental concerns, coupled with a push for DeFi integration and privacy upgrades, anticipate a more versatile and sustainable Bitcoin ecosystem. Anticipated regulatory guidelines in India, the rise of tokenized assets, and the potential proliferation of Bitcoin ETFs signal a significant shift in the cryptocurrency landscape, underscoring 2024 as a pivotal year for Bitcoin's consolidation and integration into the global financial sphere.

Sharing his insights on the Web3 Tech Outlook, Neeraj Khandelwal, Cofounder of CoinDCX & Okto said, “As we enter 2024, Web3 tech trends project a bullish market, driven by innovations like L2 and ZK proofs. Mainstream adoption is expected to increase with the introduction of user-friendly Web3 wallets seamlessly embedded in users' favourite apps. In 2024, gaming is poised to lead dApp activities with a remarkable 15% monthly growth. NFTs are set to transition from novelty to a $15.46 billion utility by 2027. Social dApps surge by 72%, competing with industry giants. We can anticipate a Self-Sovereign Identity revolution, further underscoring the industry's trajectory towards a user-centric, privacy-focused future. Layer 2 solutions revolutionise scalability, and real-world asset tokenization thrives. In this pivotal year, the combination of user-friendly Web3 wallets and the anticipated approval of a Bitcoin ETF signals widespread adoption of Web3 technologies. As the digital landscape reshapes, expect Web3 to not only redefine our online experiences but also usher in an era of secure healthcare platforms, tamper-proof voting systems, and decentralised social networks.""

In conclusion, as Bitcoin Genesis Day unfurls annually, it stands as a poignant reminder of the extraordinary trajectory of cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin, and their profound impact on India's financial terrain. Despite the hurdles that may emerge along the way, the prospects for growth, innovation, and financial inclusivity remain vast. For India to chart its course effectively in the realm of crypto, nurturing conversations, promoting education, and establishing an enabling regulatory framework will be pivotal in unlocking the complete potential of this transformative technology."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/gold-loans-help-nbfcs-hold-their-own-against-traditional-banks/articleshow/106517229.cms,"Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) focusing on gold loans have maintained a reasonably resilient market share despite intense competition from banks, according to CRISIL Ratings.

That, and support from strong capitalisation, sharp focus on risk management and healthy profitability has meant their credit profiles continue to be stable.Growth in the assets under management (AUM) of gold-loan NBFCs has been driven by three factors: ability to hold on to their customers — as evinced in a steady base; focus on small and mid-size loans; and increasing reach by expanding branch networks.These trends have meant the market share of gold-loan NBFCs has been resilient at over 60% between March 2021 to September 2023 despite strong competition from banks.

While NBFCs are known for their servicing agility, banks have focused on borrowers seeking bigger and competitive interest rates. On their part, banks have sharpened focus on non-agricultural loans for personal use, particularly in the Rs 3 lakh and above ticket sizes, over the past 3 years. On the other hand, NBFCs have adopted steps to sustain growth rate and market share. In the first half of this fiscal, NBFCs matched banks by growing at 10-11% (non-annualised).

Says Malvika Bhotika, Director, CRISIL Ratings, “Gold-loan NBFCs have bolstered clientele and managed growth by opening branches in new geographies, offering online gold loans and door-step services, and deploying marketing strategies to target inactive customers.”

Growth for gold-loan NBFCs remains highly influenced by change in the prices of the precious metal. In fiscal 2023, gold prices rose 10%, with loan books rising in tandem, supported by bigger ticket sizes. Similar was the trend in this fiscal first half, with prices rising 13% while AUM of gold-loan NBFCs grew 10% sequentially.From an asset quality perspective, holding timely auctions has kept the credit cost — the apt gauge of gold-loan asset quality — in check, at 0.2-0.4% historically (including in the pandemic-impacted fiscal 2022).

Last fiscal, the credit cost was 0.3%.The discipline on loan-to-value (LTV) and auctions remains high as gold-loan NBFCs maintain sharp focus on risk management. Average portfolio LTV has remained range-bound at 65-70% over the years.In terms of yields, there has been on an uptrend over the past two quarters. Yields had fallen in fiscal 2022 and the first half of fiscal 2023 as NBFCs looked to attract new customers with competitive pricing. However, with leading players largely discontinuing these schemes, yields have inched up again.

Lending spreads will continue to be over 10%, backed by the ability to pass on the rate increases to customers. And profitability, as measured by return on managed assets, is expected to remain comfortable in the range of 3.5-5% for large gold-loan NBFCs.

Says Prashant Mane, Associate Director, CRISIL Ratings, “The healthy profitability, leading to robust internal accrual, will continue to support growth without the need for any external equity infusion. Consequently, gearing levels are expected to remain comfortable at less than 3 times over the medium term.”"

Earlier this week, the company had appointed three companies, including noted architect Hafeez Contractor, as city planners to present a draft development plan for the Asia's largest slum cluster.

When asked about the media reports that the company was about to reach financial closure for the project with two lenders agreeing to fund it, a source in the know said the tender conditions are very clear, we cannot raise any debt to fund the project. We will dip into our own finances and look at other innovative financial instruments. But currently we haven't reached a stage where we've to tap the markets to raise funds.

Sources further said the group has envisaged the project with a human centric approach, taking into consideration the flourishing businesses and entrepreneurs of Dharavi.

The objective is to not only safeguard the livelihoods of the residents of the area but also to enhance their skills. Towards this they will be setting up a skill development centre, which will have special focus on women and the youth, to all the citizens of the area, prepare them for a better future, the source said.

NPCI operates the UPI service along with other payment processing infrastructure.

For December 2023, UPI payments in the country touched 12.02 billion transactions with payments worth Rs 18.23 lakh crore being processed by the service during the month. This represented a 54% year-on-year growth in terms of volume and a 42% growth in transaction value annually.

Total transactions processed by UPI in 2023 stood at 117.6 billion. Further, the UPI rails also witnessed a little over Rs 182 lakh crore in total value being processed through the payments infrastructure last year, data showed.

This shows a staggering growth for UPI payments service in the country which recorded around 74 billion transactions in 2022 and 38.7 billion transactions in 2021.

Further, monthly transactions on UPI have seen an over 49% jump, between January to December, last year, data from NPCI showed.

Last month, ET had also reported that UPI Autopay, the recurring payment mandate run by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) on the UPI payment mode, has also been steadily gaining steam, especially for bill and subscription payments in the country.

The rising popularity of UPI Autopay could also be attributed to the increase in the number of use cases for which the service could be used. This included mutual fund payments, insurance premiums and credit card bill payments in the country.

Further, recent enhancements of transaction limits to Rs 1 lakh from Rs 15,000 previously has also led to the growth of the UPI Autopay feature, both in terms of volumes and value."

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/shilpa-bhaskar-gole-on-financial-goals-and-what-gen-z-needs-to-learn/articleshow/106504478.cms,"Shilpa Bhaskar Gole, NerdyBird Financial Wellness, says “Gen Z-ers should be committed to their financial independence. A lot of them are very reluctant to fly out of their parents’ nest, even if they are earning. I would say get out of your parents’ nest and try and assert your financial independence early on. That will give you a real sense of what to prioritise when it comes to your money and what are those things that you do not need your money for more than others.”

Before I ask you which are the top five goals that one should set as financial goals for 2024, can you explain what are financial goals? There is a lot of interest by the Gen-Zs and the new people coming into the markets.
Shilpa Bhaskar Gole: I think this is a very, very important question that I get and not just from Gen Z, but also from millennials and everyone. Why this question is so important with the year beginning is because we are seeing crazy valuations right now and the stock markets are at a high. People do not know what to be doing at this very uncertain phase where things look really positive in terms of a bull run in the market. At the same time, there are a lot of people who have not started investing and who do not want to miss out on those gains. So, yes, a lot of questions are coming around about where to invest our money and what should we be doing at this point.

When I speak to people, they are very cheerful about the rally that we have seen in the markets. At this point in time, we feel that there is a need for people to start investing in a calibrated manner so that over the years they could compound their wealth. For 2024, given the market dynamics, given the kind of returns that equity markets, gold as well as people bonds are giving, what are the top five financial goals that will be on the priority list?
Shilpa Bhaskar Gole: I would say, forget investing for a moment. It sounds very counterintuitive. I would say your first financial goal needs to be to do the financial goal setting exercise. I would say the first thing that you need to do is to set yourself a plan. This plan needs to talk about three things particularly; one is what are your short term goals? What do you want to be doing with your money in the next five years? What are those intermediate or medium term goals that you have in mind? What do you want to accomplish within a 5-10 year horizon?

What is it that is something long term that is there in your goals? I think the answer to this would come from also visualizing what your ideal life is. It does go into the psychology of money. I very much believe that the first exercise that we need to do before getting into investing is to do that goal-setting exercise and coming up with that plan where you talk about your short term, medium term and your long term goals.

Now, once you are done with that, you can start to think about where to put that money, where you should be investing your money. The first thing that you would do even before investing is to create a protective buffer around your money. So make sure that that protective buffer is there because once you start growing your money and once you get into all this investment activity, the last thing you want is a sudden unexpected event that comes your way and eats into your hard earned money and your investments.

I would say create that protective buffer. How are you going to build an emergency fund? If you do not already have an emergency fund in place, please start by making that your priority on your goal list. After you have got your plan in place and you have started building your emergency fund, the third thing to do is to ensure that you have got your health insurance policy in place. Whether you are from Gen Z or a millennial, if you are employed, chances are that your company is covering you.

But we all know that there is a lot of uncertainty when it comes to your company. If you decide to leave your job or lose your job, there would be a phase in between that is very uncertain and you do not want to be without health insurance in that phase. We have heard of huge hospitalisation expenses in 2022 and 2023, where we have heard inflation of medical expenses being almost at 14% per annum. This is something that I would say will help people set that foundation and create a protective buffer before they start investing.

Now that we have these three steps in place, I would say, okay, start your investing journey. And within that one goal, all of us should have our retirement goals. This is something that is very, very ignored and overlooked, because we all believe only about thinking in the short term and maybe just the medium term.

It is very difficult for us to think that far away into the future. But we also live in a country now where we do not have access to financial security in our old age. So I would say, set that intention for yourself in 2024, to build a sizable retirement corpus for yourself. So even if you are just starting out with your job, make sure that that goal, at least, somewhere in your list of things to do and places to invest your money and create that fund for because that will just make sure that to reap the power of compounding and grow that money over a 20 to 30 year horizon.

So those are the big points that you should look for when setting your financial goals for 2024. But since we are getting to see a lot of interest from the Gen Z's as well, so any piece of advice that you have for them at this point in time, because these are those people who are literally starting their investing journey and planning to do so this particular year so what will be your advice to those people?
Shilpa Bhaskar Gole: I do not want to sound too prescriptive with Gen Z-ers. But they should be committed to their financial independence. A lot of them are very reluctant to fly out of their parents’ nest, even if they are earning. I would say get out of your parents’ nest and try and assert your financial independence early on. That will give you a real sense of what to prioritise when it comes to your money and what are those things that you do not need your money for more than others.

When you are living in your own home, it is very difficult for you to understand all that it takes into sustaining your current lifestyle as well as putting something aside for the future. So that would be my number one advice to them.

The second thing that I would definitely invite them to do is to start learning about money. And by learning, I say that when they are starting to invest, there may burn their fingers along the way, which I think is perfectly okay. So go ahead and start your learning process, attend courses, talk to experts, see what is going on in the money industry and find out what are those places where you can be investing and growing your money.

In order to do that, you have got to invest a little into learning and finding out what these things are. So that would be my second piece of advice to them.

Thirdly, I would say start investing. And like you very rightly said, I think it is very important that they start setting aside money because the earlier you start, the higher the chances are that your money will compound over two decades and three decades. So start with whatever you have, I am not going to give you rules of thumb about how much to set aside.

But if we can at least put aside 10% of your earnings every month and start investing them into equity, I would say because we are talking about the long term here, and we are talking about beating inflation, start to understand what high quality equity is all about, and what it takes to put your money into those long term investments, and grow them with time.

This is a time when you will burn your fingers; you will find certain things are not working for you. But this is a great place for you to make those mistakes. That is something I would highly recommend to them.

Finally, do not get swayed by what your friends are doing. Gen Z is also highly, highly vulnerable to the world of social media, which is constantly pressurising them to travel abroad to do all those beautiful things, visit all those expensive, fine dining restaurants. I would invite Gen Z to understand their own values. I think the earlier we get that awareness about who we are and what we value, then the chances become lesser that we compare with our peers.

Some of us learn those lessons very late in life. But the earlier they start to understand that and not take everything on social media very seriously, the higher the chances are that they will spend mindfully. So from a spending point of view, I would highly recommend that they do what they believe matters most to them.

Keeping 2024 in view, what are the must-avoids for anybody, which could ensure that in the long run, they emerge as winners?
Shilpa Bhaskar Gole: When it comes to things that you should not be doing, when we are in this kind of a rally, my biggest invitation would be to stay put, stay invested, if it is about rebalancing your portfolio, sure go ahead and reduce your allocation to equity. If it is really going overboard, say for example, if you thought that you want to go with a 80-20 ratio, where 80% is an equity, and now with the bull run, you find that it is almost coming to 90%, then sure enough, this is a time for you to redeem a certain part of your equity investment and bring back the asset allocation to a balance.

But having said that, a lot of people are just starting out on their equity journey, and they may not really be ready for rebalancing. It is more of a place where they need to be increasing their equity allocation. So think of all your equity investments from a long term perspective, think of it as a way of beating inflation and growing your money over a 10 year period or more.

The moment you start thinking like that your equity portfolio starts to get allocated or mapped to goals that are all long term in nature. And the moment you are thinking long term, you can start to believe that you do not have to redeem all this money just because the markets are rallying right now. Stay put, stay invested.

Unless you have certain funds at this point in time, which you really want to remove from your portfolio, and they have been poor performers in the past, I think it is a good time for you to clean up your portfolio a bit. But otherwise, stay put. That would be the first thing: do not redeem your investments.

The second thing is definitely not to spend mindlessly. As much as you can, please look at your expenses and make sure that you are aligning yourself with your values when you are spending. And I think the third thing is not having a plan. Everyone should definitely have a plan going into 2024 about what they want to be doing with their money."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/normalcy-to-resume-within-a-day-or-two-as-truck-drivers-return-to-work-aimtc/articleshow/106515012.cms,"New Delhi: Truck drivers who had gone on strike to protest against the new stringent law on hit-and-run cases are gradually returning to work, and normalcy is expected to resume in a day or two, according to the All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), the truckers' body.

AIMTC statement came a day after the Centre assured truck drivers that the law will be implemented after consultations with AIMTC.

Following the assurances, AIMTC had on Tuesday appealed to the protesting truck drivers to end their strike after receiving assurance from the government that the decision to impose harsh penalties for hit-and-run cases under the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS) would be made after consulting with the truckers' body.

Representatives of AIMTC met Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla on Tuesday to discuss the issue of stringent provisions for hit-and-run cases.

AIMTC General Secretary N K Gupta stated, ""We had not called for a strike... striking drivers are now returning to work, and normal operations will be restored within one or two days."" Gupta further assured the drivers that they need not worry and should contribute to the growth of the economy by joining work.

The three-day strike by truck, bus, and tanker operators began on Monday in several states to protest against the ""stringent punishments"" as outlined in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. Under this new law, which is set to replace the Indian Penal Code, drivers who cause serious road accidents due to negligent driving and flee the scene without informing the authorities may face up to 10 years in prison or a fine of Rs 7 lakh. Previously, the punishment for such cases under the British-era Indian Penal Code (IPC) was two years.

On Tuesday, long queues of motorists were observed in many parts of Punjab and a few areas of Haryana due to concerns that supplies would soon run out as a result of the truckers' strike. However, the situation at petrol pumps in Punjab is gradually returning to normal on Wednesday as fresh stocks are being replenished.

This will likely be up by 5.2% versus Rs 10,883 crore reported by the company in the year-ago period, according to estimates by Elara Capital.

PAT growth will likely be lower this time as against a 10.98% YoY increase the company reported during the December quarter last fiscal.

On a sequential basis, the net profit is expected to grow 0.6%, as higher-than-usual furloughs are set to offset growth in Q3FY24, the brokerage added.

The brokerage also anticipates a 1% constant currency (CC) revenue dip on a quarter-on-quarter basis on account of lower working days, a slowdown in discretionary projects/North American business taking a hit in the said quarter. In dollar terms, TCS' revenue is expected to be $7,137.9 million, the report said. On a YoY basis, this is a 0.9% growth over the December quarter of the previous financial year.

Among segments, BFSI is expected to remain flat while growth in energy, life sciences and manufacturing verticals is reckoned.

The earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), which is a measure of the company's profitability, is estimated at Rs 14,596.80 crore, up 2.2% YoY and 0.8% QoQ, the note said.

Meanwhile, the EBIT margin will likely remain flat on a YoY basis while seeing an uptick of 30 bps in sequential terms. ""We expect the margin to expand by 30 bps due to lower subcontracting and pyramid rationalisation,"" Elara said.

The earnings per share (EPS) is seen to increase by 5.2% YoY and 0.6% sequentially to Rs 31.

For Elara, the key metrics to monitor are growth visibility in ER&D and product business, large deal wins around cost optimisation. Investors should also watch out for developments in BFSI and communication verticals which remain pain points according to this brokerage.

The other important monitorables include deal closure, ramp-up in deal wins, and updates on collaboration with AWS on genAl, the brokerage said.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/invest/how-to-save-rs-1-crore-quickly-use-this-8-4-3-rule-of-compounding/articleshow/105615421.cms,"Have you ever wondered how long it takes to accumulate Rs 1 crore? It will depend on how much you invest and how much return you get on your investment. But it is not as difficult as you think it is. With a little discipline and the power of compounding, you can easily double or triple your savings in the long run

Let’s find out how compounding can help you become wealthier

While simple interest is calculated on the principal amount or the money you have invested, compound interest is calculated on the principal amount and the interest that you earn on that. Compounding is the process where you earn interest on already accumulated interest.

The 8-4-3 rule of compounding
You can simply follow the 8-4-3 rule of compounding to grow your money. Let's understand it with an example. For instance, if you invest a lump sum of Rs 21,250 every month in an instrument that earns 12% interest per annum and is compounded yearly, you will get your first Rs 33.37 lakh in eight years.

Here comes the magic of compounding. It will take only half the time, i.e., four years, for the next Rs 33 lakh. To save the third Rs 33.33 lakh, it will take you only three years. So, in 15 years, you can save Rs 1 crore.

At the end of the 21st year, you will save Rs 2.22 crore — it takes only six years to double your Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore.

By the time you reach the 22nd year, it will just take one year to accumulate Rs 33 lakh, thanks to compounding. Do keep in mind here we take annual compounding, that is interest is calculated once a year.

How this 8-4-3 rule of compounding rule works
Expected return
12%
Monthly SIP amount
Rs 21250
Corpus after 8 years
Rs 33.76 lakh
Corpus after next 4 years (Total 12 years)
Rs 66.24 lakh
Corpus after next 3 years (Total 15 years)
Rs 1.02 crore
Equity SIP is known to deliver good returns
The Sensex is a broad indicator of equity market returns. Any investment made through via mutual fund systematic investment plans (SIP) in Sensex TRI in the last five years would have given a return (XIRR) of 15.3%. The story does not change for long-term SIPs. The returns generated through SIPs of 10 years, 15 years and 20 years are 13.5%, 13.2% and 13.39%, respectively.

Also Read: 50 equity mutual funds offer over 15% in 10 years

Time of compounding may change with return
The higher return you get on your investment, the quicker it will grow. However, in case the return are lower, then the timing of compounding will be longer. For instance, if you invest in a fixed income instrument or a debt product your return may be lower. So, if you get a 7% interest per annum (compounded quarterly) in such a fixed income product you may need to invest a higher amount of Rs 22,000 per month and the time of compounding will also change accordingly. Your corpus will reach Rs 33.09 lakh in nine years. It will grow to Rs 69.89 lakh in the next six years. In the next four years, it will grow above Rs 1 crore.

Choose the frequency of compounding wisely while investing
While you invest your money, it is important to take note of the frequency of compounding, especially when dealing with fixed income investments. While many schemes offer annual compounding of interest there are schemes where interest is calculated more than once a year. For instance, if you invest in a bank FD, the interest is compounded quarterly.

Let us assume that the interest is compounded quarterly, that is four times a year. Then Rs 21,250 investment per month with 12% yearly returns, grows to Rs 34.14 lakh in five years. If it is compounded monthly, it grows to Rs 34.32 lakh in eight years. When you invest a larger sum of money, the frequency at which the interest is compounded will play a huge role in your returns. The more the frequency of compounding, the faster will be the growth of money.

Often, we fear that it will take a long time to save a lump-sum amount. And it is true that it takes a longer time to accumulate significant wealth during the initial years of investments. But start early and be at it. Starting early will give you the time to take advantage of compounding. The more time you have, the more returns you will get. And you have to invest every month without fail. As you can see here, once the magic of compounding comes into play, your money will grow in no time."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/indias-top-8-office-markets-record-second-best-annual-absorption-in-2023/articleshow/106513417.cms,"India’s top eight office property markets witnessed buoyancy in demand reflecting strong occupier activity emphasising on the inherent economic strength of the country and robust annual growth amongst the large economies of the world.

In 2023, total office transaction grew 15% to 59.6 million sq ft and this is historically the second-best year with the peak level achieved in the year 2019 of 60.6 million sq ft, showed a Knight Frank India report.

While the Indian economy has not been completely insulated from the economic turbulence, timely interventions by the central bank and the government have ensured that inflation has not spiralled out of control and the economy has stayed on the growth path allowing the office market to remain buoyant.

“India will continue to play up on its natural advantages which include excellent real estate, highly competitive rents, very strong talent pool and a consistently growing economy, making it a robust end-user market. These factors will catalyse for advancing further demand for office space,” said Shishir Baijal, CMD, Knight Frank India.

Occupier sentiments have improved steadily in 2023 with cumulative transaction volumes across the eight markets increasing progressively over the four quarters of the year.

“In 2023, India solidified its role as the provider of talent to the world. Occupancies rebounded, and the amended (SEZ) rules are expected to boost office space for GCCs, BFSI segment and large corporates. The outlook for 2024 is optimistic, emphasizing India's appeal to global companies for innovation, skilled talent, leadership development, and service excellence,” Alok Aggarwal, CEO, Brookfield India Real Estate Trust.

According to Baijal, the surge in flexible workspaces will play a pivotal role in fostering growth-oriented businesses in India. With these factors in play, the Indian office market is expected to reach new peaks in 2024.

Despite witnessing a decline of more than 14% on-year in office space transactions, owing to slowdown in demand from technology sector and a higher base year volume of 2022, Bengaluru has led the Indian office market with 12.5 million sq ft of transactions during the year.

Registering a growth of 92%, Chennai market turned the biggest outperformer with 10.8 million sq ft of office space transactions in 2023.

Office completions declined 13% to 42.9 million sq ft in 2023 as developers were largely focused on residential projects owing to the relatively steeper increase in sales volume and prices. However, Kolkata saw a significant increase of 332% in office space completion, followed by Mumbai and Chennai at 52% and 49% respectively.

Bengaluru and Chennai witnessed the highest new office supplies of 13.4 mn sq ft and 6.6 mn sq ft, respectively.

Rents firmed up across all markets over the course of the year. This is the third half-yearly period, July-December, when rents have either grown or remained stable across all markets.

Despite not having had its best year in terms of transaction volumes, rent growth has been strong in Bengaluru at 7% on account of limited supply for grade A space. Among the other large markets, rents in Mumbai, NCR and Chennai have grown at 4%, 2%, and 6%, respectively."

In December, the sales volume of electric two-wheelers (E2W) in India witnessed a 17% year-on-year increase.

According to data from the Vahan portal, the sales of electric two-wheelers in India surged to 728,054 units in the fiscal year 2022-23, more than double the figures from the previous year, which recorded 252,641 units. It's important to note that these figures exclude low-speed sales.

Source: Smev

In the current fiscal year (FY24) until December, the sales of high-speed electric two-wheelers in the country have surpassed the 640,000 mark.

In terms of market share, Ola Electric has significantly expanded its presence, reaching 33%, up from 21% in FY23. Notably, in FY22, Ola held only a 6% market share, while Hero Electric dominated with a massive 27% share.

Ola's increased market share can be attributed to its robust marketing campaign, 'December to Remember,' during which it offered substantial discounts and reduced prices, particularly cutting the S1X+ e-scooter prices by Rs 20,000 or 18%. Sales volume experienced a month-on-month decline in most states, except for Delhi, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh.

Meanwhile, TVS has also made significant strides, increasing its market share in the electric two-wheeler space from 11% to 20% compared to the previous fiscal year.

Ather and Bajaj secure the third and fourth positions with 11% and 10% market shares, respectively.

It is noteworthy that December saw a decline in E2W sales, with only 75,366 units sold, significantly less than the November figures (91,734). These sales figures did not reach the 100,000 mark achieved in May, before the government announced a subsidy cut on E2Ws under the FAME program.

The order was issued in 2019 and it came into effect from October last year.

These relaxations have been given after a detailed stakeholder consultation with the industry.

To resolve the issues faced by the industry due to the order, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) has introduced amendments.

According to a government notification, Hermetic Compressors of more than 7000 W (2 TR) capacity have been removed from the order for one year for the manufacturers of air conditioning and refrigeration equipment and related parts.

It has also exempted 200 numbers of goods or articles imported per year for the purpose of research and development by the manufacturers.

These imported goods and articles however will not be allowed to be sold in the market and should be disposed of as scrap.

""The OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) shall maintain a year-wise record of such goods or articles and furnish the same, if so desired by the Government,"" it said.

Exemption have also been given to 6,000 hermetic compressors and heat exchangers domestically manufactured or imported for maintenance and sales per year by each of the manufacturers.

This is ""subject to the condition that such manufacturers shall declare its old stock"" of hermetic compressors and heat exchangers, it added.

The DPIIT initially issued Air Conditioner and its related Parts, Hermetic Compressor and Temperature Sensing Controls (Quality Control) Order, 2019 on December 5, 2019.

The Temperature Sensing Controls were dropped from the list subsequently as requested by the industry due to practical difficulties.

The date of implementation of the QCO was extended three times keeping in view of difficulties faced by the AC manufacturers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, to align with the date of implementation of BEE energy table, non-availability of adequate testing labs, and inability of BIS to undertake in-person audits of foreign manufacturers due to restrictions on foreign travel.

""In response to resolve the issues faced by the Industry regarding the said QCO...DPIIT introduces amendments in the Quality Control Order vide E-Gazette notification dated 2nd January 2024 for the smoother implementation and Ease of doing business by providing certain relaxation/ exemptions,"" the department said.

The DPIIT is establishing a quality control regime in the country for the industrial sectors under its domain in association with the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), Industry and other stakeholders.

QCOs will not only improve the manufacturing quality standards in the country but also enhance the brand and value of 'Made in India' products.

These initiatives, coupled with development testing labs, product manuals, accreditation of test labs etc. shall aid in the development of a quality ecosystem in India.

Effective from the new year, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Finland has implemented new regulations impacting short-stay travelers requiring Schengen visas.

Travelers will now have to show a minimum of 50 euros for each day spent in Finland, marking an increase of 20 euros from the previous requirement. This 66% hike comes in response to escalating living costs, the ministry said.

A Schengen visa serves as an entry permit for short-term or temporary visits, granting individuals access to travel within the Schengen area, encompassing multiple European countries.

Along with the increased financial requirement, Finland has introduced a new proof of sponsorship or accommodation scheme. This initiative allows visa applicants to use the financial resources of their hosts in Finland to meet the stipulated funds requirement.

Under this arrangement, hosts are required to complete the sponsorship form, which the visa applicant must include along with the rest of the application. This provision aims to enhance the transparency and accountability of financial arrangements for those seeking short-term stays in Finland.

The Schengen area includes 23 of the 27 EU member countries, along with associated neighbors Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.

From March, Schengen visa holders can visit two more countries on their trip to Europe - Bulgaria and Romania.

Addressing a party meeting in Kolkata, Shah said it was the BJP's commitment to implement the CAA.

The TMC, led by Mamata Banerjee, has been opposing the CAA.

The promise of implementing the controversial CAA was a major poll plank of the BJP in the last Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in West Bengal. The saffron party's leaders consider it a plausible factor that led to the rise of the BJP in the state.

According to the manual of parliamentary procedures, the rules for any legislation should have been framed within six months of presidential assent or seek extension from the Committees on Subordinate Legislation in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.

Since 2020, the home ministry has been taking extension in regular interval from the parliamentary committees for framing the rules.

More than a hundred people lost their lives during the protests or police action after Parliament passed the law.

Meanwhile, in last two years, more than 30 district magistrates and home secretaries of nine states have been given powers to grant Indian citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians coming from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan under the Citizenship Act of 1955.

According to the annual report of the Ministry of Home Affairs for 2021-22, from April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, a total of 1,414 foreigners belonging to these non-Muslim minority communities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan were given Indian citizenship by registration or naturalization under the Citizenship Act, 1955.

The nine states where Indian citizenship by registration or naturalization is given under the Citizenship Act of 1955 to non-Muslim minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are Gujarat, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Maharashtra.

Authorities of none of the districts of Assam and West Bengal, where the issue is politically very sensitive, have been given the powers so far.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/harshvardhan-dole-on-his-top-picks-among-gcd-omc-and-power-stocks/articleshow/106512869.cms,"Harshvardhan Dole, Vice President, IIFL Securities, says “in the 2024 strategy note that we have published yesterday, BPCL is one of our top picks in the sector. We find the risk reward very favourable for the oil marketing companies in general, and BPCL and IOC are preferred stocks. We like HPCL but in terms of pecking order it is BP, IOC, and then HP.”


In the CGD space, yesterday as well, we saw all of those stocks spiking in the trading session and there have been a couple of positive news flow for Gujarat Gas, specifically the price high that Aramco suggested on propane is something that should be beneficial for them. What do you think are the tailwinds to watch out for the city gas distribution space?
Harshvardhan Dole: Essentially, when I look at the CGD space, I would not take one or two quarter view because this is a sector which has got multi-year tailwinds and these tailwinds are in the form of stable policy, favourable initiatives from the government in terms of gas supplies and most importantly ability to price these products freely in the markets, so that places these companies much favourably relative to the earlier past.

Having said that, I think these companies should be able to consistently grow their volumes at least at 7% to 8% for the next few years. That should be clubbed with at least a 2-3% margin expansion. This means combined operating leverage should play out and we should see a double-digit earnings growth for the next foreseeable period in time. So, in general, we like the space and as the noise on EVs, etc, dilutes and these companies consistently generate solid cash flows as well as earnings growth, the PE multiples will consistently hold on., IGL continues to be our top pick in the sector, followed by MGL and as of now Gujarat Gas is the least preferred stock in the sector.

All categories of PSUs put together, would it be right to assume that CGD companies are a relatively undervalued part of the overall PSU basket, so under-owned because the earnings have not gone great shakes? Can that mean revert in the next two-three years? We should not look at them quarter to quarter, but two, three, four years? Even the Oil Minister is saying, look at the 2030 targets and see how we overachieve them.
Harshvardhan Dole: Yes, if you were to look at these stocks, one of the reasons why they have not done well, is there was an uncertainty in terms of gas supplies. Also, a few states had promulgated policy in terms of electric vehicles for which there was uncertainty in terms of their near-term growth. But as these clouds get cleared and these companies consistently report earnings growth driven by volumes and margins, the multiples will only catch up because rarely do you get to see businesses which are of non-dilutive nature and yet growing and generating more than 20% ROEs and ROCEs with a solid free cash flow profile. As the investors gather confidence on their ability to grow, the re-rating will be gradual and more back-ended.

Oil marketing companies like HPCL, BPCL, IOCL in the last quarter of CY23 ran up between 40% and 70%. Now there is a raging debate whether there will be a cut in the retail fuel prices or not. What is the possibility of that and what is your view on the sector after the run-up?
Harshvardhan Dole: We like the downstream companies the most and we like them even over the city gas distribution companies simply because the payoffs are far far more attractive. For example, IOCL which is the most undervalued stock in the sector, is available at one time book. And even if you assume that fuel prices are cut eventually in FY25 and there is a normalisation of margins thereof, the dividend yield is in double digits.

So we are talking about the largest refiner and marketing company in India with a double digit dividend yield sometime in FY25. One cannot go wrong. Same is the case with BPCL. If we strip out the embedded value which is coming from Mozambique, Petronet LNG, and IGL, BPCL's core earnings are trading at only 6 to 6.5 times. In the history of BPCL, rarely have we seen this kind of valuation multiples. In fact, in the 2024 strategy note that we have published yesterday, BPCL is one of our top picks in the sector. We find the risk reward very favourable for the oil marketing companies in general, and BPCL and IOC are preferred stocks. We like HPCL but in terms of pecking order it is BP, IOC, and then HP.

What are your top picks among power generation companies, especially thermal side?
Harshvardhan Dole: The way the stocks have run up, it is tough to give a call based on what will happen in the next couple of quarters’ time. And therefore, when we are evaluating the sector, we are taking a slightly extended view and we are of the opinion that at least for the next few years, the industry fundamentals will be in favour of the generating and the essentially distribution companies.

Therefore, one must align the allocation more towards generation and distribution. From a pecking order perspective, we like NTPC the most, followed by distribution entities like Torrent Power and CESC. And then the usual suspects will follow, which is Power Grid etc. But NTPC continues to be a preferred stock.

Having said that, with the CERC's draft regulations around the corner, the stocks are awaiting a directional call from the regulator.

We are hoping that given the shift in fundamentals, the regulator will not take any adversely hawkish view and try and balance out the interest of the generator distribution companies in one go.

The company has already provided a sneak peek into the design and colour options of the upcoming earphones, abandoning the 'Pro' moniker this year. Despite the name change, these earphones are anticipated to succeed the OnePlus Buds Pro 2, which made their debut in January 2023.

Design & Other Specs

Adding to the excitement, tipster Digital Chat Station suggests that the OnePlus Buds 3 might offer a 3D surround sound experience and support LHDC 5.0. These earphones are expected to provide an impressive total battery life of up to 44 hours, with 33 hours of playback time along with the case.

While the initial launch is set for January 4 in China, a global launch has not been officially confirmed. However, there are speculations that the OnePlus Buds 3 might make their way to global markets, including India and Europe, later in the month, possibly alongside the OnePlus 12R on January 23.

Price Details
As the launch date approaches, a recent report from Allround-PC has shed light on the pricing details and key specifications of the OnePlus Buds 3. The earphones are expected to be priced at EUR 99 (approximately Rs. 9,000) and will be available in Clear Sea Blue and Space Grey color options.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/migrate/germany-is-about-to-make-life-much-easier-for-foreign-workers-in-2024/articleshow/106510416.cms,"Germany is set to implement several changes to its immigration policies in 2024, making it harder for asylum-seekers but adding new initiatives to attract skilled labour.

Reforms have been announced with an aim to make Germany more appealing for skilled labor. A points-based system, based on language proficiency and professional experience, will grant eligible immigrants a one-year visa to search for jobs.

The EU Blue Card will be expanded to cover sectors facing labor shortages, and from March onwards, foreigners outside the EU can work in Germany while awaiting qualification approval, with the ability to stay up to three years.

Pathways for Qualifications and Training

(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates)

In a bid to accommodate individuals aligning their foreign training with German qualifications, the revamped Skilled Immigration Act will introduce flexible provisions from March 1. Those undergoing training to attain a German-equivalent qualification for up to three years will be permitted to work part-time, capped at 20 hours per week. This flexibility extends to students and trainees, fostering a more inclusive approach to work-study arrangements.

First round of changes to Germany's skilled immigration rules takes effect
Skilled workers seeking recognition of their foreign qualifications in Germany can start working directly upon agreement with their German employers, even during the recognition procedure. This measure allows for a stay of up to three years, provided the individual possesses a professional qualification of at least two years and a minimum A2 level proficiency in German.

Family Reunification Simplified
In an effort to streamline family reunification processes for skilled workers, the Skilled Immigration Act will also ease requirements for spouses, underage children, and, notably, parents or parents-in-law. While demonstrating the ability to support livelihoods remains a requirement, the need to prove sufficient living space will be scrapped.

Skilled workers can bring their parents or parents-in-law to Germany if their residency permits are valid from March 2024 onwards. This adjustment recognizes the importance of family ties and aims to create a more supportive environment for skilled workers establishing themselves in Germany.

Opportunity card

Germany, desperate for workers, finally starts befriending immigrants
From June 1, an ""opportunity card"" based on a points system is slated for introduction in June. This card, designed for individuals with an equivalent foreign qualification, grants them the opportunity to seek employment in Germany for a one-year period, contingent upon demonstrating financial self-sufficiency. Those without an equivalent foreign qualification must possess a university degree or a vocational qualification of a minimum two years, along with proficiency at either A1-level German or B2-level English.

Holders of the opportunity card can engage in employment for up to 20 hours weekly, even during a probationary period. Furthermore, the option exists to extend the card's validity for up to two additional years, subject to individuals securing a contract for qualified employment. These progressive measures aim to create a more accessible and supportive pathway for individuals pursuing qualifications and establishing themselves in Germany.

Restrictions for asylum seekers
Chancellor Olaf Scholz has expressed support for ""large-scale"" deportations for rejected asylum applicants, and the Repatriation Improvement Act aims to streamline the deportation process.

Key changes for asylum-seekers include an end to advance announcements of deportations, an extension of asylum detention to 28 days, enhanced police powers for searching and accessing property, and faster deportations for individuals suspected of criminal associations.

The film, which was officially announced at Disney's D23 Expo in 2022, is based around a team of Marvel antiheroes and supervillains.

According to entertainment news outlet Deadline, Yeun left the project due to scheduling issues as the film's production was impacted by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) strikes in 2023.

Yeun, known for his performances in 'The Walking Dead' show and movies such as 'Okja', 'Minari' and 'Nope', was cast for a key role in the Marvel Studios film last February.

'Thunderbolts' will feature an ensemble cast of Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, David Harbour, Hannah John-Kamen, Wyatt Russell, Olga Kurylenko and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

Jake Schreier of 'Paper Towns' fame will direct the film, which is scheduled for release in July 2025.

Some new changes have been announced to UPI from January 1, 2024.
Here are the new rules and features of UPI that you need to be aware about.
The year 2024 has begun and with this, there have been some changes in the financial sector. Unified Payments Interface (UPI), the country’s fastest growing mode of payment has some new rules that you need to keep in mind.

To improve UPI and improve user experience, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) have formulated some new rules and regulations that have come into effect from January 1, 2024.

In this post, we look at the five new changes in UPI that you need to be aware about –
Inactive UPI IDs
As per guidelines by the NPCI, payment apps such as PhonePe, Google Pay, PayTM and more are required to verify and maintain active UPI IDs. UPI IDs that haven’t been used for a year will be deactivated.

So, if you have a UPI ID that hasn't been used in a long time, it is important to at least make one payment soon to avoid deactivation of that ID.
Fraud prevention
In a bid to reduce the increasing financial frauds, the central bank has reportedly proposed a 4-hour window for users making a first payment of ₹2,000 or more to a new recipient. During this window, the users will be able to modify or reverse the transaction, if they haven’t transacted with the person before.
Increased transaction limit
To help users making large transactions to hospitals and educational institutions, the transaction limit for such institutions has been increased from the existing INR 1 lakh to INR 5 lakh. This will make it easier for those paying large amounts to such institutions to complete their payment.
UPI ATMs
In a bid to make it easier for users to withdraw cash, NPCI in collaboration with Hitachi Payment Services has started rolling out UPI ATMs, which allow users to withdraw cash using UPI apps, without having to carry a debit card. The first ATM has already been launched and more ATMs will be rolled out across the country.
UPI for secondary market
NPCI’s UPI for secondary market project has entered the beta phase, allowing selected users to block funds post-trade confirmation in the secondary market. This enabled settling of funds on T 1 basis via clearing corporations.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/parliament-security-breach-case-hc-dismisses-plea-by-accused-neelam-azad-seeking-release/articleshow/106513197.cms,"The Delhi High Court on Wednesday dismissed a petition by Neelam Azad, an accused arrested in the December 13 Parliament security breach case, seeking her release on the grounds that her police remand was illegal. A bench headed by Justice Suresh Kumar Kait said the petition, which alleged that Azad was not allowed to consult a lawyer of her choice before the trial court at the time of remand, was not maintainable.

""Petitioner has already moved bail application before the trial court. Present petition is not maintainable and is dismissed accordingly,"" the bench, also comprising Justice Manoj Jain, said.

Azad's lawyer argued the trial court granted her custody to police in violation of the provisions of the Constitution as she was not allowed to consult a legal practitioner of her choice to defend her during the trial court proceedings. Also, the order remanding her in police custody was passed without application of mind, he said.

""I am seeking release on the ground that my fundamental right was violated,"" he argued.

During the hearing, the high court said no case of violation of her fundamental rights was made out.

""This can't be the ground. Whatever (legal aid) lawyer was there, the trial court passed the order...There is no such right violated. Go to the trial court. Your case is pending there,"" the court told the petitioner's counsel.

The lawyer for the city police said Azad has already filed a bail application seeking her release in the present FIR which concerns offences under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).

The lawyer also contended that the petition was not maintainable, and her police custody was already coming to an end on January 5.

In her petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus directing her production before the high court as well as an order to ""set her at liberty"", Azad said not allowing her to consult a lawyer of her choice amounted to violation of her fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution, making the remand order unlawful. The trial court has remanded her in police custody till January 5.

Under Indian laws, a detainee or a person on their behalf can file a habeas corpus petition in a high court or the Supreme Court for their production if they feel they have been detained illegally. Upon production, if the court concerned concludes that the detention is illegal, it can order their release.

""Upon her arrest, the petitioner's family wasn't informed. It was informed only in the evening of 14.12.2023. Further, she wasn't permitted to meet any person including advocates which is mandatory under Article 22(1) of the Constitution of India. Even at the court a single DLSA (Delhi Legal Services Authority) counsel was appointed to all the accused persons without giving them any choice among counsels,"" the plea, filed through lawyer Suresh Kumar, alleged.

""The remand order dated 21.12.2023 is illegal and violative of Article 22(1) of the Constitution of India which mandates the accused person to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice whereas in the present case the petitioner's advocate wasn't permitted to take instructions and defend the petitioner prior to the disposal of the remand application,"" the plea added.

The petition also said she was produced before the trial court on December 14 ""after a period of 29 hours from the time of arrest"".

Article 22(2) of the Constitution says every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of 24 hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate.

On December 21, the trial court had extended till January 5 the police custody of four accused, including Azad, arrested in the Parliament security breach case, after the city police said they needed to uncover all those involved in the conspiracy.

While the four were arrested on the day of the incident itself, two others were apprehended later.

In a major security breach on the anniversary of the 2001 Parliament terror attack on December 13, 2023, two persons identified as Sagar Sharma and Manoranjan D jumped into the Lok Sabha chamber from the public gallery during Zero Hour, released yellow gas from canisters and shouted slogans before being overpowered by some MPs.

Around the same time, two others- Amol Shinde and Azad- also sprayed coloured gas from canisters while shouting ""tanashahi nahi chalegi"" outside the Parliament House premises.

Besides the four accused, police have also arrested Lalit Jha and Mahesh Kumawat in the case. All are being interrogated in police custody.

The high court had recently stayed the trial court's direction to the city police to supply a copy of the FIR to Azad, noting that it is a case of sensitive nature and, according to a judgment of the Supreme Court, the FIRs in sexual offences, offences pertaining to insurgency, terrorism and of that category, and those under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act are not to be uploaded on website of the authorities.

Under the CAA brought in by the Narendra Modi government, Indian nationality will be granted to persecuted non-Muslim migrants -- Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis and Christians -- from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan who had come to India till December 31, 2014.

There were massive protests in some parts of the country after the CAA was passed by Parliament in December 2019 and received the presidential assent subsequently.

A senior government functionary on Tuesday said Rules for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019 will be notified ""much before"" the announcement of the Lok Sabha elections.

Tagging a media report on the remarks by the government functionary, Tewari said, ""In a country that has Secularism enshrined in the Preamble of its Constitution can religion be the basis of Citizenship whether extra-territorial or even territorial? The answer is no.""

""This was the nub of my argument when I led the opposition to the CAA Bill in the Lok Sabha in December 2019. It is the Core question in the Challenge before the Supreme Court,"" the MP from Punjab said.

""Hypothetically-Tomorrow a government could argue that religion will be the basis of Citizenship even territorially not place of birth or the other criterion for citizenship in the Constitution of India or the Citizenship Act,"" he said.

In the name of reasonable classification to surmount religious persecution in our neighbourhood, Tewari said, he hopes the ground is not being prepared for some other ""insidious template"".

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/beware-these-7-factors-can-pose-risks-to-bull-run-in-dalal-street-2024/articleshow/106465790.cms,"Ushering into 2024, equity market bulls are optimistic, even though they are penciling in relatively lower returns compared to 2023.

The optimism stems from various factors that turned conducive for India when compared to major global markets, which also made the former one of the most sought after emerging markets in 2023.

After a stellar 20% return in 2023, several money managers are entering into the New Year with a “cautiously optimistic” tone.

A series of crucial events like the , , and global central banks’ policy actions will bring in bouts of volatility in the market, but there are several factors that pose risks to the sheer optimism among the bulls.


After the sharp run-up in 2023, India is trading at premium valuations versus its long-term averages, both in absolute as well as relative terms, said experts.

On a 1-year forward basis, India is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 times, whereas the Emerging Market basket is trading at 11.7 times.

If we look at the valuation of stocks in terms of market capitalization, then midcap and smallcap stocks are trading significantly higher than their long-term averages after the spectacular run in 2023.

India’s decent macroeconomic fundamentals, strong expectations of lower global interest rates on the back of declining headline and core inflation in major economies, and reduced election risk after the BJP’s strong performance in recent state elections may keep the Indian

market’s valuation at elevated level, says Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities.

While these conducive factors will support premium valuations over the medium term, one could see unfavourable risk-reward triggering correction in the market.

“We remain cautiously optimistic on the market from a medium term perspective. Our caution is because markets are trading at a premium to its current fair value,” said Vinay Paharia, CIO - equities, at PGIM India Mutual Fund.


One of the crucial factors contributing to the premium valuation multiple of the market is earnings growth.

Despite higher interest rates and inflation risks, India Inc reported robust earnings for the first half of the current financial year, which led to earnings upgrades.

The consensus estimates for Nifty EPS growth for FY24 is 17-20%, and for FY25 is 14-15%. The recent upward revision in earnings estimates have also been resilient and better than the long-term trends.

Over the last 2-3 years, the rebound in earnings growth has been broad-based across sectors, with nearly all sectors seeing a sharp recovery in 12-month-forward EPS.

The sectors that have led the change in the earnings trajectory are financials, automobiles, real estate, and industrials given the robust domestic macroeconomic conditions and continued investments by the government to push growth.

Continuity of policy reforms, and further pick up in private and public capex is crucial to sustain the earnings growth momentum and any major reversal in the same could pose downside risks to growth estimates.


Capital flows were, are, and will always remain a key driver for equity markets. In 2023, India saw nearly $24 billion of inflows from foreign portfolio investors, which was closer to the level seen in 2020.

Meanwhile, domestic institutional investors pumped in nearly $23 billion into the markets last year. This strong inflows from DIIs is backed by sustained flows from retail investors through he systematic investment plan (SIP) route.

Investments through SIPs were at a record high in November, topping Rs 17,000 crore-mark.

However, experts do see some risks to inflows in 2024 due to a lot of factors.

“While DII inflows into equity markets could be a structural trend, it surpasses FII inflows by a wide margin as what was seen in 2023 might not be sustainable,” Paharia said.

FII flows, on the other hand, would be a function of multiple factors, including global interest rates, liquidity conditions and relative attractiveness of India versus other investment destinations, fund managers said.


Global growth slowed down in 2023 due to stubbornly high inflation and constrained liquidity due to continued hike in interest rates.

While easing of inflation in the past few months prompted central banks globally to hit the pause button and also guide for rate cuts in 2024, the overall growth rate remains uneven.

“Global inflation has peaked, but the last mile to target will take a period of subpar growth. Growth stepped down in 2023, and should be slower at just under 3% for 2024 and 2025,” Morgan Stanley said.

The investment bank expects global growth at 2.8% YoY in 2024, and 2.9% in 2025.

With the US Federal Reserve guiding for 75 basis points of rate cut in 2024, economists expect a soft landing of the economy, but see growth slowing down.

“We expect growth to slow from an estimated 2.4% in 2023 to 1.9% in 2024; because the labor market slackens only a bit, labor income is supported, and falling inflation means real income is resilient,” Morgan Stanley said.

Not only the US, but even Europe, the UK, and China, growth is expected to be only marginally positive in 2024.

Moderate global growth poses risks to earnings revival for export-oriented sectors such as information technology.


While 2022 saw economies worldwide being hit by the Ukraine-Russia war, geopolitical unrest in the Middle East gripped investors in late 2023. In October, a war began between Israel and Palestinian militants, especially Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), when Hamas launched a land, sea, and air assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip.

This had pushed crude oil prices higher, US bond yields to multi-year highs and led to sell-off in equities.

Any escalation in geopolitical tensions, therefore, pose risks to the external sector, and subsequently markets.


Led by weak demand and geopolitical tensions, crude oil had a rollercoaster ride in 2023.

After hitting a 17-month low of $63.64 a barrel in May 2023 due to a major banking crisis in the US and Europe, oil prices started inching higher from June due to output cuts by OPEC and geopolitical tensions between Israel and Hamas.

Currently, crude oil prices are hovering around $71 a barrel, seeing around 13% appreciation from the May lows.

With growth in major developed economies expected to slowdown in 2024, the decisive factors influencing prices will be how the demand scenarios unfold in the US and China.


2024 is also perhaps going to be the election year, because at least 64 countries are set to hold national elections this year, and this includes key ones such as India, US, UK, Russia, Taiwan, and South Korea.

In India, the recent victory in the state elections for the Bharatiya Janata Party saw the market partly discounting continuity of the incumbent government at the centre. Nevertheless, volatility associated with the event is likely to keep both bulls and bears on the edge.

The US will go for polls in November, and it will be important to see if Joe Biden manages a win for the second term or will former President Donald Trump secure a victory.

In Taiwan, whoever attains victory will fundamentally shape China’s approach to the self-governed island as it has repeatedly threatened with invasion."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/government-pulls-plug-on-indian-science-congress-official/articleshow/106514895.cms,"The government has pulled the plug on the funding of the association that organises the Indian Science Congress every year, a senior official said on Wednesday. Organised by the Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA), the inauguration of the Indian Science Congress on January 3 every year was a keenly awaited event amongst a section of the scientific community.

Following differences with the ISCA on the content of the five-day annual event, the Department of Science and Technology (DST) announced in September last year that ""support from all its resources for the forthcoming ISC event in 2024 will be discontinued.""

In the wake of the withdrawal of support by the DST, Lovely Professional University had offered to host the event after Lucknow University, which was the original host for the 2024 Congress, pulled out.

The DST provides Rs 5 crore to the ISCA every year for hosting the Congress with sizable funds being allocated to the host institution to make arrangements for the five-day event.

""The DST can think of resuming the funding if ISCA mends its ways,"" the official said.

The Indian Science Congress could not be organised in 2021 and 2022 due to the Covid pandemic. The 108th Congress in Nagpur last year was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi via video conferencing.

Last month, the ISCA put the 109th Congress on hold after Lovely Professional University withdrew as host of the event.

ISCA President Arvind Saxena said the association had decided to post an appeal on its website inviting universities to host the event possibly in February.

The ISCA has been organising the Indian Science Congress every year since 1914. Since Independence, the prime minister has been inaugurating the annual gathering of scientists.

There have been differences between the government and the ISCA over the last few years over the event's organisation. The government has been promoting the India International Science Festival (IISF) as a parallel event since 2015.

The ISCA has also moved court against the DST, alleging government interference in its functioning.

Once a premier event for the scientific community, the quality of presentations at the Congress had witnessed a sharp decline over the past couple of decades triggering demands from within for reforms, which were nowhere to be seen.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/crypto-news/retik-finance-retik-price-prediction-2024-how-realistic-is-100/articleshow/106486089.cms,"Retik Finance (RETIK) has emerged as a promising newcomer in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space, garnering significant attention during its ongoing presale. With a compelling vision to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of crypto, RETIK boasts a multifaceted ecosystem encompassing a wallet, DeFi debit cards, and a seamless payment solution – all powered by its native token, $RETIK. But amidst the hype and excitement, a crucial question lingers: can RETIK truly reach the ambitious price target of $100 by 2024?

Recent achievements
The ongoing presale of RETIK tokens is currently in its third stage, with a price point set at $0.05 per token. The presale has seen tremendous interest from investors, with over 80 million of the total 85 million tokens allocated for this stage already sold out. This surge in demand has resulted in a remarkable $3.3 million being raised thus far, a testament to the strong initial community backing for the project. While the current price of $0.05 may seem like a bargain for investors, achieving the target price point of $100 per token would require a staggering 2000x increase. This would necessitate a confluence of favourable factors, such as sustained demand, positive market sentiment, and effective marketing and development efforts.

If RETIK manages to achieve such a feat, it would be a remarkable accomplishment and a testament to the project's underlying value, but RETIK can move closer to the predicted price due to its contributions to the ecosystem and the community. Retik Finance’s (RETIK) anticipated ascent in 2024 is poised to be catalysed by a confluence of pivotal factors. The widespread integration of its comprehensive ecosystem, spanning from the wallet and debit cards to the payment system, is poised to generate a surge in demand for $RETIK, potentially propelling its intrinsic value. The trajectory of the cryptocurrency market, particularly a bullish trend, could result in a heightened capital influx into the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector, positioning RETIK favourably alongside its contemporaries.

A realistic trajectory: Where could RETIK land in 2024?
While the idea of RETIK reaching $100 by 2024 may be an enticing prospect, it is important to consider a more realistic trajectory for the promising newcomer in the DeFi space. Taking into account the current presale price of $0.05 per token and the various factors that could contribute to its growth, a target range of $3-$10 seems more attainable. Even at this range, RETIK would represent a significant increase from its current presale price and reflect a successful launch, growing user base, and increasing value within its ecosystem.

Factors such as successful product launches, strategic partnerships, and a thriving crypto market could all contribute to such an outcome. One key factor that could contribute to RETIK's growth is the widespread integration of its comprehensive ecosystem, including its wallet, DeFi debit cards, and payment solution – all powered by $RETIK. As more users begin to utilise these offerings, the demand for $RETIK could increase, potentially propelling its intrinsic value. Additionally, strategic partnerships with established entities in the finance and technology sectors could significantly expand RETIK's user base and bolster its credibility, laying the groundwork for potential growth in its market value.

Such partnerships could also bring new opportunities for innovation and development, further contributing to RETIK's success. As the Retik Finance (RETIK) team continues to focus on successful product launches, strategic partnerships, and consistent execution of its vision, RETIK has the potential to achieve significant growth in the coming years and establish itself as a major player in the DeFi space.

While Retik Finance has certainly made waves in the DeFi space with its comprehensive ecosystem and ambitious vision, the big question on everyone's mind is whether RETIK can truly achieve a $100 price target by 2024. While this may seem like a far-fetched goal right now, RETIK has the potential for significant growth in the coming years by focusing on building a strong user base, navigating the competitive landscape, and delivering tangible value through its innovative solutions.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/byjus-general-counsel-roshan-thomas-resigns-at-crisis-hit-edtech/articleshow/106512258.cms,"Byju’s general counsel Roshan Thomas has resigned from the company adding to the spate of senior-level exits at the trouble edtech firm over the past few months.

Thomas, a former Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas partner had joined Byju’s in 2021.

The decision to move on came after “careful consideration of various factors,” Thomas posted on networking site LinkedIn. “I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work alongside talented colleagues and professionals. Navigating through challenging and tumultuous situations has been both a learning experience and a privilege,” he added.

Over the past year or so, Byju’s has faced several challenges, including an ongoing cash crunch, delayed financial results, alleged forex violations, multiple lawsuits, and parts of its business shutting down.

Other recent senior level exits include those of chief financial officer Ajay Goel, India business chief Mrinal Mohit, and business vertical heads Mukut Deepak, Pratyusha Agarwal, Himanshu Bajaj and Ananya Tripathi.

Beyond the top management churn, Byju’s cash problems have led to the company cutting down its workforce through the past year.

ET reported in September last year that the company took a major restructuring which included firing 4,000-4,500 employees.

Top shareholders of Byju’s have put forth conditions to facilitate any fresh capital infusion, asking company founder Byju Raveendran to loosen his control on the edtech firm, as reported by ET on November 29."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/ipl-title-rights-base-price-set-at-1750-crore/articleshow/106459565.cms,"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has set the base price for the IPL title sponsorship rights at Rs 350 crore per year for 74 matches or Rs 1750 crore for five years. However, the cricket board’s decision to grant Tata Sons the right to match the highest bid for Indian Premier League (IPL) title sponsorship rights has perplexed prospective bidders, said people familiar with the situation.

The BCCI has also advised bidders to bid for 84 and 94 matches at Rs 375 crore and Rs 400 crore base price, respectively.

""However, the decision will be taken based on the aggregate value of the 74 matches,"" said a source privy to the development.

The BCCI plans to raise the number of matches to 84 in 2025 and 2026 and 94 in 2027.

However, executives involved in formulating the strategy for the IPL title sponsorship bids for leading companies feel the right-to-match provision will benefit Tata Sons who paid Rs 670 crore over two years for the IPL title sponsorship rights.

""The right-to-match clause is perplexing. Brands are confused about participating in the IPL title sponsorship bidding,"" said a top sports marketing executive who has worked on numerous high-profile sponsorship deals.

On December 12, the BCCI released a tender for title sponsor rights for the IPL seasons 2024–2028. The tender will be available for purchase until January 8.

However, insiders noted that another way to look at the right-to-match clause is that the BCCI intends to do price discovery as Tata Sons might have declined to pay more than the base price.

""That said, if a brand submits the highest bid for IPL title rights and Tata Sons matches it, it will be a major loss of face for the executive who advocated the idea to the company's board,"" said an executive.

BCCI is obligated to inform Tata of the highest bid amount received for title sponsorship rights as per the previous title sponsor agreement.

Tata can match the highest financial bid within five working days of the opening of financial bids and notify the BCCI of its intent.

If Tata decides to exercise the right to match the highest bid, the BCCI will have to grant the IPL title sponsorship rights to the company.

A top executive at a leading sports marketing firm said the ability to match the highest bid gives Tata Sons an unfair advantage over competitors. ""What's the point of bidding for the sponsorship deal if Tata eventually decides to match the highest bid?"" the executive asked.

The BCCI has also said it reserves the right to cancel or amend the bidding procedure at any time and without providing any reason.

In 2022, Tata Sons replaced mobile handset manufacturer Vivo as the title sponsor of the IPL. Vivo had acquired the IPL title sponsorship rights for a whopping Rs 2200 crore for the 2018–2022 seasons.

The victim reportedly joined an investment group after noticing an advertisement on a social media platform.
The invested amount includes a loan of ₹70 lakh and proceeds from sale of property.

In yet another online scam, a Pune man reportedly lost a huge amount in a new fake investment scam. A 45-year-old clinical researcher has reportedly lost ₹2.1 crore over the span of a month.

According to a report by The Indian Express, the victim fell prey to a fake investment scam, where the scammers used the name of a well-known US-based venture capital fund to deceive the victim.

The victim has registered a complaint with the Wakad police station in Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune.
What is the fake investment scam?
The victim started investing in the stock market in 2023 as he was working from home. In November 2023, the victim came across an advertisement on a social media platform.

In this advertisement, a share market investment platform was advertised and the name of a well-known venture capital firm based out of the US was mentioned alongside.

The platform offered online tutorials for share market investment and promised to help the victim build a good investment portfolio.

When he clicked the ad, the victim was redirected to a WhatsApp group, which he joined. The admins of the group then shared online tutorials and guides for investment. The members were also encouraged to join the company’s platform for investment.

The victim was then directed to download an application on their phone and then asked to make large investments on the application.

Over the next few weeks, the victim reportedly transferred ₹2.15 crore to the platform to make investments. This includes money received from sale of property and loans worth ₹70 lakh taken for investments.

The victim was then reportedly asked to invest an additional ₹4.33 crore in an initial public offering (IPO) of an oil company. When the victim was unable to do so, he was informed that his initial investment had been frozen.

The victim then tried to call the numbers that he had communicated with on WhatsApp, but was unable to do so. Upon further investigation, he found that the platform had no connection to the venture capital fund.

Upon realising this, the victim approached the police, who found the fraudsters had created fake social media profiles to scam the victim.

Initial investigation has revealed that the fraudulent accounts are located in Delhi, Mumbai, Noida, Rajasthan and Telangana.
How to protect yourself from such scams
Here are some ways you can protect yourself from such scams –

Do not click on investment advertisements you see on social media or other websites. If possible, report them to the platform.
Do not join groups on social media platforms if you do not know the person or the organisation running it.
Avoid dealing with unknown platforms offering high return on investments.
Use well-known and reliable platforms to invest in the stock market.
Do not invest in unknown platforms without proper verification.

After the BJP's landslide victory in the Madhya Pradesh assembly polls held in November 2023, the party chose Mohan Yadav as the chief minister, replacing Chouhan who served as the state's CM for four times.

Chouhan, while addressing a gathering in Shahganj town under his Budhni assembly seat on Tuesday evening, got emotional and said he will continue to be among the people, especially his sisters.

""I will not go anywhere. I will live here and die here,"" Chouhan said when a couple of women sitting in the audience shouted ""bhaiyya (brother), don't go anywhere leaving us alone.""

The former chief minister said all the works started by the previous BJP government, including the Ladli Behna Yojana (for women's welfare), housing scheme for beneficiaries of the Ladli Behna scheme, a scheme of one job in each family and promises made to farmers, will be fulfilled by the present government.

""The new government will take forward all these works. There must be some big objective somewhere, sometimes by the time 'rajtilak' takes place, one even ends up in 'vanvas' (exile). But all this happens to fulfil some or the other objective,"" Chouhan told the gathering.

He said the present ruling dispensation will implement all these schemes as there is BJP's government in the state and not of the Congress.

The former CM also noted that children who were among the audience had come to show their love for ""mama"" (maternal uncle - as Chouhan is popularly referred).

Earlier, a large number of BJP workers and women welcomed Chouhan on his arrival in Shahganj.

Chouhan won the election from Budhni assembly seat by a margin of more than 1.04 lakh votes over his Congress rival Vikram Mastal.

In the November 2023 state elections, the BJP bagged 163 of the 230 assembly seats, posting a resounding victory and retaining power in the central state.

The opposition Congress was relegated to a distant second spot with victory in 66 assembly segments, while one seat was won by the Bharat Adivasi Party.

Kamath recounted a prank he pulled off in 2014, involving fake policemen raiding the Zerodha office, leaving a lasting impact on the unsuspecting employees.

Recalling the incident with a touch of nostalgia, Kamath said, ""I ran a prank in the office. I got these Kannada actors to raid our office as cops. We captured this whole thing…I knew back then that this was the place to be. I had these random ideas…no one would have ever thought that a stockbroker would run a prank video of cops raiding, saying that ‘your founder is a cheat and has run away'...I mean the reaction in that video was just crazy… I mean half our office was crying that day.""

The prank, orchestrated with meticulous detail, involved the fake cops accusing Zerodha founders, Nithin and Nikhil, of forgery, creating an atmosphere of extreme stress and confusion among the employees. A video of the prank, posted by Kamath on social media in 2019, garnered significant attention, amassing 1.8 million views on YouTube.

— Nithin0dha (@Nithin0dha)

The video opens with a message from Nithin Kamath: “We carried out a fake police raid in our office to see how the team reacts to extreme stress and to have some fun, of course.” Technicians can be seen setting up cameras as the actors, armed with a fake high court order, enter the office, disrupting the normal workflow. The employees, visibly stressed and perplexed, resist the intrusion, trying to make sense of the unexpected raid.

One employee, who was part of the prank, reflected, ""It's nice to sit back and laugh at this now. I wasn't laughing when it was happening.""

Kamath, in the podcast, emphasized the company's longstanding focus on content, citing their early blogging initiatives from the inception of Zerodha. ""Right from Day 1 when we started Zerodha, we started blogging, and we knew that the superpower we had as a business was transparency,"" he remarked.

He also touched upon the changing landscape of content consumption, noting a shift towards visual content. ""From 2016 onwards, the efforts that we put on content started having a draining result. People stopped consuming traditional content, and you started seeing that change,"" Kamath explained.

The Zerodha founder's revelation sheds light not only on the company's commitment to transparency but also on the camaraderie and lighthearted moments that have shaped its corporate culture. The prank, while causing temporary distress, remains a memorable chapter in the journey of Zerodha, a company that has grown significantly since the amusing episode in 2014."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/fuel-price-cut-held-no-discussions-with-omcs-on-petrol-diesel-price-cut-says-oil-minister-puri/articleshow/106511708.cms,"Government-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) have not been in talks with the Centre on possible fuel price cuts, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Wednesday.

“First of all, all these media reports were not only speculative, but I would also turn around and say, slightly mischievous. I have clarified there has been no discussion with OMCs on any such issues. We are in a very highly turbulent situation. There are two areas on the global map which are in conflict situation,” he said.

Ahead of the General Elections due to be held in 2024, social media was rife with rumours of a cut in petrol & diesel prices. However, Puri said these news reports on cuts in fuel costs are misleading.

Earlier in December, news agency PTI quoted a senior Finance Ministry official on the prospects of a cut in taxes on petrol and diesel. At the time, the official said the prices of Brent Crude had already cooled in the international markets and as such, there was no case for a cut in excise duty on fuel.

""When crude oil prices were high, we cut excise duty. When prices have already cooled, the question of tax cut is not there. You can ask for price cut (of petrol and diesel), but it will not be because of a cut in taxes,"" PTI quoted the official as saying.

During the interaction, Puri said that India is currently focused on diversifying its oil sources. Currently, India depends on imports to meet over 85 per cent of its oil needs.

Puri said that India will buy Venezuelan oil, adding that Indian refineries are capable of processing the heavy oil from the South African country. Puri said New Delhi is willing to resume oil import with any nation that is not under sanction.

""India will buy Venezuelan oil. Many of our refineries including one in Paradip are capable of processing heavy oil from Venezuela. We are willing to resume (oil import) with anyone who is not under sanction,"" he had said,

""We are in a situation where we are using crude oil 5 million barrels/ per day. And it is increasing every day. If Venezuela oil comes to market we will welcome it,"" he added.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/pharma-is-the-play-for-outperformance-now-weakness-in-3-sectors-rohit-srivastava/articleshow/106511889.cms,"Rohit Srivastava, Founder, Strike Money Analytics & Indiacharts, says “pharma is the play for outperformance right now. Weakness probably could easily come into the financials, auto sector and PSU stocks in general, I am not talking of PSU banks, but the other PSUs in general, the PSE Index, for example. That is a place where I think we have pretty much exhausted the current moves. Some of them are extremely overbought on long term readings and that is where I think the trouble could be.”

What are your thoughts on Nifty and Bank Nifty, particularly PSU bank part of the Bank Nifty? Also, are you in the camp which believes that the much awaited correction will play out in January after cyclicality plays out or are you in the camp that it may not be so easy?
Rohit Srivastava: I do believe that we are overdue for a correction but we have just started the New Year. It is maybe a bit early for the whole thing to play out. You give it a few days. If the Nifty does not break 21,500 today, it will once again attempt to make a new high towards 21,930. Similarly, on the Bank Nifty also, if we do not break, say, 47,400, we could probably go up to 48,930. So these are the levels we are going to be watching.

There is a possibility that the lower end holds, we make one more attempt to a new all-time high. But eventually, I think it does roll over into the second half of the month to the downside. And that is a risk that we cannot really put off the table based on some of these short-term gyrations. We are not going to give up on the risk side for Jan or for the coming year. January is going to be an important one to help us gauge how it plays out over the next couple of months.

Specifically, you have asked me about the PSU Bank Index. It has been one of the most robust parts of this month. So far today it is holding the 20-day average so you cannot again rule out that it attempts to go higher in the next couple of days. But the more this segment goes up, the more it is getting to a point where one would want to take a slight backseat on PSU banks.

How are you positioning for this series then, your long short ideas, if not at least sectors, the sectors which look weak and the ones which can outperform?
Rohit Srivastava: The easy target is of course to start with the Nifty specific sectors. While they can be difficult, if I have to think of a long sector, it is probably going to be pharma. That is the only one where we are able to see stable strength building up even at this point of time. So it is probably the defensive play of the moment that whatever money is moving out of anywhere in the largecaps is shifting into pharma stocks.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/options/fo-stocks-indian-hotels-manappuram-finance-among-5-stocks-with-long-buildup/articleshow/106510795.cms,"Open interest indicates that bulls are likely to dominate the following counters.

In Wednesday’s trading session, the following five stocks witnessed a build of fresh long positions. Lets first understand how this conclusion is reached that whether the stock has seen a buildup of fresh long position or not. When the stock prices move up and open interest on the counter also moves upward, it is taken as a sign of a long buildup. The signal is considered more reliable if the volume on the counter has also seen an increase.

Manappuram Finance topped the list, the stock price gained 3.96%, and open interest saw a rise of 0.31%. Indus Towers' stock price surged 3.47%, and open interest saw an increase of 4.35%.

stock rose 3.23%, and the open interest saw an increase of 5.03%. Hind Petro price jumped 2.96% and open interest saw an increase of 4.87%. ABB India stock price gained 2.03% and open interest saw an increase of 2.25%.

Some additional checks would help traders in taking better trading decisions as they increase the probability of a follow-up of the upward movement in the stock price. First, if this fresh long build has come when the stock is very close to its 52-week high, that increases the probability of the stock making an attempt to break its previous 52-week high.

Second, if this long buildup is accompanied by any bullish crossover, which means that whether in the current up move when the open interest has moved up the stock price has been able to cross either its 20, 50 or 100-day moving average.

Another couple of points which traders should keep in mind when taking a trade is to look at the matrix of buildup of long positions on the basis of open interest.

Also check whether there is any extraordinary buildup of long positions in any out-of-money call option, especially any far-of-the-money call option. That indicates the probability of any informed person taking exposure through options."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/paras-defence-usually-treads-in-non-competitive-zones-and-creates-a-niche-amit-n-mahajan/articleshow/106511174.cms,"Amit N Mahajan, Director, Paras Defence, says “Paras Defence is currently focussing on the domestic market because it is not just that the domestic market is the biggest market, but it also has a preferential procurement policy in favour of companies like us. So, the export market becomes a plan B. Plan A always will be serving the domestic market which is huge and the opportunities, at least for the next 10 to 15 years, are humongous.”

The company has incorporated the wholly-owned subsidiary, Quantico Technologies. What benefit does this bring to the company?
Amit N Mahajan: Now, when it comes to Quantico Technologies, because it will be riding on the strengths of Paras Defence's existing progress into optics, into electronics, and also into security systems, we will be able to make this as the nodal subsidiary in the coming future. Quantum communication is going to be the key technology, key segment because the communication will slowly get on to quantum communication.

This is the vastness of this particular field and you will be amongst the first few companies to venture into this in the country and not just venture with a particular wish and will but also will be backed by your current strength, your current capabilities and you will be able to map your expertise and your manufacturing capabilities to deliver the next generation technologies for the world.

There is a big-ticket defence deal on agenda as the Modi government hosts the French President on the Republic Day. What are the opportunities that will bring to your stable?
Amit N Mahajan: Paras Defence is into a wide range of technologies and serving platforms from, say, a small UAV to a large submarine or aircraft carrier or for that matter fighter jets. So, we are across all platforms. Paras will directly or indirectly benefit from any indigenisation or any big or a small deal announcement that the Ministry of Defence makes, because from components to systems, we are thereWe are across all segments, all technologies.

Your current order book is in excess of Rs 600 crore. How is it that you are looking to build the order book further and what are the major orders that you already have in the pipeline?
Amit N Mahajan: I would not want to explicitly mention any of the values but the opportunities are looking very promising. The defence sector is very promising right now and this is not just for now, but for the years to stay. The order book is going to be very strong. The bifurcation between the two segments of Paras Defence's core business, that is optics and optronic systems, and defence engineering as a whole both will have a 50-50% share.

Optics and optronic systems will always lead in terms of its profitability, but defence engineering gives that mobility to the business. These are like the two sides of the same coin and they both are very-very important for our business.

Owing to elections, are you seeing any slowing down in decision making, like was witnessed in rail and infra orders?
Amit N Mahajan: Defence is isolated from what happens on the political front because this is directly related to national security and no Indian would want our defence forces to have something which is not in the interest of the nation. As long as you are a nationalist, be it any party, your defence requirements and defence procurement policies will be in favourable conditions to the country and hence, I would not say that defence has got anything to do with what happens whether the elections happen or whether they do not happen. This is all completely driven by the national security requirements of the nation and every Indian should be focussing on making sure that we are safe.

Considering the strong order book you have, are you on track for a 30% to 40% growth in FY24?
Amit N Mahajan: I do not want to put an absolute figure to the revenue as well as the profitability. But I would confirm that we are going to give a strong growth in revenue as the profitability year on year.

What about growth? Is it coming at higher margins or the margins are getting compromised because of the competitive intensity?
Amit N Mahajan: Paras is a little spoilt when it comes to this because Paras usually looks for technologies where there is low or minimal competition. We keep R&D as our focus and we make sure that we are trying to do something which other companies do not enter into. None of our customers get offended. So, we are walking a very cautious path. We ensure that we do R&D in areas which are in line with our strengths and we do justice to whatever development activities that we have taken.

We usually tread in non-competitive zones and create a niche for us as well as for our customers. So, we do not have any problem when it comes to competition. Relatively, Paras with its presence of over so many years has created its own value for its customers and is considered to be one of the most reliable companies in its sector.

Your exports are about 20% of the total revenue. How have exports fared this quarter? Will your revenue pie for exports grow?
Amit N Mahajan: Paras Defence is currently focussing on the domestic market because it is not just that the domestic market is the biggest market, but it also has a preferential procurement policy in favour of companies like us. So, the export market becomes a plan B. Plan A always will be serving the domestic market which is huge and the opportunities, at least for the next 10 to 15 years, are humongous. So, we would want to focus on the domestic market. Obviously nobody will ignore the export market, but it is a plan B and we don’t have any strategy to become an export house."

On Tuesday, long queues of motorists were witnessed at many places in Punjab and a few parts of Haryana over fears that stocks would run dry soon in the wake of truckers' strike against stricter punishments in the new law on hit-and-run cases.

Later in the evening, authorities in some Punjab districts had said the truckers had called off their strike and urged people not to resort to panic buying.

""The situation is normalising now and by evening supplies from depots to all fuel pumps should reach as before. Already, fuel supplies from the depots have started reaching several filling stations,"" said secretary general of the Punjab Petroleum Dealers Association Rajesh Kumar.

He said no long queues like Tuesday were being witnessed at petrol pumps on Wednesday in the state.

The administration in various districts took proactive measures and also tried to resolve things at local level, which has helped the situation return to normalcy, he said.

On Tuesday evening, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla had said the decision to invoke the new hit-and-run cases-related penal provision, which has sparked protests by truckers, will be taken only after consultation with the All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC).

Meanwhile, no long queues were being seen at petrol pumps in Haryana, unlike yesterday when people in some parts of the state, including Panchkula and Ambala, had rushed to fuel pumps.

In Union Territory Chandigarh too, where the administration had on Tuesday ordered rationing of fuel to two- and four-wheelers with immediate effect until normalcy was restored, fuel supplies had started to reach petrol pumps from depots as before, officials said.

On Tuesday, the Punjab government had appealed to the public not to resort to panic buying of fuel, assuring them of the availability of adequate stocks.

Under the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, set to replace the Indian Penal Code, drivers who cause serious road accidents due to negligent driving and run away without informing authorities face up to 10 years in prison or a fine of Rs 7 lakh.

It plans to hire more than 150 students from the class of 2024 across top colleges.

“Meesho had paused campus hiring in 2022 as the focus was primarily on profitable growth. The company was aiming to turn profitable first without increasing the headcount further,” its chief human resources officer Ashish Kumar Singh told ET.

The company is hiring for roles across technology and product, analytics, business, fulfilment and consumer experience, monetisation, finance, growth, and HR. “Non-tech roles like strategy and operations have witnessed an uptick in salary packages in comparison to last year,” Meesho said in a release.

While unsold inventory is on a high, the sales velocity is keeping pace.
Despite interest rates rising 250 basis points between May 2022 to February 2023, courtesy RBI policy action, the real estate demand has only seen acceleration with a steady upward trend in residential prices across major markets. In fact, the demand for residential properties in India continued to surge, hitting a ten-year high in annual sales by reaching 329,097 units sold in 2023, according to a report by Knight Frank.

It is no surprise that India’s financial capital, Mumbai led with the highest sales of 86,871 units, showing a 2% year-on-year growth((Y-o-Y) growth, according to the India Real Estate: Residential and Office (July - December 2023) report.

Mid and premium segments show uptick but…

According to the Knight Frank report, properties priced below ₹50 lakhs faced a decline in sales, dropping from 37% (117,131 units) in 2022 to 30% (97,983 units) in 2023. Escalating property prices, higher home loan rates, and the pandemic's adverse impact played roles in dampening demand within this category. Notably, Mumbai, known for its high prices, experienced a 6% Y-o-Y decrease in affordable housing sales, totaling 39,093 units in 2023.

Conversely, the ₹50 lakh to ₹1 crore segment accounted for 37% of residential sales, growing by 7% annually to 120,280 units in 2023. Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Pune dominated this segment, contributing to over 60% of the sales within this price range.

The premium category, valued at ₹1 crore and above, expanded significantly, comprising 34% of sales in 2023, up from 27% the previous year. This segment witnessed a remarkable 33% Y-o-Y growth, with NCR leading the pack, selling 38,816 units and constituting 65% of the premium segment sales.

Inventory surplus not a matter of concern

Despite the strong growth in sales, there's been a surplus in the number of property launches compared to actual sales, resulting in a 5% Y-o-Y increase in unsold inventory levels.

Concurrently, the market trend favouring the mid and premium segments has also affected the unsold inventory, with both segments showing levels higher than the market average. The mid segment saw a 7% Y-o-Y increase in unsold inventory, while the premium segment experienced a substantial 33% Y-o-Y rise in unsold properties.

While rising inventory levels might seem concerning on their own, it's crucial to analyse them alongside sales velocity to accurately evaluate the market's overall health.

“You also need to look at the sales velocity. The velocity of sales is also shooting up and hence the time to sell is shrinking. Only if velocity of sales does not pick up, there can be a inventory pileup but that yet not happening and so we are not seeing any major pileup of inventory,” says Says Shishir Baijal, Chairman and Managing Director, Knight Frank India,

Prices rise steadily across cities

In 2023, Hyderabad experienced the most significant residential price surge among major Indian cities, with a notable 11% Y-o-Y increase. Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata closely followed with increments of 7% each.

Meanwhile, NCR and Pune observed a 6% and 5% increase, respectively. Chennai and Ahmedabad also saw modest rises in residential prices, each with a 4% increment over the 12-month period.

Sonia Gandhi is the only invitee from Congress's first family to the consecration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Sonia Gandhi received an invite from the temple construction committee chairperson Nripendra Mishra in her role as the chief of the Congress Parliamentary Party.

The trust is extending invitations to three political guest categories: presidents of mainstream parties, leaders of opposition in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and participants in the Ram temple movement from 1984 to 1992. Special guests, including seers, industrialists, artists, and sportspeople, are also on the invitee list.

VHP working president Alok Kumar recently invited Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, the opposition leader in the Rajya Sabha. As the Lok Sabha lacks an official leader of the opposition since 2014, the VHP sent an invitation to Congress's House leader Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary.

The Congress stated it would decide on Sonia Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge's attendance at the ceremony at an appropriate time. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh noted that Gandhi and Kharge received invitations.

The consecration ceremony on January 22 is expected to draw over 6,000 attendees, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

VHP national secretary general Milind Parande emphasized that the ceremony is open to all without political overtones. This statement followed several opposition leaders announcing their decision to skip the event, accusing the BJP and RSS of politicizing religion.

CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury in a social media post said that he will not attend the inauguration ceremony of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, saying that ""the CPI(M) policy has been to respect religious beliefs and safeguarding the right of every individual to pursue their belief. Religion is a personal choice not to be converted into an instrument for political gain.""

Ram Mandir Trustee Kameshwar Chaupal said that an invitation letter has been sent to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for the Pran Pratishtha ceremony in Ayodhya on January 22.

Megastar Rajinikanth has also been invited for the inauguration cerement. Apart from Rajinikanth, invitations have been sent to film personalities that include actors Amitabh Bachchan, Madhuri Dixit, Anupam Kher, Akshay Kumar, Rajkumar Hirani, Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Rohit Shetty along with producer Mahaveer Jain. From the South, the list includes Chiranjeevi, Mohanlal, Dhanush, and Rishab Shetty.


The trust has invited 4,000 saints of all sects for the ceremony. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend the inauguration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.

Vedic rituals for the Pran-Pratishtha (consecration) ceremony of Ram Lalla (infant Lord Ram) in Ayodhya will begin on January 16, next year, a week before the main ceremony. A Vedic priest from Varanasi, Lakshmi Kant Dixit, will perform the main rituals of the consecration ceremony of Ram Lalla on January 22. From January 14 to January 22, Ayodhya will mark the Amrit Mahautsav.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/barc-increases-tv-viewership-meter-count-to-59000-sources/articleshow/106494295.cms,"Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), India's sole TV viewership measurement body, has increased its meter count used for measuring viewership of Indian TV audiences to 59,000 and is on course to touch 65,000 in the near term, say sources privy to the development.

BARC has set a target of installing 65,000 Bar-O-meters which are used to collect TV viewership data, and is adding new meters every month to achieve its target, one of the sources said.

The council had installed 55,000 bar-o-meters as of December 2022, in accordance with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting's (MIB) policy guidelines for TV rating agencies in India.

The increase in meter count comes amid calls from various sections of the industry to increase the BARC to capture precise TV viewership data from India's urban and rural areas.

Meterology Data, in which BARC owns 51% and TAM Media owns the remaining 49%, deploys and maintains the Bar-o-meters. It also has 2500 OOH meters to collect representative data from India's urban and rural areas.

The BAR-O-meters are used to collect real-time data beamed through GSM networks, which are supported by a network of field personnel, electronic equipment, and a strong IT backbone.

BARC is promoted by the Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation (IBDF), the Indian Society of Advertisers (ISA), and the Advertising Agencies Association of India (AAAI).

The IBDF holds a 60% stake in BARC, with the ISA and AAAI owning 20% each.

BARC's TV viewership data, which is based on a sample survey, is used as a currency for trading TV advertising worth Rs 40,000 crore annually.

Over 600 TV channels have currently signed up with BARC to have their viewership measured.

BARC refused to comment on the story.

BARC reported modest revenue growth of Rs 321 crore in FY23, as the TV industry experienced subdued ad revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year due to macroeconomic challenges.

Broadcasters account for over 75% of BARC's revenue, with agencies and advertisers accounting for the rest.

The council's net profit dropped 59% to Rs 36 crore due to increased investments in field-related activities.

BARC's expected cash accrual is expected to be Rs 35–40 crore per fiscal. The company had cash and cash equivalents of Rs 60.40 crore.

Meterology Data's FY23 revenue grew 39% to Rs 107 crore, while net profit rose 66% to Rs 5 crore."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/options/fo-stocks-bhel-jsw-steel-among-5-stocks-with-short-buildup/articleshow/106509428.cms,"In Wednesday’s trading session, the following five stocks witnessed a build of fresh short positions. Lets first understand how this conclusion is reached that whether the stock has seen a buildup of fresh short position or not.

To understand it we have to look at what “ short selling” means. When a trader is expecting the stock prices to fall, he may sell the stock without owning that and buy at a lower price, for example, stock XYZ is trading at 100, a trader sells the stocks at Rs 100 and buys it back at Rs 90. He made a profit of Rs 10. Selling the stocks without owing the underlying stock is called short selling.

Coming to the buildup of fresh short positions, When the stock prices move downward and open interest on the counter increases, it is taken as a sign of a short build-up. The signal is considered more reliable if the volume on the counter has also seen an increase as the stock price was declining.

stock price fell 4.9% and open interest saw an increase of 16.49%.

price declined 3.76% and open interest saw a rise of 2.84%.

saw stock pricing dipping up by 3.54% and the open interest saw an increase of 7.92%.

stock price declined by 3.01% and open interest saw a rise of 5.94%.

ICICI Lombard General Insurance stock price declined by 2.95% and open interest saw a rise of 3.49%.

Some additional checks would help traders in taking better trading decisions as they increase the probability of a follow-up of the upward movement in the stock price.

First, if this long build-up is accompanied by any bearish crossover, which means that whether in the current down move when the open interest has moved up the stock price has moved below its 20, 50 or 100-day moving average.

Another couple of points which traders should keep in mind when taking a trade is to look at the matrix of build-up of short positions on the basis of open interest.

Also check whether there is any extraordinary build-up of long positions in any out-of-money put option, especially any far-of-the-money out option. That indicates the probability of any informed person taking exposure through options for any possible downside"

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/c-suite/business-transformation-is-need-of-the-hour-but-holes-in-implementation-remain-a-challenge-for-leaders/articleshow/106508665.cms,"For many business leaders, taking the firm through a business transformation or digital business transformation journey is a key responsibility. But it is not an easy process. Leaders can learn multiple things as they embark on this journey.

Expleo, a company that guides organisations in digital transformation, has put together some of the valuable lessons after surveying 1,395 people across 6 countries. Its Business Transformation Index 2023 codified such transformation initiatives for companies in aerospace, automotive, banking and financial services, energy and utilities, healthcare and life sciences, insurance, manufacturing, public sector, retail, telecom, media and transport.

Starting with the definitions
The report defined business transformation as the process through which an organisation makes a fundamental shift in its way of operating, providing value and customer engagement methods.

This involves rethinking culture, process and technology. While technology is the key enabler of the change, it cannot drive this transformation alone. A subset of business transformations is digital transformation, which is bringing in the right mix of digital technologies to drive improvements.

But implementing the changes isn’t easy. The report said 76% of the companies are falling short of achieving at least one target in their business transformation initiatives. The areas of concern are project discipline, which ensures delivering transformation on time and on a budget, and reliability. It also involves balancing profits with business impact. And about the impact on the customers and the users.

Skill shortages are a key area that need focus specifically around emerging technologies like AI and augmented reality. Leaders can broaden and diversify the talent hiring to address this, said the report.

To address possible instabilities, businesses should focus on improving business agility.

About 69% of the companies talked about the challenges of adopting a digital-first strategy.

Design thinking is needed to improve customer experience, and data transformation is often required before transformations can begin.

For sustainability, companies are looking to shift to more circular business models. They are taking actions for recycling of hardware, monitoring of carbon footprint, and other such steps.

Some of the specific threats mentioned by the companies in the survey included cost inflation (48% of respondents) and economic uncertainty (41%). They prioritised resilience and cost control as key aspects.

Looking at the Indian scenario, Manu Saigal, Director-General Staffing, Adecco India, said while digital transformation has enhanced efficiency, productivity and decision-making for Adecco’s leaders, it also presents challenges. Automation and data-driven insights free up leaders’ time for strategic thinking, while real-time data and analytics enable them to make better decisions. This increased agility allows leaders to quickly adapt to changing market dynamics and customer needs.

However, leaders must also keep pace with rapid technological advancements, manage resistance to change from those accustomed to traditional ways of working, and ensure data security and privacy in compliance with complex regulations. Leaders who successfully navigate both the benefits and challenges of digital transformation will be best positioned to thrive in the ever-evolving business landscape, Saigal added.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/sridhar-sivaram-says-fii-flows-we-are-expecting-may-not-materialise-heres-why/articleshow/106508659.cms,"Sridhar Sivaram, Investment Director, Enam Holdings, says “the emerging market as an asset class is getting challenged. If it has not given returns for 20 years, I do not see any reason why this will change in the next four-five years. People are already questioning this asset class. Within that, India has done well. So, various emerging market fund managers are now trying different types of emerging markets, say, emerging market ex-China or Asia ex-China. But I do not think a lot of pension funds or large funds will want to invest in some of these types of funds. Some of my friends who run India dedicated FII money are saying that they are not getting incremental flows. They are getting trickles, not to the extent that they would have expected and anyway most fund managers are already overweight India.”


Will it be a different look for the market this year also?
Sridhar Sivaram: I hope not. Market has been doing very well. So, the same look is good enough.

So, how much of 2023 returns are likely to roll over to 2024?
Sridhar Sivaram: If I had known all that, I would not be sitting here. I will be sitting on some luxurious island….

But you go there, right?
Sridhar Sivaram: So, yes….

So, obviously, you know that is why you go there.
Sridhar Sivaram: I will permanently be there. Jokes apart, I think India will do well. I think the stars are aligned. If I look at emerging markets and see how they have performed, within that only two countries have given 8% plus dollar returns in the last 10 years, which is India and Taiwan. The rest all have been a basket case. I have been saying that emerging markets as an asset class are struggling because they have not given any returns for say 10 years, 15 years, 20 years and every year we see the same thing, one country disappointing versus the other and India stood out there.

I do not see that changing and barring the short term, you can say the market is overdone. There has been a little bit of correction, but over a medium to long term, India will continue to give returns. Over 10 years or 20 years, returns are in the 12-14% range. I do not see any reason why that should change over the next 10 to 20 years.

Are there clusters of overvaluation in the markets?
Sridhar Sivaram: Of course.

PSUs, smallcaps, what is happening in the SME space or even the IPO flurry that we have seen?
Sridhar Sivaram: We remain quite bullish on PSUs, in fact, especially the banks. So, we did a quick number crunching to figure out what has happened, these stocks have gone up so much, how have the earnings grown? Surprisingly the earnings in the last three years have outpaced the stock returns. So, they have got derated….

Earnings have outpaced the stock return?
Sridhar Sivaram: Yes. They got derated because the stocks have not kept pace with the earnings and if I look at the earnings outlook from here on, I think they will do north of 30% barring…

Which category of PSUs are you talking about – metals, PSBs?
Sridhar Sivaram: No, I am talking of the banks, yes. Within the PSUs in general, there are various pockets. So, some pockets like defence and all have become very expensive. There are other pockets, like the oil marketing companies, that look extremely cheap. But they are cheap for a reason. If you want to fast forward and assume that some of these will change, then they are interesting bets. So, there are various pockets which have different valuations. We remain bullish on the entire pack selectively, banks surely and others selectively where we think that earnings look good, opportunity is decent and valuation comfort is far better than other pockets as you mentioned in the markets.

Other than PSBs, where do you find in this market there is value on the table?
Sridhar Sivaram: I would say in some pharma companies where we are seeing some corporate action as the companies are divesting there. Some companies are merging with others. Domestic businesses in some cases are undervalued. So, we do see some opportunities there. Largecap financials look very good. They have not done anything in the last year, maybe for the right reason, because liability costs were going up, so the market was smart enough early enough to understand that liability costs will continue to move up. We think that that looks quite interesting, so that is the other pocket I would say. Otherwise, it is mostly stock specific in most other places.

What are the stocks you like since you are stock specific?
Sridhar Sivaram: Unfortunately, I cannot speak on stocks but yes, you…

How much of the 2023 frenzy is likely to extend to 2024? S Naren answers
You like gold though and the mantra for 2024 is diversify your portfolio, right?
Sridhar Sivaram: I have been speaking of gold for a very long time and my point is simply that if you take gold returns, as gold is a hedge against the currency, people underestimate the currency aspect of gold. A currency has depreciated 4-5% every year, you take the 20-year returns, gold and Sensex have given the same returns, 13%, and you take the last five years also the same returns. So, yes, there will be pockets where the markets will outperform gold or gold outperform the market.

My point is that you have options like SGB, which is financial gold, where you can invest and that gives you a tax-free return; plus it gives you 2.5% interest. If you add up all of that, it actually gives you a return better than the markets. I am not suggesting you do not invest in markets, I am just saying 5% to 10% depending on your appetite, you should invest in gold and I always say that Indian woman has been the best fund managers. We do so much analysis and we struggle to beat the returns that the Indian woman makes by buying gold.

Yes and I do not know what the Indian woman is doing when it comes to buying household items with inflation, etc... But you are a man, you are buying gold, it is not like that.
Sridhar Sivaram: I am buying gold only in the last say seven-eight years or ten years. Indian women have been buying gold for 50 years.

But consumption slowdown seems to be a bit evident within that space. Is that a concern?
Sridhar Sivaram: Yes. I have travelled a lot in the last two months, been to at least four or five different states in the remote places and I can say that it is clearly a K-shaped recovery. There is stress in rural areas and hopefully this, as we come closer to elections, we see an increased spending across the board and maybe that brings a cheer and the consumption starts to boom there. But I would say that we currently are in that K-shaped recovery.

Anything which is urban related and we are seeing the numbers also, they are all doing well. Discretionary consumption, if it is urban, be it hotels, airlines, airports, you just go, you know what is happening there. But as you move into the hinterland, things are a bit slower, I would say. That is how I would categorise how things are right and hopefully this changes in six months.

There are three big assumptions for 2024. One, FIIs will come back and they will be forced to buy into Indian stocks. They will keep on bidding the prices higher. Assumption number two, continuity of the government and that template what has worked so far will continue to roll after May 2024 also. And the third assumption is that earnings will continue to compound anywhere between 12% to 14% or 12% to 15% depending on the estimate. Which assumption out of the three assumptions, these are popular assumptions, consensus assumptions, could be challenged?
Sridhar Sivaram: One….

That FIIs will not come back?
Sridhar Sivaram: No. When I speak to all my friends who run FII money, I heard: One, the emerging market as an asset class is getting challenged. If it has not given returns for 20 years, I do not see any reason why this will change in the next four-five years. People are already questioning this asset class. One of the simple reasons why I have been talking about that this asset class is getting challenged is the fact that this is not a homogeneous asset class. It has countries which have current account surplus and countries which have current account deficits. Countries with 30,000 per capita to 2,000 per capita and commodity exporting countries to commodity importing countries. So, the plus of one is the minus of the other.

Net-net for 20 years, we have not given any returns. Within that, India has done well. So, various emerging market fund managers are now trying different types of emerging markets, say, emerging market ex-China or Asia ex-China. But I do not think a lot of pension funds or large funds will want to invest in some of these types of funds. Some of my friends who run India dedicated FII money are saying that they are not getting incremental flows. They are getting trickles, not to the extent that they would have expected and most fund managers are overweight India, massively….

In financials?
Sridhar Sivaram: Massively overweight India because China has done nothing. So, if you take last three years, I am saying MSCI dollar return, China is down 20%, India is up 10% CAGR. In three years, India has outperformed by 30% CAGR over China. India’s weight has gone from something like 10% to 18% percent in MSCI. So, on that 18%, most funds are already overweight. I do not think FII's will make such a massive difference to the market. I think the domestic flows will continue to surprise.

FIIs at best, may not sell but keep in mind that China has become so cheap that if it turns from here, there will be a lot of people to take that. The positioning is really bad for China right now. It is consensus underweight. India is a consensus overweight and they have not been cheaper and some of my friends explained to me stories in China. I said, wow. I mean, these stories are available at 3PE, 4PE, 50% cash….

And it is pretty much back to normal. I mean, I know people who travel to China.
Sridhar Sivaram: The only problem with China has been that they have not had earnings growth. Perception is one but they also had earnings challenges whereas India has surprised on earnings. So when you mentioned what can be the challenged, the third one also can be challenged to some extent but our earnings trajectory has held very well.

If China comes back, then what happens to this excitement centred around manufacturing, China plus one, EMS? China has a ready supply chain. India is building a supply chain. If China comes back, exports will come back. The supply chains will be rolling. So then what happens to China plus one, Indian manufacturing themes?
Sridhar Sivaram: It is not like China comes back. China is already open but because of the geopolitical issues that China is having with the US, India is in a sweet spot. That is what I mentioned earlier that the stars are aligned for India. So whether China comes back or not, the China plus one story for India remains. Actually, it has become plus one now, not just China, because it is also some European plus one that is happening on the chemical side. So, that plus one story remains.

We remain very constructive on the entire manufacturing, EMS, chemicals, because there may be some cyclical issues in a lot of these. But on a structural basis, we think this is a very bullish space. Just take Apple as an example. There are no listed plays for Apple manufacturing but Apple wants to go from 10 billion exports to 100 billion in the next two to three years. And we know from speaking to supply chain people who are manufacturing, say, you know, some of the components that their orders are like 10 times their current capacity. And they are scared.

I mean, I put up this 10 times capacity, what happens if Apple does not come? So the opportunity space is huge. We will see manufacturing as the next big theme for India like what happened to auto ancillary. You know, 20 years back, we were just an assembly unit in India. And today, 97% or 95% is manufactured within India. I mean, the sceptics say that, oh, this is just an assembly unit, not more than 10%. But that is changing. Maybe in the next three years, we go to 30% manufactured or value added in India. That is huge. And if one Apple does, the entire ecosystem gets built, it becomes a huge industry."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/sc-stays-hc-direction-asking-hp-govt-to-shift-ips-officer-from-post-of-dgp/articleshow/106509361.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the direction of the Himachal Pradesh High Court asking the state government to shift senior IPS officer Sanjay Kundu from the post of Director General of Police (DGP). A bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud granted liberty to Kundu to move the high court to seek recall of its December 26 order.

The bench, also comprising Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, said till the recall application is disposed of by the high court, the direction for transfer of Kundu from the post of DGP of the state shall remain stayed.

The apex court requested the high court to dispose of the recall application within two weeks.

On Tuesday, the top court had agreed to hear a petition filed by Kundu challenging his removal as the Himachal Pradesh DGP following a high court order over allegations that he tried to pressure a businessman who claimed he received threat to his life from his partners.

Kundu's lawyer had told the apex court that the matter was ""extraordinary"" as the high court did not hear the officer before directing the state government to shift him.

Following the high court direction, an order transferring Kundu was issued by the Himachal Pradesh governor on Tuesday. He was transferred to the state's Ayush department as principal secretary.

The high court had directed the state government to shift the state police chief and the Kangra superintendent of police so they don't influence a probe into a businessman's complaint about a threat to his life.

They have been also asked to report to Enforcement Directorate on Mondays and Fridays till the next date of hearing, which is on January 11 . The Enforcement Directorate had moved the Delhi High Court challenging the trial court's order directing the release of the three accused, including the interim CEO of Chinese smartphone maker Vivo and others in a money laundering case.

The trial court last week allowed the plea moved by interim CEO of VIVO India Hong Xuquan, Chief Financial Officer of Vivo India Harinder Dahiya and VIVO's consultant Hemant Munjal who challenged their arrest and subsequent custody in a money laundering case. The trial court had directed their immediate release.

The three arrested accused had claimed that they were arrested on December 21 and had moved an application challenging the arrest and declaring it illegal. On 30th December, the accused were produced before the trial court after the expiry of custodial remand. The ED sought their judicial custody.

Recently, the Patiala House Court of Delhi took cognizance of a prosecution complaint (chargesheet) filed by the ED in connection with a Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) case related to the Chinese mobile company Vivo involving Chinese national Guangwen Kuang, Lava International's MD Hariom Rai, Nitin Garg and Rajan Malik under the different sections of the Money Laundering Act.

According to the ED chargesheet, Vivo India was also named as an accused in the matter. The ED had raided Vivo India offices and the premises of those linked to it in July last year and claimed to have busted a major money laundering racket involving Chinese nationals and multiple Indian companies.

It had then alleged that Rs 62,476 crore was ""illegally"" transferred by vivo-India to China to avoid payment of taxes in India.

The average number of applications from retail investors in initial public offers (IPO) increased to 13.21 lakh, which was more than double of 5.66 lakh in 2022.

The highest number of applications from retail investors were received by at 52.11 lakhs, followed by at 41.30 lakhs, and at 37.34 lakhs.

Through initial public offering (IPO), companies raised Rs 54,114 crore in 2023, which includes both the main board and SME. However, this was nearly 12% lower than 2022, primarily due to the mega IPO of insurance major .

About 57 corporates raised Rs 49,434 crore through main board IPOs in 2023, which was 17% lower in 2022. However, excluding the mega IPO of LIC, which came out in 2022, mobilisation through IPO increased by 28%.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/csb-bank-should-be-able-to-grow-around-50-faster-than-the-system-md/articleshow/106510321.cms,"Pralay Mondal, MD & CEO, CSB Bank, says: “We did not have a very aggressive quarter on the wholesale side. Some of the business got a little postponed to the next quarter and the gold loan has grown by around 23% which is slightly slower than what we generally do because what we did is that gold prices fluctuated and went up significantly. We did not want to ride that wave of gold loan price at this point of time. So, we were a little cautious on the gold loan side as well but still we grew by around 23%.”

While your deposits have seen an uptick on a sequential basis, that is not the case with your CD ratio. That has seen a bit of a decline, right?
Pralay Mondal: I think that was a deliberate move because with the kind of liquidity challenges which are there in the system, we consciously wanted to keep a check on the CD ratio because it had gone closer to 87-88%. So, we wanted to bring it down a little bit from a liquidity risk management perspective and that is one of the reasons where we ensure that our deposit growth sustains and we focus on deposits. This trend will continue for a quarter or two more till we have abundant liquidity in the system.

Given that the Reserve Bank of India wants banks to go easy on unsecured assets, especially personal loans, could that challenge your FY20 for growth numbers?
Pralay Mondal: Not for us because that is somewhat of a systemic issue. We have not really done too much for unsecured business either on the SME side as well as on the retail side. We had just started but we have slowed down a little bit because we thought that let us not catch this cycle at this point of time. We have enough other businesses to focus on. So, from that perspective, some of the franchise and the credit cards and some of the other businesses we are picking up through our partnerships which you have. But right now, we are also going slow on the pure play unsecured personal loans.

What growth rate will you be able to maintain for FY25?
Pralay Mondal: I have said before that we should be able to do anywhere between 30% and 50% faster than the system. We should be able to sustain through the year. Maybe one quarter here and one quarter there can be a little different but overall for the year, I think we should be able to grow around 50% faster than the system.

What are the pockets where you have seen weak growth during the quarter?

Pralay Mondal: In this quarter, we had been a little conscious of our credit growth because we wanted to understand where the liquidity ratios are, the CD ratios are and deposits are not coming cheap anymore as you know. We wanted to ensure that we have the right balance between deposits and assets. We did not have a very aggressive quarter on the wholesale side. Some of the business got a little postponed to the next quarter and the gold loan has grown by around 23% which is slightly slower than what we generally do because what we did is that gold prices fluctuated and went up significantly. We did not want to ride that wave of gold loan price at this point of time. So, we were a little cautious on the gold loan side as well but still we grew by around 23%.

Retail has grown well but that is on a very small base and SME has done well for us as well. Overall that is how it will sustain. Next quarter, we will pick up the gold loan because gold loan prices have stabilized quite a bit now. I think going into next quarter, we will focus back on gold loan, wholesale, SME and retail will sustain wherever it is and hence we should be able to pick up the credit growth little better in the next quarter.

Are you on target to achieve your 5% NIMs target for the full year?
Pralay Mondal: Yes, I am still confident. Let us see. I mean, hopefully we should be able to manage that.

Can you tell us how you are progressing towards increasing your presence in the north and western region, any targets that you have in terms of your branch expansion?
Pralay Mondal: We are adding around 100 odd branches every year. Out of that, roughly 50- 60% we are adding in north and west. Rest of south also we are adding a lot in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra, Telangana but we are doing a lot in Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Mumbai, Delhi locations. So, to that extent, we are taking a cluster and hub approach so that management is focused so that we are not spread too thin because as you know, 100 is not a large number maybe for us but from a distribution perspective not a large number. So, to that extent, we are using a strategic focus.

The other big change we are doing on the distribution side is we are saying that a lot of branches which are doing a lot of business in gold loan but have the potential of doing other branches. We are expanding those branches without adding the count of the branches. So, we may take a fast flow there, we can take a larger area there and hence we are adding beyond gold in these branches.

Effectively, those branches will become more productive from other products’ perspective. That is the strategy and plan. We have started with 25 branches as a pilot project on this specific project which I talked about and if it is successful, next year we will go whole hog on that front.

The Reserve Bank of India has proposed guidelines for small finance banks, strict guidelines on what the dividend pay-out ratio could be, strict guidelines. These are not guidelines but this is like a paper right now for discussion. What do you make of it?
Pralay Mondal: It is the small finance banks. Yesterday, I saw something related to the foreign banks as well. So, we are also going through it, it is too early to comment on that but for us, I think our board will go through all this and decide what we need to do. We are a full service and universal bank. So, to that extent, we will be guided by the universal bank license but broadly, there are measures which have been taken by regulators. What they think is prudent from a dividend payout perspective, let us see how when the final papers come out, we will see how it comes out and then we can comment on that.

If I look at 2021 and 2022, there was a war of liabilities. Everybody wanted to acquire more CASA. Three months ago, it appeared that that fight was over and I also thought that the war of liability was over but when we spoke to the SBI chairman and when I look at the deposit increases they have done in certain categories, it looks like the war is still on. So, will 2024 be another year of war of liabilities which will impact banks and the NIMs going forward?
Pralay Mondal: I completely agree with you that ultimately, the core strength of a bank is the liability franchise. Rest actually are built on the back of the liability franchise and hence, if you see the larger stronger banks which had a sustainable growth decade after decade always had a strong sustainable liability franchise and hence, it was easy and will always remain the strongest strength for a bank. But banks cannot depend on wholesale deposits or cannot depend on the kind of CDs and those kind of things or borrowings alone.

Given that perspective and in between what had happened is obviously, the 10-year GSec both globally as well as India was really coming. I mean, it was very easy but now it had gone up. Now, it has again sort of stable at a certain level 3.92 at the US and India is around 7.2.

It depends on what RBI also wants the liquidity to be in the system. It has broadly remained negative in the last quarter or more. So, given all this perspective I think everybody would like to have their dry powder for growth, not only for Q4, but also for next year, because the economy is giving credit growth opportunities without any doubt about it.

As the capex cycle starts improving on the private side, post-elections and things like that, I think every bank would like to have a source of deposits which is sustainable and consistent. So to that extent, I have no doubt about it, that deposits will remain a key focus and key strength for organizations. We have a smaller balance sheet. It is a different way to manage that. And we are managing that. We are building our casa franchise. It will take some more time, and hence we have to deposit on deposits as well.

We have another book, which is slightly large. So from that perspective, we have a little more focused approach, but for larger banks, they have no choice. They have to focus on deposits as a major strength for the next few years."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/india-registered-9-3-lakh-cancer-deaths-second-highest-in-asia-lancet-study/articleshow/106509594.cms,"India registered about 12 lakh new cancer cases and 9.3 lakh deaths in 2019, becoming the second highest contributor to the disease burden in Asia for that year, according to a new study published in The Lancet Regional Health Southeast Asia journal.

Researchers found that India, along with China and Japan, were the three leading countries in Asia in terms of number of new cases and deaths, where they say cancer has become a more significant public health threat with 94 lakh new cases and 56 lakh deaths in 2019.

Of these, while China contributed the most with 48 lakh new cases and 27 lakh deaths, Japan recorded about 9 lakh new cases and 4.4 lakh deaths, the international team of researchers including those from the National Institute of Technology Kurukshetra and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur and Bathinda, said.

""We examined the temporal patterns of 29 cancers in 49 Asian countries between 1990 and 2019 using estimates from the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries and Risk Factors 2019 Study (GBD 2019),"" they wrote in their study.

They found that in Asia, the leading cancer was that of tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL), resulting in an estimated 13 lakh cases and 12 lakh deaths. It was also found to be most frequent in men and third most frequent in women.

Specifically among women, cervical cancer is ranked second or among top-5 cancers in several Asian countries. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, introduced in 2006, has proved to be effective in preventing the disease and reducing HPV-related deaths, the researchers said.

Overall, in the continent and individual countries, TBL, breast, colon and rectum cancer (CRC), stomach and non-melanoma skin cancer were among the top five most frequent cancers in 2019 with few countries having leukemia, prostate, liver and pancreatic cancers in the list, they said in their study.

Further, smoking, alcohol consumption and ambient particulate matter (PM) pollution remained dominant among the 34 risk factors for cancer, they said.

""The rising cancer burden due to increasing ambient air pollution is concerning in Asia,"" they wrote.

Five of the top 10 countries with regards to population-weighted annual average of PM2.5 in 2019 are present in Asia - India, Nepal, Qatar, Bangladesh and Pakistan, they said quoting the State of Global Air Report, produced annually in collaboration with the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's (IHME's) GBD project.

The researchers said that the primary reasons for increasing air pollution in Asia were industry-led economic growth along with urbanisation, rural-to-urban migration and increasing usage of motor vehicles.

They also said that a high prevalence of smokeless tobacco (SMT) such as khaini, gutkha, betel quid and paan masala is a public health concern in South Asian countries such as India, Bangladesh, and Nepal, with India alone accounting for 32.9 per cent of global deaths and 28.1 per cent of new cases of lip and oral cavity cancer in 2019.

""More than 50 per cent of the oral cancer burden has been attributed to smokeless tobacco, whose prevalence has grown in recent times in South Asia, including India,"" the team wrote.

SMT not only increases the risk of oral cancers but also enhances the risk of esophageal and pancreatic cancer, they said.

They wrote that improved water and sanitation can help reduce the transmission of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and, in turn, potentially lower the risk of stomach cancer.

The researchers wrote that as countries underwent development, they observed a common pattern of reducing cancer burden in younger age groups and increasing cancer burden associated with increasing life expectancy.

They found a reduced burden of cancers such as leukemia among those under 5 years of age between 1990 and 2019.

Simultaneously, they found a raised burden of cancers associated with longer lifespan such as prostate, pancreatic and breast cancer over the same time period.

""Mere availability of screening might not improve the survival rates if cancer treatments are either unavailable or unaffordable,"" the team wrote.

In the low- and medium-income countries (LMICs) of Asia, oncologic infrastructure is either scarce or unaffordable, particularly in rural areas. Combined with a weak referral system, patients end up getting delayed diagnosis and treatment, leading to lower survival rates, the researchers said.

Therefore, along with timely availability of cancer screening and treatment, its cost-effectiveness or coverage of treatment expenses must also be a policy priority, they said.

""Retail Consumption Trends by CMS is a macroeconomic indicator of retail purchases based on the cash collected & processed from 52,000+ organized retail touchpoints across India. It provides a view into consumers’ spending trends as seen in FY24 compared to FY23, which included the Cricket World Cup event, festival, and wedding season. The analysis takes a closer look at consumer preferences through the demographic lens, offering trends into consumer behavior in the country by measuring in-store and online retail purchases across various sectors,"" said CMS in a media release.

According to CMS, in the B2C segment, retail consumption witnessed an annual increase of 9.3% in the key 11 sectors, during the April–September 2023 period. The FMCG and E-commerce sectors experienced an annual increase of 26.2% and 19.4% respectively, during Q2-FY24, reflecting rising consumer demand in these sectors amid easing inflation. The Aviation and Hospitality sectors saw annual growth of 29.7% and 12.8% in Q2-FY24 respectively, reflecting increased demand for travel, driven by large events such as the Cricket World Cup. The jewelry sector saw an annual growth of 7.1%, in contrast to a 4.6% decline in Q2-FY23, suggesting higher spending triggered by the wedding season and endorsing post-pandemic demand bounce-back. The large format retail sector experienced an annual increase of 7.8% in Q2-FY24, driven by factors such as rising incomes, urbanization, and changing consumer preferences, the CMS analysis showed.

""From a demographic perspective, Metro cities which had grown the fastest from Q2-FY23 to Q1-FY24, were outpaced in H1 FY24 by SURU (semi-urban and rural), which saw the fastest consumption growth of 9.2% YoY, triggered by improved discretionary spending and demonstrating tailwinds in the rural economy,"" said CMS.

Anush Raghavan, President, Cash Management Solutions at CMS Info Systems said, ""CMS Cash Index™ (CCI) has proven to be a very powerful indicator to track commerce transactions by consumers and has been referred to by various policymakers as well. The surge in retail consumption parallels the 7.6% GDP growth in the Q2-FY24, boosted by easing inflation.Taking cues from these macroeconomic indicators, we expect astronger consumption growth in Q3-FY24, especially in FMCG, e-commerce, and aviation sectors.""

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/metro-station-inside-a-building-chennai-metro-unveils-big-property-plan-around-stations-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/106509716.cms,"Chennai Metro Rail (CMRL) has unveiled an innovative plan to develop properties around metro stations in three locations, including Thirumangalam. The aim is to integrate buildings, people, activities, and public transit, creating a transit-oriented development plan, a TOI report stated.

One of the most notable aspects of this plan is the inclusion of a 12-storey building at Thirumangalam, where metro trains will pass through and halt at the third floor station. A conceptual design for the building has already been released. Additionally, property development will also take place at Koyambedu and Thirumayilai, with both locations having a 12-storey building that will house the station entry/exit.

A CMRL official explained the rationale behind this initiative, stating, ""We have come up with a transit-oriented development plan where we are developing properties around metro stations to bring buildings, people, activities, and public transit together. Cost of building stations in the three locations is included in the phase-2 project. For property development, we will request funds from the state government.""

The acquisition of a 450-meter-long plot near Thirumangalam flyover, which previously had three houses, is a significant step towards implementing the plan. However, building an integrated corridor with a metro station above the flyover would require the dismantling of the existing infrastructure, potentially causing traffic disruptions. To avoid this, CMRL will appoint an agency to explore the possibility of renting the property.

Similar property development projects will take place at Koyambedu and Thirumayilai. In Koyambedu, vacant plots surrounding the phase-2 elevated station will be developed, and provision for a third line to Avadi will be made. Thirumayilai, on the other hand, will have at least one entry/exit structure located in a new multistorey building.

This concept of integrating property development with metro stations is not unique to Chennai. In other parts of the world, such as Chongqing, China, a 19-storey apartment complex features a metro station on the sixth floor. Similarly, a 15-storey star hotel is planned above the zero-mile metro station in Nagpur.

Former CMRL director R Ramanathan highlighted the importance of these property development projects in generating revenue. He stated, ""The operational cost and repaying of loans cannot be met with just ticketing revenue even if trains run full all the time. Putting up ads, allowing retail outlets in stations, and developing and renting properties are the only way to generate more revenue and break even.""

However, Sivasubramaniam Jayaraman of ITDP-India cautioned that the success of these property developments depends on the target audience. If the properties are designed solely for passengers, the impact on commuting habits may be limited. Jayaraman suggested that creating activity centers within these developments could encourage people to use private vehicles to reach the area rather than becoming regular commuters.

The country’s astounding economic trajectory finds its foundations in the resilient growth showcased by India’s foreign investment sector. Breaking all records, India recorded $112 billion in Inward Foreign Remittances in FY23, clocking an all-time high in the last five years, amid economic recovery after the catastrophic pandemic impact.

The country’s groundbreaking Inward Foreign Remittances is underpinned by the seismic shifts in the global landscape, presenting new opportunities to NRIs at the crossroads of the potential investment ecosystem. In 2024, India’s large and evolving investment market coupled with ardent policies, government initiatives, infrastructure development and enhanced connectivity will stand as a beacon of hope for NRIs looking forward to diversifying their investment portfolio.

Real Estate- The Backbone of Future NRI Investment
NRI’s preferred investment goal is shifting towards tapping into the Indian growth market and generating wealth. While other options exist in the form of FD, NPS, and other traditional schemes, NRIs are heavily focusing on Real Estate, especially commercial after witnessing the growth prospectus in the sector. As we venture into 2024, NRIs will continue to invest in the real estate landscape, backed by the convergence of factors such as high rental yields, favourable government policies, deep emotional connection and most importantly the tenacity demonstrated by the Indian real estate market in the face of adversity.

Decoding Preconceived Notions- Path to Trust
By breaking down the common misconception that NRIs can’t invest in India, the Indian investment scene will connect NRIs with their roots. The reality is more than simple! By following RBI guidelines established under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), NRIs can not only invest but can generate additional revenue streams. Further, the lack of an entrusting factor between the Indian diaspora abroad and third parties has been a hindrance dominating the investment ecosystem. However, in 2024, the acceleration of new-age NRI dedicated platforms driven by technology will be instrumental in making the investment process transparent, bolstering diverse NRI investments.

Short-term traders can look to buy the stock on dips for a possible target of Rs 372 in the next 3-4 weeks, suggest experts.

The stock rose from Rs 260 as on 3rd October 2023 to Rs 322 recorded on 1st January 2024 which translates into an upside of over 23% in the last 3 months. It rose more than 8% in a week.

The stock hit a record high of Rs 326.45 on 1st January 2024 and the chart pattern suggests that the rally is likely to continue.

The momentum helped the stock to break from the August 2018 swing high of Rs 304 last week and formed a ‘W’ pattern on the weekly charts, which has opened room for the stock to head higher.

In terms of price action, the stock is trading well above most of the crucial short- and long-term moving averages such as 5,10,30,50,100, and 200-DMA, which is a positive sign for the bulls.

The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 72.3. RSI above 70 is considered overbought. This implies that stock may show a pullback. The daily MACD is above its center and signal Line, this is a bullish indicator.


“Exide Industries stock is currently trading at its all-time high, maintaining a consistent pattern of higher tops and higher bottoms, indicative of strong momentum,” Vidnyan S. Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital, said.

“The stock has experienced a significant breakout, forming a W pattern and surpassing a multi-year swing high from 2018. This breakout signifies a robust structural development that has propelled the stock to higher levels,” he said.

The mean reversion strategy has been effective for Exide Industries, with the stock consistently bouncing back from the 12-week and 26-week EMAs.

“The ADX study, with a reading above 40, underscores the presence of a strong trend, and the bullish momentum is further confirmed by the +DI (Positive Directional Indicator),” highlights Sawant.

“We anticipate further upward movement in prices, targeting the 372 level. It is recommended to set a stop-loss at 303 based on closing values,” recommended Sawant."

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/starlink-launches-satellite-to-connect-mobile-phones-but-cant-compete-with-terrestrial-networks-musk/articleshow/106502928.cms,"Elon Musk’s SpaceX has launched the first batch of Starlink satellites with direct-to-cell capability that will enable mobile coverage anywhere on earth.

“The six Starlink satellites on this mission with Direct to Cell capability will further global connectivity and help eliminate dead zones,” SpaceX founder Musk tweeted Wednesday.

Musk added that this will allow mobile phone connectivity anywhere on Earth.

He, though, said the direct-to-cell satellites capability only “supports 7Mb per beam and the beams are very big, so while this is a great solution for locations with no cellular connectivity, it is not meaningfully competitive with existing terrestrial cellular networks”.

The latest developments come when Starlink is poised to receive a GMPCS permit soon from the government to launch satellite broadband services in India.

India has also been considering a recent proposal of top broadband-from-space players, Jio Satellite Communications (Jio’s satellite arm) and Bharti-backed Eutelsat OneWeb to provide mobile satellite services via enabled smartphones.

Last month, billionaire Musk’s private space venture was reportedly granted approval to test direct-to-cell calls between Starlink satellites and regular mobile phones. The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had approved SpaceX’s request for the new satellite technology for a duration of six months that will involve 2,000 test devices and 840 satellites using airwaves in partnership with T-Mobile.

A bench headed by Justice Suresh Kumar Kait said the petition was not maintainable.

""Petitioner has already moved bail application before the trial court.Present petition is not maintainable and is dismissed accordingly,"" the bench, also comprising Justice Manoj Jain said.

Azad's lawyer argued that the police custody was in violation of the provisions of the Constitution as she was not allowed to consult a legal practitioner of her choice to defend her during the trial court proceedings.

During the hearing, the high court said no such grounds of violation of her fundamental rights was made out.

In her petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus directing her production before the high court as well as an order to ""set her at liberty"", Azad said not allowing her to consult a lawyer of her choice amounted to violation of her fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution, making the remand order unlawful. The trial court has remanded her in police custody till January 5.

On December 21, the trial court had extended till January 5 the police custody of four accused, including Azad, arrested in the Parliament security breach case, after the city police said they needed to uncover all those involved in the conspiracy.

While the four were arrested on the day of the incident itself, two others were apprehended later.

In a major security breach on the anniversary of the 2001 Parliament terror attack on December 13, 2023, two persons identified as Sagar Sharma and Manoranjan D jumped into the Lok Sabha chamber from the public gallery during Zero Hour, released yellow gas from canisters and shouted slogans before being overpowered by some MPs.

Around the same time, two others- Amol Shinde and Azad- also sprayed coloured gas from canisters while shouting ""tanashahi nahi chalegi"" outside the Parliament House premises.

Besides the four accused, police have also arrested Lalit Jha and Mahesh Kumawat in the case. All are being interrogated in police custody.

The agitation by truck drivers, which was launched in several states in the country on Monday, continued on the second day, leading to non-delivery of petroleum products at depots and people rushing to petrol pumps amid the fear of fuel shortage.

In Maharashtra, the truck drivers have been staging protests at various places, including capital Mumbai, Nagpur, Solapur, Dharashiv, Navi Mumbai, Palghar, Nagpur, Beed, Hingoli, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Nashik, Gadchiroli and Wardha. In Nashik, the fuel transporters started the agitation at Panewadi near Manmad on Monday. More than 1,000 trucks and tankers were parked in Panewadi area as part of the nationwide protest.

Panewadi village near Manmad town in Nandgaon taluka of the district has fuel depots of various companies, including Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and Indian Oil. Fuel is supplied in many parts of the state from these depots. Indian Oil has an Indane LPG bottling plant also at Panewadi. As a result of the strike, long queues of people were seen at various fuel stations in Nashik city and parts of the district from Monday evening as reports of the transporters' strike and fuel shortage due to it created panic among people.

In a bid to find a solution, District Collector Jalaj Sharma and Superintendent of Police Shahaji Umap held a meeting with the transporters, dealers, petroleum company officials and other stakeholders at Panewadi on Tuesday. Following an assurance by the collector, the transporters agreed to call off the strike. It was decided to provide police protection if needed for the transport of fuel. As a result, transport of fuel resumed from Panewadi this evening, officials said.

""Representatives of dealers and transporters attended the meeting. We heard their concerns and assured them to take their grievances and views to the Centre. As a result, they agreed to resume their operations,"" collector Sharma said after the meeting.

""We will immediately send information regarding their issues and grievances to the Union government and workshops will be conducted for transporters to explain the new law to them and to clear the misunderstanding in their mind about its provisions. I appeal to people also not to panic as regular fuel supply will continue,"" he said.

Superintendent of police Shahaji Umap, who was also present for the meeting, assured that the police administration will take care that there will be no problems or obstacles for the transport of fuel.

Talking to PTI, Vikas Karkale, one of the agitating transporters, said, ""In the meeting, the district collector gave an assurance to us that our views and demands will be conveyed to the Union government. Therefore, we have decided to call off the strike and regular operations have started. However, if the Union government implements this law, we will again go on a strike.""

Under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), which replaces the colonial era Indian Penal Code (IPC), drivers who cause a serious road accident by negligent driving and run away without informing police or any official from the administration can face up to 10 years imprisonment or a fine of Rs 7 lakh. The punishment in such cases was 2 years in the British-era IPC.

Data center provider AdaniConneX Private Ltd. will use the money to fund its growth plans this year, with a five year tenor under discussion, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.

Adani Group representative did not offer any immediate comment.

AdaniConnex raised $213 million debt in June to build two data centers with an total capacity of 67MW, part of the group’s plans to spend about $1.5 billion on this business in the next three years.

The company is planning to build nine data centers and targeting a total capacity of 1 gigawatt by 2030. About 17 MW capacity at Chennai is already fully operational while others are being built.

The conglomerate has been regaining investor and lender confidence after denying US shortseller Hindenburg Research’s scathing allegations of corporate fraud in January last year. The group’s renewable energy unit plans to raise at least $2 billion in mostly new debt in 2024, Bloomberg reported last month.

The Mumbai-based company also aims to raise up to Rs 300 crore in equity funds for Gati, its express logistics business, a person in the know separately said on condition of anonymity.

""During the supply chain disruption, people order a lot of material. All the warehouses were full and there was no space. People over-ordered thinking this would continue,"" Shetty said. ""But with the sudden war in Russia and Ukraine, the world has changed dramatically. Commodity prices and interest costs went up. The governments stopped doling out money in the Western world.""


Global freight and shipping rates, which surged to record highs in 2021 and 2022, have now fallen back to pre-Covid-19 levels as inflation pressures squeeze consumption across the world and there is an oversupply of container vessels in the seas.

Allcargo Logistics' consolidated revenue - the largest chunk being its international supply chain operations - slid 35% year-on-year in July-September 2023, while EBITDA fell 68%.

Shetty said the cost cutting would include a rationalisation of the workforce and a freeze on hiring. ""The staff count and costs have gone down substantially"" he said.

However, things are looking up, he said.

""The signals indicate that December onwards will be definitely better. Inventory levels are now down and real orders are taking place, plus Chinese new year is coming up,"" Shetty said, adding the numbers will start ""looking up"" after April.

Allcargo Logistics is investing heavily in digitalisation, data security and centralisation of all its processes, including its financial systems, he said.

The push followed a cyber attack in 2021 which crippled the company’s systems for a week. “Today we are one of the most secure logistics companies in the world,” Shetty said. Allcargo Logistics has engaged firms such as Ingroup, KPMG and EY.

""By the end of 2024, we will have a global system, one operating system, one platform to transact our businesses,"" said Shetty.

Earlier this month, Allcargo Logistics said it will demerge its money spinning international business ECU Worldwide into a separate listed entity, Allcargo ECU Ltd, as the last step to restructuring its businesses. The restructuring started with selling the company's non-core assets, progressed to giving exits to its partners and acquiring their stakes in business, and has culminated with this demerger.

The Allcargo Group will now have four listed entities, including Allcargo ECU and Allcargo Logistics (which will include the express business after it acquired Gati). The other two entities will be Allcargo Terminals and TransIndia Real Estate, in each of which its promoters own 70%.

Shetty said Gati, which is still a loss-making and leveraged entity, will raise equity funds ""to create a five-year business plan, put in place systems, processes, invest in people, buy shares in Allcargo and retire debt"".

TransIndia Real Estate may take the alternative investment fund route to raise money, he said without elaborating.

Sources also said that truckers' body The All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) has so far not given a nationwide strike call in support of the demand for the withdrawal of new stringent imprisonment provisions for hit-and-run accident cases under the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita.

""There is strictly no nationwide strike called by AIMTC in the country and all the issues will be resolved amicably. They are meeting Home Secretary (Ajay Bhalla) later in the evening today,"" official sources said.

The office bearers of AIMTC, which is an umbrella body of truckers nationwide, want the government to withdraw the provisions claiming these being ""onerous"" and will create hardship for drivers.

Addressing reporters, AIMTC President Amritlal Madan said, ""The government must withdraw the provisions relating to hit- and run cases in the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita"".

He further said that the truckers association will decide on the future course of action after meeting with the Union home secretary in the evening.

Madan also said 60-70 per cent of all trucks are not on the roads right now due to the ongoing strike.

AIMTC Chairman-organising committee Bal Mankit Singh urged the government not to drag the issue for long as was done in the case of the Farmers law.

He regretted that the government did not consult with the stakeholders.

According to official sources, the government is seized of the matter and will make an effort to resolve the issue amicably.

Under the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS), which replaced the colonial-era Indian Penal Code, drivers who cause a serious road accident by negligent driving and run away without informing the police or any official from the administration can face punishment of up to 10 years or a fine of Rs 7 lakh.

The punishment in such cases was 2 years in the British-era Indian Penal Code (IPC).

The new provisions triggered strikes by drivers in some states, including Maharashtra, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, and Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.

Massive queues of customers were seen at fuel stations across these states on Tuesday as the truckers' strike hit supplies and triggered a panic buying by people.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/avenue-supermarts-shares-fall-over-3-on-q3-updates-should-you-buy-stock/articleshow/106505562.cms,"Notwithstanding a lower-than-estimated revenue growth reported by the Avenue Supermarts in its December quarter updates, top foreign and domestic brokerages remain positive about the prospects of the company that operates DMart stores. While Macquarie and Morgan Stanley have maintained their 'Outperform' and 'Overweight' ratings on the stock, domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal has reiterated its buy stance.

On Tuesday, the Radhakishan Damani-owned company reported a 17% year-on-year jump in its standalone revenue for the October-December quarter at Rs 13,247.33 crore versus Rs 11,304.58 crore in the year-ago period. The total number of stores as of December 31, 2023, stood at 341, the company said in its filing to the exchanges.

Avenue Supermarts shares fell over 3% to the day's low of Rs 3,962.05.

Here is what they recommended:

Macquarie: Outperform | Target: Rs 4,350
Macquarie has maintained an 'Outperform' rating on the counter though it slashed the price target from Rs 4,350 to Rs 4,450. The weaker-than-expected sales commentary and slower store additions remain a pain point, as it cut the FY24/25/26 EPS by 7% to factor in slower-than-expected sales momentum. The Australian brokerage remains optimistic about DMart's ability to offset apparel weakness.

Morgan Stanley: Overweight | Target: Rs 4,471
Morgan Stanley remains overweight on Avenue Supermarts stock for a price target of Rs 4,471. The US-based brokerage said that the company's Q3 operational metrics have improved further though pace of store additions needs to pick up. The Q3 standalone revenue was 5% lower than estimates that implied same store sales growth (SSSG) at 7%, the brokerage said in a note. As for the Q4 quarter, network expansion is a key monitorable for this brokerage.

Motilal Oswal: Buy | Target: 4,400
Motilal Oswal has recommended a buy stance on the DMart counter for a price target of Rs 4,400 which is an 8% upside from the price of Rs 4,019 at which it was recommended.

The standalone revenue for 3QFY24 grew 17% YoY and was 5% below its estimate. The revenue uptick was driven by a 5% growth in revenue per store to Rs 156.50 crore (annualised) and an 11% store addition, the brokerage note said. On a sequential basis, revenue grew 8%, led by 5% growth in revenue per store and merely 1% store addition, the report said.

In Motilal's view, the revenue per square feet saw a moderate growth of 4% YoY. In the last three years, it remained subdued due to the addition of larger stores and weak discretionary spending but this trend has been gradually reversing for the last 2-3 quarters, this brokerage said.

While the shift in the festive season was expected to benefit, the industry-wide commentary has indicated a persistent slowdown in the discretionary category in 3QFY24, which may be still hurting the non-food category (25-30% of revenue), the note said.

However, softening raw material prices should drive demand in the coming quarters, in Motilal's view.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/truck-drivers-protest-ev-owners-flood-the-internet-with-memes/articleshow/106504333.cms,"Long queues were witnessed at petrol pumps in several parts of the country following a protest by truck drivers against a provision in the new penal law regarding hit-and-run accident cases involving motorists.

There were reports of panic buying from various parts of the country. In Surat, Gujarat, protests even turned violent.

Yesterday, about 2,000 petrol pumps, mostly in western and northern India, ran out of fuel following the strike by truck drivers.

Some truck, bus, and tanker operators began a three-day strike on Monday against the stringent jail and fine regulations under the new criminal law, Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS), for hit-and-run cases. The protestors have blockaded roads and highways across states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh. Truckers said most truck drivers choose to run away even in minor accidents, as they otherwise will have to face mob justice and the risk of life. While the mobs typically go unpunished, imposing stringent punishment on drivers was deemed unfair.

The truckers, however, have now called off their strike following assurances from the Central government. In a late-night meeting on Tuesday, the Union Home Secretary reportedly assured the All India Motor Transport Association (AIMTC) that the law will only be implemented after consultation with the group.

Meanwhile, amid visuals of long queues that, in some areas, spilled into roads as well, electric vehicle owners took to social media to rub more salt into the wounds of their ICE counterparts.

""Petrol isn't available in petrol pumps due to the truck driver strike. Now, I am reminded why having an EV might be a good idea,"" tweeted one user.

Here are some other hilarious memes on Twitter.

The help desk will be open from Wednesday to Friday, between 10 am to 5 pm. Passes will be given on a first come first serve basis.

The help desk is located at Surya Khel Parisar-I, also known as Butchery ground, on Cariappa road in Cantonment area. It is adjacent to Army Public School (LBS Marg).

According to the defence PRO, individuals must bring their official identification proof in order to obtain the passes.

The passes will grant the public access to various events including the Army Day parade rehearsal at the 11 Gorkha rifles regimental center, Shaurya Sandhya - A Military Display on January 15 at 3:30 pm, and the Military Band performance on January 14 at 6:30 pm at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Smarak Park Gomti Nagar.

Please note that the 76th Army Day parade on January 15 morning will not be open to the general public.

India Army organises annual Army Day parade on January 15. This year it will take place in Lucknow, marking a departure from its traditional location in Delhi and its previous occurrence in Bengaluru. This shift is part of the army's initiative to enhance public involvement. In a deliberate effort to broaden the parade's reach, each of the army's six operational commands will be given the opportunity to host the event.

Similarly, this year's Navy Day was celebrated at the Sindhudurg Fort, situated off the Maharashtra coast and constructed by the 17th-century Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Navy Day, observed on December 4, commemorates the navy's 1971 attack on Karachi harbor during the conflict with Pakistan.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/adani-stocks-rally-up-to-10-ahead-of-supreme-court-verdict-on-hindenburg/articleshow/106501567.cms,"Adani Group stocks on Wednesday rallied up to 10% with the conglomerate's market capitalisation crossing the Rs 15 lakh crore mark after the Supreme Court said there is no ground to transfer the case to the CBI and asked Sebi to complete its probe into Hindenburg allegations in the next three months.

In the 10-pack group of stocks, Adani Energy Solutions was the top gainer as it shot up to 10% while Adani Total Gas and NDTV were up around 8-9% each.

Shares of Adani Green Energy, Adani Wilmar, Adani Enterprises and Adani Power were trading 5-6% higher. The Ahmedabad-based conglomerate's cash cow Adani Ports was up 3%.

After hearing a batch of pleas on the Hindenburg issue, a three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice DY Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra delivered the judgment today saying that the government and Sebi will look into infractions of the law, if any, by Hindenburg on short-selling and actions will be taken in accordance with the law.

The apex court also said that the facts of the case do not warrant the transfer of the probe into the matter to a Special Investigation Team (SIT) or other probe agency.

Markets regulator Sebi had in August submitted its investigation report to the court after completing probe in 22 out of 24 cases relating to allegations against the Adani group.

In its order today, the court asked Sebi to finish probe in the remaining two cases in the next 2 months and said the power of the top court to enter the regulatory domain of the regulator was limited.

Welcoming the ruling, Gautam Adani tweeted saying that the judgement shows that truth has prevailed. ""Satyameva Jayate. I am grateful to those who stood by us,"" he said.

While reserving a batch of pleas last month, the apex court had said it does not have to treat what was set out in the Hindenburg report as a ""true state of affairs"".

""We don't have to treat what is set out in the Hindenburg report as ipso facto (automatically) a true state of affairs. That is why we directed the SEBI to investigate. Because for us to accept something which is in the report of an entity, which is not before us and whose veracity we have no means of testing, would really be unfair,"" the bench, also comprising justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, had said last month.

Since the Hindenburg report was released on January 24 last year, Adani stocks have seen a roller-coaster ride. At one point last year, the combined market capitalisation of all 10 Adani stocks had fallen to less than half but gradually recovered following a spate of positive news, including investment by white knight GQG Partners.

While acting on PILs made in the aftermath of the Hindenburg report, the apex court had formed a six-member panel headed by former Supreme Court judge Justice AM Sapre that filed a report in May saying it cannot conclude whether there was any regulatory failure on the part of Sebi.

Later on in August, Sebi had submitted its investigation report to the court on allegations made against the group.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/interim-budget-may-be-a-non-event-but-not-for-all-stocks-heres-why/articleshow/106504108.cms,"Ahead of the presentation of the Interim Budget on February 1 by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, investors have started reducing their exposure to capex stocks as welfare spending in an election year may limit the incremental growth in government capex.

Global broking firm Jefferies has reduced its weight on L&T in its model portfolio to neutral and has also told clients that the impact of Budget on some stocks exposed to railway and defence capex program may be subdued.

""The central government capex has surged by 3x over the past 5-years, taking the govt capex to GDP ratio to all-time-high 3.3% of GDP in FY24. The incremental growth from here could turn limited, at least in FY25, as welfare spending pressures & budget consolidation takes a toll. We expect only about 7-8% growth in govt capex budget for FY25E,"" said Mahesh Nandurkar of Jefferies.

This low number might disappoint the market and stocks exposed to the government capex program may see some correction, he said, adding that the move will not derail the whole capex cycle as 75% of the capex in the economy is housing and private corporate related which has a multi-year upside ahead.

At a broader level, investors believe that the interim Budget will be a non-event for the market and that the Lok Sabha elections, Q3 earnings and central bank rate cuts would determine the trajectory of the market.

Historical data shows that Nifty has given negative returns 7 times in one-month periods preceding the Budget in the last 12 cases. The average return in the month period has been in the negative territory -0.32%.

The post-Budget one-month period has also been with a negative bias but without a clear trend as there have been 6 periods of negative returns.


Apurva Sheth of SAMCO Securities points out that the month of January hasn’t been very positive for the markets in the past. Nifty has generated negative returns in 13 out of the last 20 years, with an average return of -0.8%.

""Nifty has also witnessed a up move after it bottomed out around 18,837 in October 2023. Going ahead, chances of a consolidation are high after such an up move. There is a bearish divergence emerging on the daily RSI. Thus, all of the above indicators point to the fact that market participants must keep their expectations from markets low in January,"" he said.

A section of the market is also expecting some minor sops for the salaried class by likely tweaking of the tax slabs. ""The twin objective of minor relief to the taxpayers coupled with encouraging taxpayers to shift to a new tax regime is likely to be achieved by tweaking the tax slabs. However, the final budget will be presented by the newly elected government in the month of June-July 2024,"" Sunny Agrawal, Head of Fundamental Equity Research, Securities, said.

The announcement will not only have an impact on Adani Group stocks - there are 10 in total - as well a sentimental impact on the overall market. Investors appeared to be already baking in the possibility of a favourable judgement as Adani Group stocks today rallied up to 10%.

Adani Energy Solutions was the top gainer in the pack as it shot up to 10% while Adani Total Gas was up 8% and NDTV 7%.

Following the comments, Adani bulls heaved a sigh of relief. In the last one month, Adani Green Energy shares are up 56%, Adani Total Gas 43%, Adani Ports 30% and Adani Enterprises 24%.

The stocks are, however, yet to recover from the Hindenburg shock. On January 24, the US-based short-seller had released an 108-page report, which not only led to a crash in Adani stocks and also had a spillover effect on other stocks but also became a political issue, had called Adani's rise to the riches as the ""largest con in corporate history"".

READ: WHAT SC SAID ON ADANI-HINDENBURG ISSUE

— jugeshinder (@jugeshinder)

Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud led a bench that declared it could not regulate SEBI's investigative authority, pointing out that the agency has concluded its investigation in 22 of the 24 instances involving claims made against the Adani Group.

The top court further concluded that the case's facts did not support giving the investigation over to a Special Investigation Team (SIT) or other investigative body.

The top court on Wednesday pronounced a decision on a number of petitions pertaining to the Adani-Hindenburg case, which involved claims that the Indian conglomerate had manipulated stock prices.

While pronouncing the verdict, the CJI said the power of the top court to enter the regulatory domain of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) was limited.

Shares of 10-listed Adani Group companies pared some of their initial gains following the verdict with Adani Enterprises’ shares up 3.6 per cent in trade. The stock had risen 9.1 per cent during the day to its highest level in more than 11 months.

The SC in March directed SEBI to look into Hindenburg's claims. A six-person expert group led by AM Sapre was also established to determine whether any regulatory violations had occurred. In May, the panel declared that there was insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about regulatory shortcomings and that the company had not manipulated stock prices.

Dehadrai has lodged a complaint with the CBI and the home ministry, claiming that Moitra had obtained call detail records (CDR) of her ex-boyfriend without authorization. He alleges that she suspected her ex-boyfriend of having an affair with a senior functionary of a social media giant from Germany.

""I was shocked to discover that Moitra, with the help of senior Bengal police officers, had access to the complete CDR history of her ex-boyfriend. She possessed precise information about the individuals who had been in contact with him, as well as the exact location of his phone throughout the day,"" Dehadrai stated in his complaint. He attached screenshots of chats and a purported CDR list as evidence.

Responding to the allegations and the demand for a CBI investigation, Moitra stated, ""I urge the Ministry of Home Affairs to appoint a special director of the CBI to investigate complaints made by jilted exes across India. It is interesting to see that the self-proclaimed protector of privacy is included in the complaint. He has honed his surveillance skills while covering up for his leader in Gujarat. I am confident he can get to the bottom of this as well. Good luck.""

Dehadrai, who was previously in a relationship with Moitra, mentioned in his complaint that when he questioned her actions and expressed disapproval, she justified herself by claiming certain rights as a Member of Parliament, including the ability to keep tabs on whoever she chooses. The lawyer alleges that Moitra stated that certain IPS officials in the Bengal police were obligated to fulfill her requests and could not refuse her.

Dehadrai also expressed concerns about his safety, stating that he has strong reasons to believe that Moitra is using her connections with senior officers of the Bengal police to conduct illegal surveillance on him.

According to the BNS, ""Whoever causes death of any person by rash and negligent driving of vehicle not amounting to culpable homicide, and escapes without reporting it to a police officer or a magistrate soon after the incident, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description of a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.""

Dismissing as ""misplaced"" the apprehensions of some truckers, who are protesting against the new law and keeping off the roads, the functionary said the provision of hit-and-run cases will be applicable to only those drivers who will try to escape without the informing the police.

""The driver who informs police about the accident will not be prosecuted under the stringent law. If the driver fears that he will be attacked if he stops at the spot of the accident, he can go to the nearest police station or can call police or the toll free emergency helpline number 108 and inform about the accident,"" the functionary said.

In such cases, the driver just have to inform the police about the vehicle number, contact details and tell that he would cooperate in the investigation whenever required.

In such cases, the functionary said, the stringent provision of the law will not be applicable.

However, if the drivers runs away from the spot without informing the police, the strict provision of the law will be slapped.

Similarly, strong provision will be slapped in cases of drunken driving and subsequent accident.

The new provision of the hit-and-run cases where punishment has been extended to 10 years has been framed following the observation of the Supreme Court.

Sources said the Supreme Court had observed in several cases that drivers who drive negligently on the road, strict action should be taken against those who run away from an accident that results in someone's death.

Sub-section 106 (1) and sub-section 106 (2) of the BNS make it clear that if the person reports the incident of death by careless driving to a police officer or magistrate immediately after the incident, he will be charged under sub-section 106(1) instead of sub-section 106(2), which carries a punishment of up to five years, while sub-section 106(2) carries a punishment of up to 10 years.

Section 106(1) offence is currently bailable and section 106(2) is non-bailable, sources said.

Truckers in several states launched a three-day protest against the ""stringent provision"" on Monday.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/trade/exports/logistics/transforming-the-last-mile-new-delivery-models-technology-strengthen-logistics-in-india/articleshow/106505324.cms,"It is undeniable that the landscape of last-mile logistics in India has undergone a revolutionary transformation in the last few years, with key advancements reshaping the way goods are delivered to our doorsteps.

Some of the key themes that defined the evolution of last-mile logistics, setting the stage for a dynamic 2024 are:

1. Speed and customer experience: A quantum leap
The year 2023 witnessed a quantum leap in the speed and customer experience realm, as same day and next day delivery models took centre stage, especially for Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) commerce companies. Higher delivery speed has always led to improved revenue realisation due to a higher percentage of successful deliveries but typically have had the burden of a very high cost of logistics. This year however, the race for efficiency saw emergence of cost-efficient speed models challenging industry giants like Amazon. In hyperlocal as well, quick commerce, less than 15-minute delivery models settled down and now appear to be here to stay with last mile efficiencies seeing huge benefit in metros due to high densities. What truly makes this game-changing is that you now do not need to spend millions into building such a capability from scratch – several players from the third-party logistics industry have made giant strides in providing best in class speeds at very competitive costs.

Given above, we can expect adoption to these models grow multifold in the coming year, eventually reshaping the competitive landscape in 2024. The end consumer is sure to have a lot to look forward to.

2. Artificial intelligence redefining last-mile dynamics
Last year, artificial intelligence transitioned from a mere experiment to a driving force in last-mile logistics. Innovations in AI found practical applications, particularly in customer address intelligence and fraud detection. In the current landscape, numerous leading logistics players utilise in-house address correction algorithms, highlighting how precise customer addresses significantly enhance delivery success rates. We've moved beyond the era when shipments would mistakenly reach the wrong destination due to address or pin code errors – today, we can predict the correct address and rectify it at the source, saving not only time and money but, most importantly, enhancing the overall customer experience. Commerce companies that recognised and acted on this trend early have reaped substantial benefits, directly impacting their bottom line.

As the industry continues to leverage the power of AI, the year 2024 holds promise for further innovations, poised to elevate the precision and efficiency of last-mile logistics.

3. Electric revolution gains momentum
After years of trials and tests, 2023 witnessed the electric revolution gaining substantial momentum, with electric vehicles (EVs) securing over 20% market share in last-mile delivery. Last-mile delivery partners in India embraced this transformative shift, acknowledging the economic and environmental benefits associated with transitioning to electric. The impact was especially pronounced in metropolitan areas, where it became noticeably easier to spot delivery partners operating electric two-wheelers compared to previous years. This shift aligns seamlessly with the Government of India's vision of achieving 100% electric last-mile logistics by 2030, a goal that not only seems plausible but also imminent. State governments such as Delhi, actively contributed to this movement through initiatives such as the 'Delhi Motor Vehicle Aggregator and Delivery Service Provider Scheme,' which outlines firm timelines to achieve 100% electric vehicles in the city.

The steadfast commitment to sustainable practices is fostering positive change within the industry, setting the stage for a greener and more efficient future.

Anticipating strides in drone delivery and gender diversity
As we look forward to 2024, two areas with significant potential are drone delivery and the increased involvement of women in last-mile logistics. Advancements in technology are making the feasibility of drone delivery systems more apparent, promising quicker and more cost-effective deliveries. This is particularly evident in remote areas, where the delivery of critical goods, such as medicine, stands out as a prime use case. As practical tests continue to succeed, we anticipate drone technology gradually integrating into various stages of the supply chain – especially at legs where it is easier to control both the source and destination dynamics. Moreover, fostering gender diversity in the industry is not just a social imperative but also a strategic move. It allows tapping into a broader talent pool, thereby enhancing overall efficiency and inclusivity in last-mile logistics. We firmly believe that this will play a pivotal role in facilitating the expansion of supply chain capacity in India.

As we celebrate the successes and innovations of 2023, the future of last-mile logistics in India looks promising. The momentum gained this year sets the stage for continued advancements, creating a more efficient, sustainable, democratised, and inclusive last-mile delivery ecosystem.

On Tuesday, the Nifty Pharma index emerged as the leading sectoral performer, showcasing a remarkable surge of over 2%, significantly outpacing the broader indices. Notably, Cipla's stock experienced a breakout from a 97-day consolidation pattern on the daily scale, signalling a bullish trend. This breakout was supported by robust volume. Furthermore, the occurrence of a sizable bullish candle on the breakout bar adds strength to the positive momentum.

At present, the stock is trading above both its short and long-term moving averages, and these averages are following an upward trajectory in the preferred sequence, indicating a robust trend. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has surpassed the 60 mark and is trending upwards. The daily Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains in a bullish state, positioned above its zero line and signal line. Additionally, the MACD histogram signals an increase in upside momentum.

On the derivative front, the January series future has surged by 2.27%. The cumulative OI of the current, next and far series has surged by nearly 1.63%, which indicates an overall long build-up. A significant concentration of CALL open interest is evident at the 1300 strike, while substantial open interest on the PUT side is concentrated at the 1250 strike. Delving into the options chain, there has been a discernible accumulation of long positions from 1370 to 1270 CALL strikes. Conversely, on the PUT side, there is noteworthy PUT writing observed from 1310 to 1200 strikes. This indicates bullish momentum in the stock.

In light of the positive alignment of technical and derivative factors, we propose an accumulation of the stock in the zone of Rs 1285-1275 level, incorporating a prudent stop loss at Rs 1240. Short-term projections indicate a potential upward trajectory, with initial targets set at Rs 1350, and subsequent levels at Rs 1370.

Container Corporation is on verge of giving trendline breakout
On December 15, 2023, the stock reached its peak at 880, followed by a minor profit-taking phase. The downturn found stability in the zone of Rs 816-820 level, where the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) played a crucial role. The stock established a strong base near the 20-day EMA, triggering a rapid and substantial upward momentum.

Currently, the stock is on the verge of giving a horizontal trendline breakout on the daily scale. On Wednesday, the stock witnessed above its 50-day average volume, which is a sign of accumulation before the actual breakout happens. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has established a robust foundation within the 58-60 zone, and today's occurrence of a bullish crossover further reinforces the positive sentiment.

The derivative data signals significant long build-up, with a 1.71% surge observed in the January series future. Meanwhile, there is a nearly 6% surge in the cumulative Open Interest (OI) across the current, next, and far series. There is a notable concentration of CALL open interest at the 900 strike, followed by the 950 strike. While significant open interest on the PUT side is observed at the 860 strike. Talking about the option chain, from 920 to 880 CE strikes have witnessed a long build-up. While, on the PUT side, from 920 to 880 strikes have witnessed PUT writing. This clearly indicates bullish momentum in the stock.

Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 880-870 with a stop loss of Rs 850. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 920, followed by 940 in the short-term.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/three-arrested-for-raping-iit-bhu-student-opposition-alleges-accused-linked-to-bjp/articleshow/106504072.cms,"Two months after a woman student was allegedly gang-raped inside the IIT-BHU campus here, police have arrested three men in connection with the incident, officials said on Sunday.

Following the arrests, opposition parties hit out at the BJP government alleging that the accused persons are linked to the ruling party.

The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) demanded that police file a charge sheet in the case at the earliest and take action against those who protected the accused for two months.

The incident took place on the night of November 1. Following the incident, hundreds of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) students had held a protest on the campus and demanded that the entry of outsiders be banned.

According to the complainant, she had gone out of her hostel with a friend on the night of November 1. They were near the Karman Baba temple when three men came there on a motorcycle, forcibly took her to a corner and gagged her after separating her from her friend.

The accused then allegedly stripped the woman, made a video of her and clicked photos. They let her go after about 15 minutes and took her phone number, the complainant stated.

On the basis of the complaint, an FIR was registered under Section 354 (assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the Indian Penal Code and under provisions of the Information Technology Act at Lanka police station.

Subsequently, the charge of gangrape was added to the FIR, police said.

Three people -- Kunal Pandey, Anand alias Abhishek Chauhan, and Saksham Patel -- have been arrested in the case, said Shivakant Mishra, Station House Officer, Lanka police station.

Opposition parties targeted the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath-led government over the law and order situation in the state and alleged that those arrested in the case have links with the ruling BJP.

""For the BJP, 'Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao' is just a slogan. I had said at that time that BJP people are involved in this matter,"" Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Ajay Rai said in a post on X.

""The person who gang-raped an IIT BHU student is none other than BJP's Kunal Pandey, convener of Mahanagar IT cell, and Saksham Patel, who is the PA of Dilip Patel (Kashi zone president of the BJP). This is the evil face of BJP. Shameful,"" the Congress leader said in another post.

Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said in a post on X that those arrested for gang-raping the woman student are part of a new crop of BJP workers thriving under the patronage of senior leaders.

The government had to get them arrested due to the solid evidence in the case and the growing public anger, he said.

""Every woman across the country is seeing how the BJP is playing with women's dignity and protecting those accused of atrocities, harassment and rape. Women will not give even a single vote to the BJP in the upcoming elections. Women will be the reason for the BJP's defeat.

""The truth of the BJP is before the public today. The public will give its verdict by defeating the BJP in the upcoming elections and do justice to women,"" he said.

The Samajwadi Party, in a post on X, said sisters and daughters are unsafe in the state and BJP people are the only threat.

The party demanded the strictest punishment for the culprits.

In a statement, ABVP state media coordinator Abhinav Mishra demanded that police file a charge-sheet in the case at the earliest and also take action against those who protected the accused for two months.

The ABVP also called on the BHU administration to take appropriate steps to ensure the safety of everyone on the campus.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sustainability/future-proofing-the-cities-a-glimpse-into-future-of-urban-development/articleshow/106504818.cms,"As India enters 2024, the landscape of its urban centers is not just expanding but transforming. This change, driven by an amalgam of rapid urbanisation, technological innovation, and environmental consciousness, paints a vivid picture of the future of urban living. The transformation is both a challenge and an opportunity, shaping cities into crucibles of growth and sustainability.

India's urban narrative is marked by a significant demographic shift. With United Nations projections indicating that nearly half of India's population will reside in urban areas by 2047, cities are becoming the epicentres of economic activity. Contributing over 70% to the GDP, they stand as testaments to economic productivity. However, this urbanisation isn't without its share of challenges. The burgeoning urban population leads to issues like overcrowding, infrastructure strain, and environmental degradation. The transformation of rural settlements into peri-urban areas and Tier-III and IV towns adds to this complexity, reflecting similar characteristics of urban sprawl.

The Smart Cities Mission, a visionary initiative by the Indian government, embodies the nation's stride towards urban modernisation. It harnesses technology to forge cities that are not only livable and sustainable but also inclusive. While significant progress has been made, with advancements in areas like e-governance, waste management, and public transportation, the journey is fraught with challenges. These include funding constraints, lack of technical expertise, and the need for greater citizen engagement.

Environmental sustainability has emerged as a critical aspect of urban development. The adverse effects of rapid urbanisation, evident in the alarming levels of air and water pollution, pose severe health risks. This situation calls for urgent action to mitigate pollution and embrace sustainable practices. The phenomenon of urban heat islands further underscores the need for environmental focus in urban planning. Here, the application of RICS standards, particularly the Whole Life Carbon Assessments (WLCA), becomes pivotal. These standards offer a comprehensive framework for assessing and reducing the carbon footprint of buildings and infrastructure throughout their lifecycle, aligning with India's commitment to sustainability.

Transportation and infrastructure are at the crux of urban challenges and advancements. The lack of efficient public transportation systems has led to increased road congestion and pollution. However, cities are countering these challenges by investing in modern transportation infrastructure like metro rail systems and bus rapid transit corridors. Digital infrastructure advancements, such as ride-hailing apps and real-time traffic monitoring, have revolutionized urban mobility, enhancing efficiency and reducing congestion.

Housing and real estate dynamics are also shifting. The acute need for affordable housing is palpable, with government initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) aimed at providing relief to the urban poor. Concurrently, there's an increased demand for luxury apartments and gated communities, reflecting the changing economic and lifestyle patterns in urban India.

The social fabric of urban India is evolving with its cities. The infusion of diverse cultures and global influences has led to the adoption of new lifestyles and values. This cultural metamorphosis is giving rise to new subcultures that are redefining the urban way of life. Emerging lifestyle trends, such as the rise in fitness and wellness culture, sustainable living practices, and the influence of social media, are shaping the urban ethos.

In conclusion, the urban transformation of India is a multifaceted journey. It's a narrative of cities evolving from traditional urban centers to becoming hubs of innovation, culture, and sustainable development. The future of urban India lies in striking a balance between economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social inclusion. As India strides towards its urban future, its cities are not merely growing; they are evolving, promising a more sustainable, inclusive, and vibrant urban future for all.

The judgment would be delivered by a Bench headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, which had reserved its order on a batch of pleas last month.

In March, the apex court had formed a six-member committee to investigate the allegations filed by four petitioners in the wake of the explosive report filed by US-based Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group alleging corporate misgovernance, stock price manipulation and even terming it the “largest con” in the corporate history.

The report by the American short-seller in late January led to a major crash in stock prices of Adani Group companies, wiping out more than $100 billion in less than a month.

The report submitted by the six-member committee stated that it was not possible to conclude regulatory failure on the part of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in the stock price manipulation case.

The apex court had later asked the capital market regulator to submit its investigation report on the allegations made against the group. In August, SEBI submitted its report to the Supreme Court.

In November, allegations were made over a conflict of interest by Prashant Bhushan against the six-member committee. Bhushan alleged that SEBI did not carry out the due diligence in the Hindenburg case.

On November 28, the SC reserved its order in the case and said that the Hindenburg report against the Indian conglomerate cannot be treated as a true state of affairs.

This statement of the court saw Adani stocks rally sharply on Dalal Street.

Adani Group stocks will be in the limelight on Wednesday, and one needs to see whether they will get any New Year’s gift from the apex court."

SC said facts of the case do not warrant the transfer of the probe into the matter to a Special Investigation Team (SIT) or other probe agency.
New Delhi, The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the SEBI to complete its probe into two pending cases relating to allegations against the Adani group within three months. Holding that it cannot regulate SEBI's power of investigation, a bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud noted that SEBI has completed its probe in 22 out of 24 cases relating to allegations against the Adani group.

The apex court also said that the facts of the case do not warrant the transfer of the probe into the matter to a Special Investigation Team (SIT) or other probe agency.

The top court delivered its verdict on a batch of petitions on the Adani-Hindenburg row over allegations of stock price manipulation by the Indian corporate giant.

While pronouncing the verdict, the CJI said the power of the top court to enter the regulatory domain of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) was limited.

The judgment on the PILs, filed by lawyers Vishal Tiwari, M L Sharma, Congress leader Jaya Thakur, and Anamika Jaiswal, was reserved on November 24 last year.

The Adani Group stocks got bludgeoned on the bourses after Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including those about fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against the business conglomerate.

The Adani Group dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements."

Speaking at a recent roundtable discussion with Galatta Plus, Johar admitted to orchestrating positive reviews through carefully curated tactics.

Navigating Online Discourse
Johar, a prominent figure in the Indian film industry, acknowledged the influence of online discourse on a film's fate, pointing out that negativity often stems from warring fan clubs or individuals seeking viral attention.

He confessed to occasionally paying individuals to say positive things about his movies and acknowledged the changing dynamics of film promotion. ""Sometimes, we also as PR send our own people to praise the film; that also happens,"" Johar admitted.

This admission brings to the attention the behind-the-scenes efforts undertaken to create a favourable image, particularly for movies that may be perceived as average or struggling to make a mark.

The Producer's Last-Ditch Efforts
Johar, known for his work in films like 'Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani,' explained the motivation behind such maneuvers.

The director-producer pointed out that the intense competition in the industry often compels filmmakers to take unconventional measures. Johar stated, ""See, sometimes you’re also struggling to make a mark. Many a times you want to put out good videos. As a producer, you will do every last-ditch attempt to make your film be heard. So, while I may critique criticism, I’m also riding on their backs when they praise a film. I can come across as two-faced, but I am very well doing that as a person. I am changing as per films.""

In the cutthroat world of Bollywood, where every film competes for attention, he justified the need for such promotional strategies.

Shaping Perception Beyond Box Office Numbers
Johar highlighted the crucial role of a producer in steering a film's journey post-release, especially for middle-order films that require sustained efforts to create a positive aura. ""It’s a very interesting exercise,"" he remarked, shedding light on the continuous battle for attention and positive perception long after a movie's initial release.

While acknowledging the potential criticism that may come his way for these revelations, Johar maintained that as a producer, he adapts to the unique demands of each film. ""I change with every film. Some films work on their own, so I can take the high ground and stay quiet. Some films are average, so we need to give the impression that they’re doing better than they actually are,"" he explained.

Karan Johar's Upcoming Ventures
On the workfront, Johar, who witnessed major success with 'Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani' in 2023, is set to reunite with Salman Khan for the movie tentatively titled 'The Bull.' This collaboration marks a significant reunion after 25 years.

Further, speculations about a potential collaboration with Shah Rukh Khan add anticipation to Johar's future ventures, though an official confirmation is still awaited."

Various factors, including China's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, territorial disputes with neighboring countries like India and Taiwan, and its increasing geopolitical and economic assertiveness, have raised concerns among international corporations. Additionally, the ongoing trade tensions between China and the United States have created an opportunity for India to position itself as an alternative manufacturing hub.

India's ascent as a credible substitute to China is propelled by several encouraging indicators. The government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has undertaken substantial infrastructure development initiatives and focused efforts on bolstering the logistics sector. These endeavors are seen as pivotal steps to establish India as a manufacturing nucleus.

An example is the surge in Apple iPhone exports from India to unprecedented levels. Moreover, Apple has expressed intentions to transform India into a major manufacturing and export center, prompting its contract manufacturers to intensify their operations in the country.

Multinational corporations, including industry giants like Walmart and Apple, are increasingly directing their attention towards India, gradually reducing their reliance on China, a country entangled in trade disputes with the US and engaged in border conflicts with India.

However, despite this progress, there's acknowledgment that significant strides are necessary for India to substantially increase its global manufacturing share and Budget 2024 will need to take care of that.

India's potential to establish manufacturing prowess in burgeoning sectors positions the country as a strong contender for the role of the world's new-age manufacturer. This transformative leap also enables India to assume leadership in sectors experiencing a global demand surge, promoting its position in the export value chain.

To capitalise on this momentum, India needs to focus on forging trade agreements that make exports more lucrative for companies seeking to diversify their production. Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) could serve as catalysts for manufacturers in making crucial production decisions.

India has recently pursued bilateral trade deals or is in talks with various nations, including Australia, the UK, Canada, deviating from its conventional cautious approach to such agreements.

Key government initiatives such as PM Gati Shakti and the National Logistics Policy are set to provide a conducive ecosystem for India's manufacturing sector to flourish.

Budget 2024: Can interim budget make new kids, aka startups, happy?

The country has implemented several reforms, including the liberalisation of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) norms, the introduction of the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, opening up previously restricted sectors like defense and manufacturing, and making adjustments to labor laws. These measures aim to challenge China's dominance in manufacturing.

However, the interim budget will again need to throw light if more such actions are planned for India to be a solid alternative for the supply chain shift.

In addition to incentive-based programs like PLI, there is a growing call for increased allocation of funds towards upskilling and vocational training in the upcoming Budget. Strengthening skills required for emerging sectors will be pivotal for the next phase of manufacturing growth.

An effective budget strategy, offering financial and regulatory incentives such as PLI schemes, coupled with investments in infrastructure projects to mitigate domestic logistics costs, remains crucial. Improving India's overall supply chain efficiency through enhancements in transportation infrastructure is essential, considering India's current lag in global Logistics Performance Index rankings.

Strengthening these aspects in the budget will further solidify India's position as a manufacturing hub.

Continued efforts to simplify policies and regulations to enhance the ease of doing business will create an environment conducive for firms to thrive in India and the budget will have to address that as well.

However, there are challenges on the horizon. Fitch points out regulatory hurdles like a complex business environment and limited labor market reforms, which could deter foreign investments. Despite initiatives in states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to introduce labor reforms, resistance from labor unions poses a hindrance to progress. Additionally, India's high tariffs and limited support for free trade could impede its integration into global supply chains.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/smallcap-multibaggers-6-stocks-give-positive-returns-in-january-for-5-years/articleshow/106502842.cms,"While January has historically been an unlucky month for benchmark Nifty 50 in terms of returns, it was lucky for several stocks, particularly in the smallcap segment.

A review of the historical performance of smallcap stocks in January showed that atleast seven of them have given positive returns for five consecutive years.

Of the seven smallcap stocks with a market capitalization exceeding Rs 2,000 crore, six have more than doubled investors’ wealth in this period.

These six multibaggers are JTL Industries, Kirloskar Ferrous Industries, Cera Sanitaryware, Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals, Somany Ceramics, and .




Of the last 5 years, shares of the ceramic products maker have given double-digit returns during two instances in 2021 and 2023, respectively. In 5 years, the stock has given multibagger returns of over 118%.

In the last two years, mutual funds have steadily increased their holding, whereas foreign institutional investors reduced their exposure, according to Trendlyne.


Shares of the automobile component maker have given a staggering 526% returns to investors over 5 years. However in this period, it managed to give a double-digit return only once in January in 2020.

This stock has seen active participation by foreign investors, as they held 1.65% stake as of September end, compared to just 0.6% in March 2022.


This multibagger fertiliser stock has been a consistent performer in January, and gave double-digit returns during three instances in the last five years. Over 5 years, the stock has given 154% returns to investors. FII and MF activity in the stock has been pretty mixed in the last one year. While MFs reduced their holding in the last three quarters, FIIs increased exposure during the same period.


Shares of this smallcap healthcare stock have also been a consistent performer, giving double-digit returns during two instances in January in the last five years. Over the 5-year period, it has given multibagger returns of 112%. MF holding in the stock reached the highest level in more than two years during the September quarter to 8.56%, whereas FII holding dropped below 1% in the same period.


Smallcap stocks offer a variety to investors given the sheer number of companies in this segment, but they are most risky and vulnerable to external shocks compared to the largecaps.

In 2023, the BSE Smallcap index rallied 43%, surpassing the 20% rally of Sensex by a wide margin. This rally has pushed valuations of several stocks above the long-term average, asking for some caution.

“When there is a small and midcap rally and you see that market caps go up materially, suddenly the earnings of this company inflate because they are charging a percentage of the market cap..Given how the stocks have performed and given how they in general in this space have performed, again, it would not be imprudent to take some money off the table,” said Anshul Saigal, founder of Saigal Capital.

Sharing a similar view, Gaurav Dua of Sharekhan said they too, are asking clients to take some profits in smallcaps and increase exposure to largecaps.

“We also believe that rather than chasing highly valued growth stocks, one has to add some distinct value stocks also to the portfolio,” he said.

However, some of the sectors which have done well over the last one year, and are expected to continue the momentum in 2024 are capital goods, pharmaceutical, automobile and auto ancillary, and IT services. Analysts recommend accumulating quality stocks in these sectors on dips."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/take-some-chips-off-mid-smallcaps-5-largecaps-to-go-for-now-sanjiv-bhasin/articleshow/106503644.cms,"Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities, says “we have an overweight on Dr Reddy’s and Lupin. In banks, the market cap of ICICI Bank is now Rs 6.89 lakh crore. Another Rs 150 lakh crore will mean that this will be another entrant into the $100 billion club. The second would be Kotak. Arguably, the new helm is going to now lead from the front. . So, two bank largecaps and Dr Reddy’s and Lupin on the pharma side. We also have BPCL under our radar which can be an outperformer.”


Is it time to tread with caution a little bit given the January seasonality or do you think we could see the December momentum this month too?
Sanjiv Bhasin: I wish we could see that December momentum but wishes cannot be horses so there will be uncertainty, there will be little volatility which is part and course of the markets after running up so sharply. We are of the view that take some chips off the midcaps and smallcaps, get into some of the largecaps.

Largecaps are giving comfort. There will be a lot of FII buying by the way and that will be more concentrated on largecaps. Yesterday, we saw one single downgrade on Apple and it is down 6%, Nasdaq is down 250 points and the bank index is now one of the best performing indices. So, I think banks are going to be more proxy, they are largecaps, they are heavyweights. So, take some money off the table on your midcap and smallcap portfolio. Do not get lured by the feeling of missing out (FOMO) but be in the market. We are more tilted towards largecap banks, pharma and so on.

So, let us have your largecap list. What within pharmaceuticals would you recommend buying right now?
Sanjiv Bhasin: We have an overweight on Dr Reddy’s and Lupin. We are very bullish on Lupin and we have been there from Rs 750. Yesterday, it was up 6% against the market. And in banks, the market cap of ICICI Bank is now Rs 6.89 lakh crore. Another Rs 150 lakh crore will mean that this will be another entrant into the $100 billion club and I am looking at those milestones.

ICICI is a perfect case for that. It will be the biggest beneficiary of CASA ratio increase, the low-cost deposit and the sum of parts of businesses. I am giving a thumbs up to ICICI as an entrant into the $100-billion club, which means you can see at least a 15% upside in this stock.

The second would be Kotak. Arguably, the new helm is going to now lead from the front. They have all businesses which are firing on all cylinders, whether it is AMC, whether it is insurance, whether it is security and I think Kotak at this price gives me a lot of comfort. So, two largecaps over there and Dr Reddy’s and Lupin on the pharma side. We also have, as a disclosure, BPCL under our radar which we think can be an outperformer.

Given that you are pretty bullish on Vodafone-Idea, just wanted to get in your take on the recent news reports that have completely ruled out any investors for Vodafone-Idea, particularly billionaire Elon Musk. Do you think that that may have been fuelling the stock up move and now things could change?
Sanjiv Bhasin: I was bullish at Rs 11. At 18.5, I was not bullish. I mean, we have booked across the board. We are not in the camp which will buy on rumours. The real value lay at Rs 11 when you saw the ARPU strengthen, the government took a stake and I reiterate, there will be infusion of capital by someone unknown or the promoter. I still think any decline will be a buying opportunity. But as a disclosure, Rs 11 was a very fair point for us for a risk reward. At Rs 18.5, there will be rumour mongering and there will be volatility. But the stock has more than doubled in the last four months. Please take that with a pinch of salt.

I told you that the real value lies in unbundling when you know when you can have the risk reward. I will give you a similar example. At Rs 9.5-10, I liked JP which was among the most hated stocks. It yesterday hit a new high of Rs 23.5. Now, we are not asking you to chase it over there. Do your homework. Do your legwork and when you get these opportunities, some of these small or large or debt-ridden companies can be huge outperformers. Right now, we have a hold on Vodafone, but we will wait for more news flow on the infusion of capital before taking a next move.

In terms of a portfolio allocation towards PSUs specifically, should one take 15-20% profits off the table?
Sanjiv Bhasin: 100%, but remember most of the fund managers, particularly some of the PMSes said PSUs are taboo and you cannot have a view which is inelastic. Go with the market. REC, PFC, NTPC, Coal India have gone up three times. What more do you want? So, if you missed out, you are underperforming the indices. This is a time where money has been made. At Rs 35, nobody wanted to touch NBCC, at Rs 90 everyone falls in love.

It is just that the sheer ownership of some of these stocks can be frustrating, but time lasting. Now, I definitely take some money off and like I told you, I am very optimistic on the banks. I think their lending growth, their NIMs, their CASA all are looking good. So, stay with largecap. If ICICI is going to go into the $100 billion club, it gives me enough comfort, so does Kotak. It is a smaller bank like DCB Bank. We are looking for those ideas. PSUs are the ones which are the flavour of the day, the high beta play, which make money on a daily basis, but here you must take some chips off the block.

Take the chips off the block and keep the money in banks or buy something else?
Sanjiv Bhasin: No, there is no such thing as sitting on cash. It is better to be in largecap banks. I still like three PSUs -- IRCTC, CONCOR, and IEX and we are invested in those as a disclosure. They have just started to perform. We are up about 20% on our portfolio on these. But we will not change the business outlook. CONCOR, IEX, and IRCTC have a superb business model. It will only gather steam. The earnings and the price performance will be a little bit of a laggard.

But yes, do shift your portfolio. Zee is looking set to go to Rs 450 this year, so is DCB Bank. Paytm is giving an opportunity to get in now because most of the humdrum on exits is over. This stock is again headed to Rs 1,000. So do your legwork. Do your choosing. Find your right RM. Look at IIFL Securities or whichever brokerage you follow because the cardinal principle is, if you have a PMS or a mutual fund NAV, you are in the market.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/mf/analysis/why-are-investors-flocking-to-arbitrage-funds/articleshow/106502067.cms,"Arbitrage funds are now yielding more returns than liquid funds — and they come with better tax treatment. It is no wonder, therefore, that savers are buying into this asset class, with assets under management (AUM) climbing 60% in a year to Rs 1.38 lakh crore.

What is an arbitrage fund?
An arbitrage fund generates returns on the price differential in the cash and futures market. In such a scheme, the fund manager simultaneously buys a stock in the cash market and sells an equivalent quantity in the futures segment thereby generating a return for the scheme. The fund manager will not take any naked exposure to any individual security or an index as each buy transaction in the cash market has a corresponding sell transaction in the futures market. As per regulatory requirements, at least 65% of the corpus is allocated to arbitrage products, while the fund manager is free to choose the remaining 35% between arbitrage or debt products, depending on his view on the market.

Why are investors flocking to arbitrage funds?
Amidst a rising stock market and rising volatility, there are higher opportunities in arbitrage trades. High returns compared with savings accounts and better taxation are attracting investors to arbitrage funds. HNIs prefer these funds as they are treated as equity funds for taxation, which significantly increases post-tax returns. Investors holding such schemes for less than a year pay 15% capital gains tax, while if they sell after a year, they pay only 10% long-term capital gains tax. As compared with this, in a debt fund, rich investors have to pay short-term capital gains tax, which is 30%.

Do these funds carry risks?
Arbitrage funds rank high on safety. The scheme always has a market-neutral position by buying in the cash market and simultaneously selling the same security in the futures market. Compared with debt funds, where there could be some credit risk, there is no such risk here. As indices clock all-time highs and more investors turn to the stock markets, there is increased participation from both institutional and retail investors in the futures and options segment, leading to higher volatility and demand for money. That, in turn, pushes up returns in these schemes.

What returns have arbitrage funds generated in the past?
Over the last one year, data from Value Research showed arbitrage funds generated 7.09% returns. This is higher than savings bank accounts that generate 2.7-3.0%."

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/trade/exports/insights/irans-red-sea-power-play-raises-fears-of-trade-disruption/articleshow/106501399.cms,"Iran’s dispatch of a warship to the Red Sea is its most audacious move yet to challenge US forces in the key trade route, emboldening Houthi militants whose missiles have disrupted shipping over the past two months.

Tehran is unlikely to want direct confrontation — its old frigate being no match for the US-led maritime task force patrolling the waters off Yemen — but it takes the projection of Iranian power in the region to another level. That’s raising tensions after the Houthis started attacking vessels they claimed were headed to or owned by firms in Israel in a bid to end the military assault on Gaza.

Iran has rejected calls from Western powers to pressure the Houthis to end their attacks in the Red Sea. Some of the latest ships targeted by the rebels don’t have clear links to Israel, according to Kevjn Lim, a Tel Aviv-based analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence. That includes an attack on an AP Moller-Maersk A/S container ship, after Denmark said it was joining the task force.
Bloomberg
“They aren’t showing a willingness to deescalate, so we’re likely to see further targeting of commercial assets and US maritime ships going forward,” Lim said.

In response to the Houthi attacks, some of the world’s biggest shipping firms have refused to transit through the Suez Canal, complicating flows between Europe and Asia and forcing some vessels to take the more costly route around the Cape of Good Hope. Copenhagen-based Maersk and Germany’s Hapag-Lloyd AG said on Tuesday they were extending their pause on passing through the Red Sea.

In a reflection of the gravity of the situation, the United Nations Security Council announced plans to hold an emergency meeting on the Red Sea tensions Wednesday. The attacks pose “a grave threat to international commerce and maritime security,” US mission to the UN spokesman Nate Evans said in a statement.

On Tuesday evening, Houthis fired two anti-ship ballistic missiles from Yemen into the southern Red Sea, US Central Command said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.

Multiple commercial vessels reported the impact of the missiles into the surrounding water, though none reported any damage, the US said. It was the 24th attack in the southern Red Sea since Nov. 19, it added.

“There is a real risk of escalation here and we’ve already seen some of that unfold in the last few days,” said Dina Esfandiary, a London-based senior adviser for the Middle East at the International Crisis Group, referring to the death of 10 Houthi fighters in an exchange with the US Navy Sunday. “The Houthis have made it clear they are not afraid to follow through on their threats.”

On Monday, Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian blasted what he called the West’s double standards on Gaza, accusing the US and its allies of caring more about disruptions to global trade than civilians being killed in Israel’s bombardment of the Palestinian enclave. Israel says its aim is to destroy Hamas, which attacked on Oct. 7 and is designated a terrorist group by the US.

Amirabdollahian’s comments followed a meeting with Mohammed Abdulsalam, one of the most senior figures in the Houthi movement, and talks on Sunday with UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron, who told him Tehran had to rein in the rebels.

“Iran will continue to support the will and desire of the Yemeni people,” Amirabdollahian said.

Joel Rayburn, a former US diplomat and military commander, said the Iranian leadership has chosen to take bold steps against Israel and the US, including in the Red Sea, as part of a strategy to project its own power in the region.

Still, Iran may be reluctant to enter into a direct war with the US, not least after Washington’s loose implementation of sanctions allowed Tehran to boost oil exports.

“This Iranian destroyer is just for media consumption, targeting a domestic and regional audience — displaying Iran as a regional power capable of deploying naval assets to challenge the US,” said Riad Kahwaji, the Dubai-based head of the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis. “But it is unlikely that this destroyer will confront the Western warships in the area because Tehran does not want to get in a war with the US.”

Iran’s moves in the Red Sea offer reminders of another vital chokepoint that Tehran has long threatened to disrupt if its interests are imperiled: the Strait of Hormuz that connects the Persian Gulf with international oil markets. That would pose a bigger threat, traders say.

A hypothetical Hormuz closure could see crude prices surge 20% within a month and potentially higher thereafter, according to Callum Bruce, a London-based analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. That scenario appears unlikely, though, as it would probably prompt a more forceful global response, he said.

Even so, the Houthis feel emboldened, benefiting from greater popular Arab support since the Israeli attacks on Gaza, according to Esfandiary.

“If the tit-for-tats get out of control and each side refuses to abide by the other’s red lines, then we have a real powder keg here,” she said."

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported a minimum temperature of 9 degrees Celsius in Delhi, with the maximum temperature expected to reach around 20 degrees Celsius. The IMD also predicted extreme cold weather in the coming days, with temperatures dropping to 7 degrees Celsius on January 3.

According to the Meteorological Department, visibility was severely affected in several regions. In Rajasthan, Bikaner, Jaipur, and Ajmer reported visibility of less than 200 meters each. In Jammu Division, Jammu recorded a visibility of 200 meters, while Ambala in Haryana and Sagar in East Madhya Pradesh also reported visibility of 200 meters. In Delhi, Sardarjung recorded a visibility of 500 meters, and Palam recorded 600 meters.

Visuals from the Indira Gandhi International airport showed dense fog covering the area, leading to delays in several flights. The Indian Railways reported that at least 26 trains arrived late in Delhi due to the fog. These included trains from Bhopal, Bangalore, Bhubaneshwar, Ranikamlapati Bhopal, Howrah, Chennai, Puri, Kanpur, Saharsa, Rewa, Prayagraj, Azamgarh, Bhagalpur, Rajendranagar, Banaras, Ambedkarnagar, Hyderabad, Katihar, Jammutawi, and Ajmer-Katra.

To cope with the harsh weather conditions, homeless people in Delhi sought refuge at night shelters. They praised the facilities provided by the government, including free food, washrooms inside the tents, and dedicated staff for security. People were also seen sitting by bonfires to keep warm as the temperature dropped.

Despite the challenging weather and dense fog, preparations for the Republic Day parade continued at Kartavya path in Delhi. However, the Meteorological Department issued a weather warning for Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan, stating that these regions could experience dense to very dense fog and cold to severe cold day conditions. Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir's Jammu Division were also expected to witness fog at isolated places.

Discomfort due to the cold weather was also reported in areas surrounding Delhi, including Agra, Meerut, and Mathura. The IMD highlighted that visibility was significantly reduced in these regions, with Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh recording the lowest visibility at 25 meters.

In response to the increased number of accidents caused by fog, the Uttar Pradesh transport commissioner issued strict instructions. The commissioner stated that individuals below 18 years of age would be prohibited from driving. Violators would face imprisonment for three years and a fine of Rs 25,000.

The IMD categorizes fog as 'very dense' when visibility is between 0 and 50 meters, 'dense' when visibility is between 51 and 200 meters, 'moderate' when visibility is between 201 and 500 meters, and 'shallow' when visibility is between 501 and 1,000 meters.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/sunil-taldar-named-airtel-africas-ceo/articleshow/106484168.cms,"Airtel Africa, the wholly owned subsidiary of Bharti Airtel, has appointed Sunil Taldar as the chief executive officer of its operations. The development comes with the telecom major announced the retirement of the current chief executive Olesegun “Segun” Ogunsanya, with effect from July 1.

Taldar, who will assume the role of the managing director and chief executive of the group from July 1, joined the Africa group in October 2023 as Director, Transformation.

“The Board is delighted to appoint Sunil Taldar as the Group's next chief executive officer. His industry experience, strategic vision, constant customer focus and proven record of delivery will enable him to deliver our strategic objectives and to lead the Group in the next stages of its development,” Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman of Airtel Africa said in a statement.

Going forward, Ogunsanya — who led the company’s Nigeria operations and mobile money business for nine years before being appointed as CEO of the group in 2021 — will become the Airtel Africa Charitable Foundation’s inaugural chair, the company said.

Under Ogunsanya’s leadership, Airtel’s Africa unit was made a part of the coveted FTSE 100 Index effective in January 2022, which was significant milestone in just two-and-a-half years of its listing on the London Stock Exchange.

“Now is the right time for me to handover to a new leader who can build on Airtel Africa’s strengths and deliver on the significant opportunities ahead as I pursue my renewed interest in the empowerment of Africans through digital and financial inclusion in a different capacity beyond the boundaries of for-profit organizations,” Ogunsanya said.

In July 2022, a few months after Ogunsanya had assumed the reins, Airtel Africa inked a deal to sell roughly a 7.5% stake in its mobile money unit to Qatar Holding LLC, an affiliate of Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), for around $200 million.

Ogunsanya will also be available to advise the chairman, the Airtel Africa Board, and chief executive officer for a 12-month period, the company added.

“I am pleased Segun has agreed, following his retirement, to assume the new role as Chair of the Airtel Africa Charitable Foundation, where he will bring his visionary leadership to this new philanthropic initiative to advance development and prosperity across Africa. Segun will retire from the Board with our very best wishes and sincere appreciation for everything he has achieved,” Mittal said.

We do not know from which pocket it will come, but the market does not have too much appetite for bad news because it is already discounting the rate cuts starting March, April. So, we will have to be mindful.”

What do you believe is really going to be the call for the year ahead given that across the globe, we will be mapping out 40 elections. But that aside, how do you see the overall sentiment shaping up for the year ahead? Is volatility going to be the name of the game?
Anurag Singh: We are at a point where everything is almost richly valued. So, it is very hard to find value. Of course, in the US, there are pockets of value. Indian markets are very richly valued across the board. So, yes, the year, at least if I talk in terms of US markets, I think what we are focussed on is trying to park money towards the Russell 2000 stocks which are more of the midcap, smallcap stocks or S&P 600 stocks, plus the financials and consumer discretionary which did not have a good run.

We all should be mindful that just about seven stocks contributed to about 80% of the rally last year, except for the last two months which were pretty broad-based. I think that is where the value is and today if we saw a bit of a glimpse that some money is moving out, at least at the ETF level money would move out from Nasdaq more towards these S&P 500, S&P 600 or Russell 2000 value-based stocks, that is where we are. It is not very easy to find value. It is richly valued and you will have to struggle a bit. That is the broad thesis.

Is it too early to assume that the macros are reversing in the world?
Anurag Singh: Yes, that is where we are stuck. I think it has become and we should be a little fearful that a bull case and a soft landing has become pretty much a consensus case and that is exactly when trouble strikes. We do not know from which pocket it will come, but the market does not have too much appetite for bad news because it is already discounting the rate cuts starting March, April. So, we will have to be mindful.

But on the face of it, it looks like there is no apparent risk, at least not to the US economy and the Federal Reserve has a buffer, they are already at 5.5%. In case some trouble hits, they can always use that Fed put and come down and cut rates. So, at least in the US, there is no trouble on the horizon, at least which cannot be met with a Federal Reserve move. India is a different story and a bit of a different game really.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/visit/france-becomes-first-european-country-to-issue-digital-schengen-visas/articleshow/106502963.cms,"France will become the first European country to issue digital Schengen visas to visitors for the upcoming Paris Olympics. France has announced plans to shift entirely to online procedures for 70,0000 French Schengen Visas, in a move that aligns with the EU's digitalization plans.

France began operations of the ""Olympic Consulate"" system from January 1, 2024 - dedicated to processing visa applications for the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The ""Olympic Consulate"" is expected to handle applications from 15,000 international athletes, 9,000 journalists, and delegations from foreign countries participating in the upcoming sporting events. The initiative aims to streamline the visa application process, avoiding any mix-up with the surge of files currently undergoing processing at French visa centers worldwide.

Athletes and officials holding a valid multiple-entry Schengen visa won't need to apply for a separate French Schengen visa. Instead, they can use their existing visa, emphasizing the necessity of obtaining accreditation for the games.

Last year, the European Union announced plans to turn the Schengen visa digital. In November, European Union foreign ministers adopted a change to shift the process of applying for visas to visit the Schengen area to an online platform. Once enforced, this will eliminate the need for visa applicants to obtain a sticker in their passport, streamlining the application process and doing away with consulate or service provider appointments.

The Schengen area includes 23 of the 27 EU member countries, along with associated neighbors Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.

Fernando Grande-Marlaska, Spain's Interior Minister and the current holder of the EU presidency, said that the online visa system ""will streamline the application process for travelers."" Once operational, visa applicants for the Schengen area can submit required documents, data, and electronic copies of their travel documents, including biometric information, and make payments through the online platform.

Upon approval following cross-verification with databases, applicants will be provided with a cryptographically signed barcode for either printing or storing on a device. However, individuals applying for the first time or those with new passports or modified biometric data may still necessitate an in-person appointment.

Every individual entering the European Union, regardless of possessing visas or visa waivers, will go through processing via the automated EU Entry/Exit System (EES), expected to be in operation by the conclusion of 2024. The EES will record individuals' particulars, biometric data, entry and exit dates, facilitating the monitoring of overstays and instances of refused entries."

Most new supply is likely to get absorbed, and key business markets such as Delhi and Mumbai and leisure markets such as Kashmir could see up to 15% increase in hotel room rates this year, they said.

“In the dynamic Indian hospitality market that is being fuelled by robust economic growth and the prospects of an imminent achievement of a $4 trillion economy, the steady rise in demand is undeniable,"" said Nandivardhan Jain, CEO of hospitality advisory firm Noesis Capital Advisors.

""We can expect rates to go up by 10% this year over last year. The maximum addition in the branded supply segment won’t be over 25,000 rooms this year and that too will be spread across quarters. There are a lot of emerging markets such as Ayodhya, Varanasi and Deogarh that are likely to contribute to an uptick in demand,” he said.

“The listed hotels' market cap, currently at Rs 1.2 lakh crore, is anticipated to reach Rs 1.5 lakh crore by the end of 2024,” said Jain.

Nikhil Sharma, market managing director, Eurasia at Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, said he anticipates a 7 -10% increase in same store room rates compared to 2023. “This trend is expected across India rather than being confined to any particular market. Prices could be going up because there’s a bigger demand for popular places to visit and events are taking place at venues such as Bharat Mandapam and the Jio World Convention Centre,” he said.

Ajay K Bakaya, managing director, Sarovar Hotels & Resorts, said by and large rates will go up across key markets. “The supply takes much longer to come in. Business markets such as New Delhi and Mumbai are doing well and the supply addition won’t be as much. The rates could go up by 10-15% in these markets. I expect markets such as Chennai and Hyderabad to see an uptick of about 10%,” he said. “A leisure market such as Kashmir sees booming demand and the supply is very limited. It could see an uptick upwards of 15%.”

Jaideep Dang, managing director, hotels and hospitality group at JLL, said because of the growth in office leasing in key markets, occupancies are expected to remain robust and room rates will be upwardly stable.

MP Bezbaruah, secretary general, Hotel Association of India, said to match the growth of domestic tourists and to accommodate the long-term target of achieving 100 million foreign tourist arrivals, India should aim to have 5 million branded rooms by 2047. “That is why providing incentives in the form of an infrastructure status for hospitality is crucial,” he said.

Still, the reading was above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for a 30th straight month.

""India's manufacturing sector continued to expand in December, although at a softer pace, following an uptick in the previous month. Growth of both output and new orders softened, but on the other hand, the future output index rose since November,"" said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC.

New orders placed with Indian manufacturers, according to the survey, rose sharply but to a lesser extent in December. The pace of expansion was the slowest seen in 18 months.

On the positive side, input costs for manufacturers rose at the second-slowest rate in nearly three-and-a-half years, the survey said. In addition, manufacturers were at their most upbeat in three months about the coming year.

December data also showed an increase in international order receipts at goods producers in India. Companies noted gains from clients in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North America. However, new export sales expanded at a moderate pace that was the slowest in eight months.

For the fourth consecutive month, the rate of inflation for charges exceeded that of input prices. Companies that increased their fees in December attributed it to passing on recently absorbed cost burdens to clients. HSBC India PMI data for the end of the third fiscal quarter indicated minimal pressure on manufacturers' capacity. Employment remained relatively stable in December, with the seasonally adjusted index just slightly above the no-change mark of 50.0.

From type of policy to coverage details to waiting period to limit and sub-limits to exclusions to free-look period to portability to guidance on the procedure for claims submission to turn around time for settling the claims to contact details for filing complaints — all will be available ""in simple language in a snapshot"" in the customer information sheet in the preferred language of the policyholders.

What is a customer information sheet (CIS) of a health insurance policy?
A customer information sheet or CIS gives you a glance at the key policy details in a summarised format. Usually, the insurer provides a customer information sheet with the policy at the time of purchase and renewal of the policy. The new format of the customer information sheet will help the policyholders understand the complex terms and procedures related to their health insurance policies better.

How new customer information sheet of your health insurance policy will look from January 1, 2024
According to a format prescribed by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), your CIS will have the following details

1) Name of the insurance policy
2) Policy number
3) Type of insurance product: Indemnity, benefit, or both indemnity and benefit.
4) Sum insured (basis): The amount will be mentioned here.
5) Policy coverage: What your health insurance policy covers.
6) Exclusion: What your health insurance policy does not cover.
7) Waiting periods
8) Financial limit: Sub-limit, co-payment, deductible, and any other limit as applicable.
9) Claim procedure: Turn around time for claims settlement for i) pre-authorisation of the cashless facility, ii) cashless final bill authorisation.
The details of online links of the following will be mentioned:
i) Network hospital details
ii) Helpline number
iii) Hospitals which are blacklisted or from where no claims will be accepted by the insurer.
10) Policy servicing: i) Call center number of the insurer; ii) Details of company official
11) Contact details/web links for grievance/complaint filing
12) Things to remember:
i) Free-look period
ii) Policy renewal
iii) Migration and portability
iv) Change in sum insured
v) Moratorium period
13) Your obligation: You need to disclose all pre-existing diseases or conditions before buying the policy. Non-disclosure of pre-existing conditions may affect your claim settlement later.

Additionally, it will also highlight the policy clause numbers for each of the above-mentioned fields (where it is applicable) to make the policy more transparent to the customer.

Further, the insurers are also required to obtain signatures of the policyholders confirming that they have noted the details of CIS and received it, IRDAI mentioned earlier.

How will this updated CIS benefit the health insurance policyholders?
Typically, the health insurance policy document is very lengthy, and has very complex wordings which makes it very cumbersome for most policyholders to carefully examine crucial information. The updated CIS or customer information sheet, will provide policyholders with a quick, convenient guide about their policies, said many industry leaders. ""This initiative addresses a longstanding challenge for policyholders – deciphering the complexities of their coverage. On average, a standard health insurance policy document has 10,000+ words with a reading time of 1 hour and 15 mins, and a reading comprehension score so low that it should be difficult for most English-speaking adults to even understand. With the proposed CIS, insurers are mandated to communicate policy details clearly and concisely, ensuring transparency. Notably, the inclusion of claim settlement timeframes is a significant improvement, setting expectations for policyholders,"" says Abhishek Poddar, Co-founder and CEO, of Plum.

""A simpler CIS will reduce the complexities, policyholders find while dealing with their service experience. This step is expected to result in better-informed policyholders, reduced grievance, higher renewals, and seamless health insurance experience for policyholders,"" says Anand Singhi, Chief Distribution Officer, Reliance General Insurance Company Limited.

""The new CIS will also provide a hassle-free experience at the time of hospitalisation, as they will not have to deal with voluminous policy documents. Additionally, this simple-to-follow and uniformly formatted customer information sheet will help policyholders understand policy clauses, any restrictions, sub-limits, claim procedures, and requirements with sheer ease. In case the policyholder does not have time to go through the detailed policy document, they can study the policy summary carefully via CIS,"" says Siddharth Singhal, Business Head, Health Insurance, Policybazaar.com."
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/how-to/drivers-protest-what-is-the-new-hit-and-run-law-how-is-it-more-stringent-than-the-old-one/articleshow/106473327.cms,"Truckers ended their strike after two days of protest after Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla stated that the implementation of the new penal provision related to hit-and-run cases will only occur after consulting with the All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC). Bhalla urged AIMTC and protesting drivers to resume work, emphasizing that the new laws are not yet in effect.

Truck drivers and bus operators in some states had protested against provisions in the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita for hit-and-run cases. Under the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS), which replaced the colonial era Indian Penal Code, drivers who cause a serious road accident by negligent driving and run away without informing the police or any official from the administration can face punishment of up to 10 years and a fine of Rs 7 lakh. Many transporter and farmer organisations gave strongly criticised the new law and demanded its immediate repeal.

What is the new hit-and-run law?
The recently enacted Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita introduces stringent penalties for hit-and-run incidents in India. The law specifies that an accused individual causing a fatal crash and fleeing the scene without reporting to authorities could face imprisonment for up to 10 years along with a fine. Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita has established two distinct categories under the umbrella of ""causing death by negligence.""

The first category addresses causing death through any rash or negligent act that does not amount to culpable homicide. Offenders in this category may face imprisonment for up to five years and a fine. The second category deals with causing death through rash and negligent driving, not amounting to culpable homicide. If the individual escapes without promptly reporting the incident to a police officer or magistrate, they could be subjected to up to 10 years of imprisonment and a fine.

Despite the law's intentions, experts highlight the need for greater clarity on how an accused or driver should inform authorities, considering the potential risk of facing public anger at accident scenes. Additionally, safeguards are required to prevent potential misuse of this provision.

Road safety experts say that there is a need to define the type of evidence that will be accepted to authenticate claims by victims or accused individuals, preventing potential misuse.

What was the earlier hit-and-run law?
Previously, individuals accused in hit-and-run cases were tried under Section 304A of Indian Penal Code, facing penalties of up to two years in jail upon identification. The introduction of the new Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita signifies a substantial shift toward more severe consequences for hit-and-run offenses in India.
